1079,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-8646198-1,Extracted,"The present report describes the case of a 92-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in 2009 and was being treated with phenprocoumon (Marcumar®) for stroke prevention. Pre-existing comorbidities were arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, mild senile dementia and renal insufficiency. Ongoing treatment of comorbidities comprised the following: 95 mg metoprolol succinate, twice daily; 10 mg torasemide, once daily; 20 mg omeprazole, once daily; 2 mg glimepiride, once daily; 20 mg furosemide, once daily; and 80 mg febuxostat, once daily; combined with speech therapy and physiotherapy. Despite being treated with phenprocoumon (Marcumar®), the patient experienced an ischaemic stroke in 2016. The patient presented at Philippusstift Hospital, Hülsmannstrasse 17, 45355 Essen, Germany in August 2016 with the first clinical signs of stroke (hemiplegia, gaze turn to the right, anarthria, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 13). Cranial computed tomography confirmed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in the distal M1 segment. Lysis of the thrombus using systematic treatment was not performed. Her measured international normalized ratio (INR) values during the months prior to stroke were within the therapeutic range of 2–3, but on the first day of hospitalisation due to stroke, her INR was found to have decreased to 1.25. During hospitalization, the patient’s INR values normalized ().
The patient’s sodium and potassium levels were within normal range throughout the hospital stay (sodium, 137–145 mmol/l; potassium, 3.92–4.82 mmol/l), and renal parameters were elevated but consistent with her present diagnosis of renal insufficiency. These values improved during hospitalization, and at discharge they matched those recorded at an outpatient appointment prior to the drop in INR and ischaemic stroke. Liver parameters were slightly pathological, but stable during hospitalization and consistent with the patient's previous morbidities (). Phenprocoumon (Marcumar®) treatment, together with physiotherapy and speech therapy, were maintained during hospital stay and continued following hospital discharge. At the latest follow-up, the patient was able to walk a distance of 80 m, had no further speech or swallowing difficulties, and had no further stroke symptoms.
A retrospective inquiry revealed that the patient received daily personal care from her daughter, and thus had a controlled daily routine, and did not reveal any significant changes in the personal behaviour of the patient or to therapy adherence that may have led to an ischaemic stroke, other than the consumption of 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) of hard-boiled candy liquorice in the days leading up to the stroke. In the present case, the liquorice candy contained liquorice extract, as well as ammonium chloride, sugar, flavouring, and colourant E153. As a result, an intensive literature review was performed to investigate whether the consumption of liquorice candy may explain a sudden fall in INR values prior to the stroke. The PubMed and Ovid Medline databases were searched for articles published between 2001 and 2021 using the terms ‘Liquorice’ AND/OR ‘phenprocoumon’ AND/OR ‘ischaemic stroke’ AND/OR ‘herbal substances’ AND/OR ‘cytochrome P450’ AND/OR ‘vitamin K antagonists’ AND/OR ‘PPARα’. Articles that focused on interactions between phenprocoumon and herbal substances in patients and animals were selected from the search results. Following review, articles that were most relevant in terms of quality and mechanistic insight into the interaction between phenprocoumon and liquorice were selected for discussion. The search was conducted by two independent investigators (HCR and SB).
The University Hospital Essen does not require institutional ethics review board approval for reporting individual cases or case series, thus ethics approval was not obtained. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of the case report, and the reporting of this study conforms to CARE guidelines.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [92, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': False, 'Hypertension history': True, 'Stroke': True, 'Vascular disease history': True, 'Diabetes history': True}",8,8,8,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.
The patient is 92 years old. Because the age is greater than 74, two points added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.
The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 3.
The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present. Because the patient has diabetes, one point is added to the score, making the current total 7 + 1 = 8.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 8."

At admission, her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg and pulse rate was 76 beats per minute. She was 152 cm in height and weighted 62 Kg. Physical examination was unremarkable. Preoperatively, renal function was moderately decreased (creatinine, 0.95 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen: 16.5 mg/dL, uric acid: 5.7 mg/dL, sodium: 144 mEq/L, potassium: 4.1 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, phosphorus 3.7 mg/dL). During the thoracoscopic esophagectomy, blood loss was 460 ml, and hemodynamics were stable.
Postoperatively, approximately 2 L of hypotonic fluid (0.2% saline with 4.3% dextrose) daily were administered, urine volume was stable (1.1–1.8 L), and plasma sodium levels were unchanged (140 mEq/L). However, on the third postoperative day, she suddenly developed polyuria (3.8 L/day) together with a decrease in CVP (). Serum sodium levels dropped to 124 mEq/L on the next day. Despite volume-to-volume correction with isotonic saline, the serum sodium levels dropped to a nadir of 112 mEq/L together with hyperkalemia (5.6 mEq/L) on the fifth postoperative day, and her consciousness level deteriorated. When her urine volume was 3.8 L and 3.5 L, there was a negative water balance (without including perspiration); −0.9 L and −0.5 L, respectively. The hematocrit value increased from 27.4% to 33.7% during the 2 days without blood transfusion. The next day, our department was consulted for further evaluation. She appeared dehydrated and there was an additional decrease in her CVP to a nadir of 1 cm of H2O. Laboratory findings on consultation are shown in . Urinary sodium concentrations were markedly high and serum uric acid levels were decreased from 5.7 mg/dL to 1.4 mg/dL. Urinary N-acetyl-β-glucosamininase (NAG) and β2-microglobulin were high and the calculated maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) was relatively low (2.4 mg/dL), suggesting proximal tubule dysfunction. Furthermore, the calculated transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) value was low (3.6) for her serum potassium levels (4.7 mEq/L), suggesting that aldosterone action at cortical collecting duct (CCD) was impaired. These features were not consistency with the diagnosis of a SIADH. Thus, she was diagnosed as having SLN due to renal tubular dysfunction. Sodium correction was done with 3% saline and fludrocortisone was started at a dose of 0.05 mg/day. Thereafter, urinary volume decreased and there was a gradual increase in serum sodium levels to 138 mEq/L and serum uric acid levels to 3.4 mg/dL. Her consciousness level completely recovered. On the 20th postoperative day fludrocortisone was discontinued and she was discharged. She has been followed as an outpatient without recurrence of the hyponatremia.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.,"{'age': [72, 'years'], 'weight': [62.0, 'kg'], 'sex': 'Female', 'Sodium': [144.0, 'mEq/L']}",0.797,0.757,0.837,"The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.
The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 72 years old. The patient's is a Female.
The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly female's, the total body water percentage value is 0.45.
The patient's weight is 62.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mEq. To convert from 144.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 144.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 144.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 144.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 144.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.45 * 62.0 * (144.0/140 - 1) = 0.797 L. The patient's free body water deficit is 0.797 L."

Renal biopsy was performed, and it showed no glomerular lesions. In addition, immunofluorescence (IF) disclosed no immunoglobulin and complement deposition. He was pathologically diagnosed with MCD, for which he received various immunosuppressive drugs including steroid pulse therapy, mizoribine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil for FRNS. However it had been difficult to maintain long-term remission. Twenty-one times of recurrences had occurred before having a tonsillectomy, and more than half of them were triggered by tonsillitis. He was diagnosed by an otolaryngologist with chronic tonsillitis, as he had four or more episodes of acute tonsillitis a year, and bilateral palatine tonsillectomy was performed for chronic tonsillitis to reduce the recurrence of tonsillitis. Informed consent for the operation was obtained from the patient. On admission, his height was 161.5 cm, body weight was 60.6 kg and blood pressure was 118/64 mmHg. No abnormality was observed on general physical examination. Urinalysis showed urine specific gravity of 1.021 and pH of 7.5. By urinary qualitative, urine protein and occult blood were negative. Urinary protein level was 0.02 g/day; β2-microglobulin was 139 μg/day. His blood urea nitrogen was 15.0 mg/dL, albumin was 4.0 g/dL, creatinine was 0.59 mg/dL, and cystatin C was 0.69 mg/L. Immunoglobulin and complement levels were normal.
The pathological findings of the tonsils are shown in Fig. . The lymphoid follicles and germinal centers were observed various sizes. The boundary of each follicle was unclear and the distance between follicles was expanded. T-cell nodules were enlarged due to infiltration of CD4+ cells. Abnormal reticulation of the crypt epithelium was observed by cytokeratin staining. Peripheral blood CD4 + CD25+ Treg count increased from 379/μL to 444/μL between 2 months pre and post tonsillectomy. After the tonsillectomy, the patient was followed up for 3 years, and the average number of recurrences of NS per year decreased from 1.1 times to 0.33 times.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

2378,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-7860507-1,Extracted,"An 8-month old male infant presented with bilateral cryptorchidism since birth was referred to our hospital and hospitalized. His mother had tocolytic treatment prior to his birth. The patient’s medical and family history revealed nothing unusual. The patient had received no prior treatment for the bilateral cryptorchidism. Physical examination showed that the patient was 68.5 cm high, weighed 9.5 kg, had a head circumference of 42.4 cm and was in good general health except for the bilateral cryptorchidism. Examination of the patient’s four limbs and chest, palpation of the spine and musculoskeletal examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient had normal vision and hearing. An X-ray revealed no obvious pulmonary abnormality. The patient had bilateral flat and empty scrotum with no split and there was no obvious inguinal mass on either side (Fig. a, b). The patient had a properly developed corpus cavernosum and normal urinary meatus. B-mode ultrasound indicated bilateral cryptorchidism and visualized a left testis of 1.4 × 0.8 cm and a right testis of 1.2 × 0.6 cm in the lower abdominal cavity. In addition, the ultrasound also visualized the upper margin of the left testicle as a hypoechoic mass extending to the spleen. The ultrasound findings suggested an undescended right testis and a possible SGF on the left side (Fig. a). The ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality in the patient’s heart, liver or spleen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualized no obvious testis on either side and no obvious abnormality in the patient’s heart, spleen or liver. In addition, MRI showed no obvious uterus, ovary or fallopian tube-like structures. As to the patient’s kidneys, both the ultrasound and MRI visualized kidneys with normal sizes and shapes at normal positions, intact renal capsule, and renal pelvis and ureter that were not dilated, In addition, per our routine practice, we assessed the patient’s External Masculinization Score (EMS) to summarize clinical features representing his genitalia and to determine the degree of masculinization of this male infant, he had an EMS score of 10 out of 12 []. Overall, our physical examination of the patient ruled out other obvious congenital disorders.
We also screened for genetic variant(s) related to disorder of sex development with panel based next generation sequencing (NGS) test using multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The NGS test did not reveal any known SGF related genetic variant, although the test did indicate that the patient carries a missense mutation in the gene encoding SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1) (c.2608G>A [p.Gly870Ser]), a causative variation for Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (OMIM #269150) [], a frameshift or nonsense mutation in SETBP1 known to cause autosomal dominant mental retardation-29 (OMIM #616078) [], and a mutation in the oligophrenin-1 gene (OPHN1) known to cause X-linked mental retardation with cerebellar hypoplasia (OMIM #300486) [].
The first laparoscopic surgery was performed on January 11, 2018, single-site laparoscopy revealed closed internal rings on both sides, right testis in the in the iliac fossa, positioned approximately 2 cm above the right internal ring, at about the same height as the junction between the iliac vessel and the ureter (Fig. b, c). It also showed that the left testis was about 3.5 cm above the left internal ring and 1.5 cm above the junction between the iliac vessel and the ureter, and that the left testis was fused to the spleen with a clear demarcation (Fig. d). In addition, the left and right vas deferens were also visualized. No obvious uterus, ovary or fallopian tube-like structure was visible. The laparoscopic examination further revealed that the patient’s right spermatic vessel was poorly developed and short (Fig. b, c). A diagnosis of undescended right testis and continuous SGF on the left side was made. The patent’s Internal Masculinization Score (IMS) was also assessed during the examination as part of our routine practice to summarize clinical features of his internal sex organ and to determine the degree of masculinization of the male infant, and he had an IMS score of 9 out of 10 [].
As the European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline for paediatric urology recommends that “If a testis has not concluded its descent at the age of six months (corrected for gestational age), and since spontaneous testicular descent is unlikely to occur after that age, surgery should be performed within the subsequent year, and by age eighteen months at the latest” [], we decided to perform the orchiopexy immediately. Considering the fact that the positions of the patient’s testes were high and in the abdominal cavity, and that the right spermatic vessel was poorly developed and short, it would be very difficult and risky to complete their descent into the scrotum through the internal rings and inguina or through the straight hernia triangle with single-stage Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy. It has been reported that although the risk of postoperative testicular atrophy was comparable between single-stage and 2-stage Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy, 2-stage Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy could lead to a more favorable testicular position in the scrotum []. As the patient’s mother had history of multiple miscarriages and received tocolytic treatment prior to the patient’s birth, the patient’s parents wanted the procedure to be as safe and effective as possible. Therefore, we decided to perform separate 2-stage laparoscopic staged Fowler-Stephen orchiopexies for both the left and the right sides. In order to reduce the risk of bilateral testicular atrophy, we decided against performing Stage 1 for both the left and the right sides simultaneously. Rather, we decided that Stage 1 for the right side should be performed first, if it was successful, Stage 2 for the right side and Stage 1 for the left side should then be performed months later, and if this was also successful, Stage 2 for the left side should be performed months after that. We completed stage 1 of laparoscopic staged Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy for the right testis without treating the SGF on the left side during the same single-site laparoscopic examination. Ultrasound monitoring immediately after the surgery revealed that the right testis had normal shape and good blood supply. B-mode ultrasound taken four months later (May 2, 2018) visualized a right testis of 1.2 × 0.6 × 0.6 cm with a normal shape and good blood supply and a testis-shaped hypoechoic mass of 1.5 cm × 0.8 cm extending to the spleen with good blood supply.
7 month later, on August 20, 2018, stage 2 of laparoscopic staged Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy for the right testis (descent of the right testis into the scrotum), separation of the left testis from the spleen as well as stage 1 of laparoscopic staged Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy for the left testis were performed. Ultrasound monitoring immediately after surgery revealed that both testes had normal shapes and good blood supply. B-mode ultrasound taken 4 months later (December 12, 2018) showed a right testis of 1.0 × 0.6 × 0.6 cm and a left testis of 1.1 × 0.5 × 0.4 cm, both with adequate blood supply.
Stage 2 of laparoscopic staged Fowler-Stephen orchiopexy for the left testis was performed 7 months later (March 12, 2019), the left testis descended into the scrotum. The residual spleen tissue was cut from the left testis (Fig. e) and post-operative biopsy confirmed that it was accessory spleen tissue. Ultrasound monitoring immediately after surgery revealed that both testis had normal shapes and good blood supply, it also visualized smooth tunica vaginalis and multiple hyperechoic spots without acoustic shadows indicating possible testicular microlithiasis (Fig. a–d). B-mode ultrasound taken 1 month later (April 20, 2019) revealed that both testes were in the scrotum and that the left and right testes had a size of 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm and 1.3 × 0.8 × 0.7 cm, respectively. Both testes had healthy blood supply and the spleen had a normal shape. The patient had an uneventful recovery and suffered no adverse or unanticipated events. Follow-up ultrasound 1 year after the surgery revealed no obvious abnormalities in the shapes of the testes or their blood supply (Fig. e, f) and the patient’s penis and scrotum had normal appearance (Fig. c).",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

108,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-6311974-1,Extracted,"A 38-year-old man presented to an emergency department with progressive weakness and decreased urine output after having vomited up to 20 times per day over a period of 7 days. The patient was referred to our intensive care unit. Before medical consultation, he was healthy, and no other symptoms were reported. Diarrhea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain was absent.
Clinical examination revealed a patient of normal weight (height: 180 cm, weight: 70 kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated (150/80 mmHg, 105/min); the respiratory rate was normal (13/min), but oxygen saturation was low (89%). During blood pressure measurement, a positive Trousseau sign was noted. The mucous membranes were dry, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation (pH: 7.71 [7.35–7.45], base excess: 40.5 mmol/l [-2-3 mmol/l], pCO2: 56.1 mmHg [32–45 mmHg], pO2: 43.5 mmHg [83–108 mmHg], bicarbonate: 72.2 mmol/l [21–26 mmol/l], lactate: 2.8 mmol/l [0.5–1.6 mmol/l], chloride: 52 mmol/l [98–106 mmol/l], sodium: 130 mmol/l [136–146 mmol/l], potassium: 2.4 mmol/l [3.5–5.1 mmol/l], ionized calcium: 0.77 mmol/l [1.15–1.29 mmol/l] and glucose: 165 mg/dl [70–105 mg/dl]).
Ultrasound revealed a distended and full stomach; the inferior vena cava was collapsing on inspiration. Otherwise, the ultrasound was unremarkable. The electrocardiography [] showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc 547 ms).
Laboratory tests were consistent with acute kidney injury (creatinine: 5.2 mg/dl, urea: 176 mg/dl); liver function tests, coagulation tests, albumin, lipase, procalcitonin, total calcium, hemoglobin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Leukocytes were minimally elevated (11500/μl).
We suspected a prerenal acute kidney injury and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric losses of HCl and fluids. Initial management consisted of oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia and intravenous fluid therapy with normal saline and potassium chloride. Initially, a balanced crystalloid solution was infused, and later normal saline with KCl (40 mmol/l) was used because of the higher chloride content. Metoclopramide was administered to promote gastric emptying. To prevent further gastric losses of HCl, a proton-pump inhibitor was given. The patient was put on nihil per os for 24 h.
After 24 h, a total of 4.5 l of crystalloid fluid was infused. There was no further vomiting. A repeated bedside ultrasound revealed an empty stomach. The pH was corrected to 7.49, bicarbonate was reduced to 48.6 mmol/l, base excess was 23.4, chloride was 69 mmol/l, and potassium was still low at 2.8 mmol/l. There was hypoventilation with a pCO2 of 68.4 mmHg. We noted onset of diuresis. After 72 h of fluid therapy, the acid-base and electrolyte status was normal. Creatinine had decreased to 3.5 mg/dl. Small meals were tolerated.
Since there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for the excessive vomiting and the ultrasound had shown a distended stomach, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed []. A significant stenosis of the duodenum was diagnosed. Although there was no ulcer visible, an occult ulcer was deemed to be possible. A portal hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed while esophageal varices were absent. Helicobacter pylori testing was positive, so an eradication therapy was initiated. A repeated endoscopy confirmed the stenosis, but again, no ulcer was seen. Since a focused abdominal ultrasound did not reveal the reason for the stenosis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out malignancy such as pancreatic or gallbladder cancer or a thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. There was no evidence of malignancy or cirrhosis. An endosonography was done without evidence of malignancy or mesenteric vein thrombosis. At that point, the stenosis had partly resolved, and endoscopic passage was possible. We concluded that the temporary duodenal stenosis was caused most likely by portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and our differential diagnosis included idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension after exclusion of cirrhosis and portal vein obstruction.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [38, 'years'], 'weight': [70.0, 'kg'], 'height': [180.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [5.2, 'mg/dL']}",19.071,18.117,20.025,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 38 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 5.2 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 180.0 cm, which is 180.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.8 m. The patient's weight is 70.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 70.0 kg / (1.8 m * 1.8 m) = 21.605 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 21.6, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 70.0 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 38) * 70.0 * 1) / (5.2 * 72) = 19.071 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 19.071 mL/min."

He reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea, and presented persistent AF on EKG. He had a weight of 68 kg, and a height of 170 cm (BMI = 23 kg/m2), with high estimated thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2VASc = 4). He was previously prescribed with anticoagulation (Dabigatran 110 mg bid), beta-blocker (bisoprolol 5 mg od), ACE-inhibitor (ramipril 5 mg od), diuretic (furosemide 50 mg) therapy. A 2D-echocardiogram documented left ventricle dilation (LVEDD (end diastolic diameter): 61 mm) with systolic dysfunction (EF (ejection fraction): 38%). A 2D-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed absence of images referable to atrial and auricular thrombosis. Single-lobe left appendage displayed reduced function with velocity peaks of 25 cm/sec. The left atrial area was 28 cm2. No relevant atherosclerotic plaques were found in the thoracic aorta. Written informed consent was obtained and the patient underwent radiofrequency electrical pulmonary veins isolation plus roof and mitral isthmus ablation lines during systemic intraprocedural heparinization (activation clotting time (ACT)-target: 300–350 s). Electrical cardioversion was also performed due to presence of persistent AF. The total procedural time was 180 min. Dabigatran was temporarily interrupted for 36 h across the procedure and the patient was discharged the next day. After one week he was admitted to the emergency department for sudden dyspnea, being hospitalized for acute heart failure. At admission the EKG showed sinus tachycardia, while chest X-ray depicted bilateral alveolar edema. During hospitalization, after achieving hemodynamic stabilization, the patient suffered aphasia and space-time disorientation with near loss of consciousness. The Angio-CT (computational tomography) showed hypodense lesions in the left cortico-subcortical temporo-occipital area and in the left cerebellar hemisphere as showed in . Carotid and vertebral arteries were free from hemodynamic atherosclerotic plaques. Symptoms completely disappeared after two days and at the 24 h CT scan control, the lesions were stable, in the absence of hemorrhagic transformation. After a few days, the patient complained left limb pain and an acute distal embolism was diagnosed. A new transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a further deterioration of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF: 30%) with no evidence of intraventricular thrombosis and a clearly discernable interatrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt, this was likely attributable to the trans-septal puncture performed during the ablation (). Ultrasonography of the groin region documented in situ not compressible left femoral vein thrombosis (). Non fractioned heparin infusion was administered with complete resolution of both the arterial embolic occlusion and venous thrombosis. After a few days, oral anticoagulation with apixaban was initiated and the patient was discharged. At the six months follow-up, he presented with mild cognitive impairment, which persisted overtime till the last visit.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",65.937,62.64,69.234,"The patient's gender is Male.

5539,26,Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-3470992-1,Extracted,"A 17-year-old South Asian man was referred to our department for recurrent episodes of generalized muscle weakness, fatigue and cramps from the age of two years. Hypokalemia was initially detected at the first episode and he was treated for periodic hypokalemic paralysis. Before the age of 12 years, these episodes were mild, readily improved with ringer lactate and potassium chloride by his treating physician and occurred only twice a year. Beyond the age of 12 years, these episodes gradually worsened in frequency and intensity to the point that they were refractory to previously administered therapies and sometimes required hospitalization.
His symptoms were aggravated by physical activity and hot weather, and were associated with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, paresthesias and occasional painless non-bloody diarrhea. He denied the use of any medication, including laxatives and diuretics. He also had a history of short stature and poor weight gain. His birth history was unremarkable but developmental landmarks were delayed. There was no family history of renal salt-wasting syndromes or delayed puberty. However, his parents were first cousins.
An examination revealed a thin and lean, but well-oriented adolescent with no acute distress. His height and weight were below the third percentile (weight 30kg; height 147cm). His blood pressure was 95/60mmHg with orthostatic changes. His sexual development was at Tanner Stage II.
Investigations at the admitting hospital revealed a normal leukocyte count, platelet count, hemoglobin level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. His urea level was 34mg/dL, creatinine 0.9mg/dL and random blood glucose 105mg/dL. His estimated glomerular filtration rate based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula was 97.9ml/min per 1.73m2. His high blood urea nitrogen level was attributed to mild dehydration due to the hot weather. He was found to have metabolic alkalosis: pH 7.58, HCO3- 33.5, base excess +7.6. His serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium 124mmol/L, potassium 2.4mmol/L, calcium 6.5mmol/L and phosphate 3.4mg/dL. His serum magnesium level was not checked at that time. Serum albumin, creatine phosphokinase, free thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and parathyroid hormone levels were normal.
He was provisionally diagnosed with periodic hypokalemic paralysis and hypocalcemia. Treatment was started with potassium and calcium supplements. After one month, he showed little improvement and he was referred to our department for further evaluation.
Further laboratory tests revealed a low magnesium level (1.2mg/dl) and decreased 24-hour urinary excretion of calcium (25.9mg/24 h). Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were also normal. His level of testosterone was low (0.85ng/mL, normal for his age 2.67 to 10.12ng/mL). Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm and prolonged QT interval. No abnormality was found on an abdominal X-ray, chest X-ray or brain magnetic resonance imaging. A renal ultrasound revealed a prominent pelvicalyceal system. An insulin tolerance test showed normal cortisol and growth hormone response.
Based on the findings of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis without hypertension, severe hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria, a diagnosis of GS was made. No organic cause of hypogonadism was established and the sex hormone findings were attributed to delayed puberty. Treatment was started with oral supplementation of potassium, magnesium and calcium along with spironolactone and liberal salt intake. Our patient and his parents were also counseled about delayed puberty.
A limitation to this case report was that the diagnosis could not be ascertained with sequencing of the implicated gene due to unavailability of genetic sequencing at the presenting hospital (Jinnah Hospital Lahore, Pakistan).",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [105.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [124.0, 'mmol/L']}",124.12,117.914,130.326,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 124.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 124.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 124.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 124.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 124.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 124.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 105.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 124.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (105.0 - 100) = 124.12 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 124.12 mEq/L."
3686,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-3983425-1,Extracted,"An 18-year-old 170-cm-tall male weighing 51 kg was admitted via the emergency room complaining of palpitations, dyspnea, and cyanosis. The patient was born with complex congenital cardiac anomalies, consisting of a single ventricle (right ventricle type), a complete endocardial cushion defect, corrected transposition of the great arteries, right isomerism, and a supracardiac type total anomalous pulmonary venous return. The patient underwent correction of the total anomalous pulmonary venous return and bidirectional cavo-pulmonary shunt when he was 11 months old, and a Fontan procedure at age 3 years. The patient was taking aspirin (200 mg), digoxin (0.25 mg), enalapril (5 mg) and, atenolol (12.5 mg) daily. The initial vital signs were a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 126 mmHg and heart rate (HR) of 116 beats/min. Arterial blood sampling was obtained on room air, and showed hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mmHg). The patient also had compensatory polycythemia (hemoglobin 15.8 g/dl) secondary to chronic hypoxemia. The last cardiac catheterization was performed when the patient was 12 years old, and it showed only mild atrio-ventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR). The mean pressure of the Fontan pathway was 13 mmHg. Laboratory testing revealed increased serum (3,533 pg/ml; normal < 1,050 pg/ml) and urine (768.2 µg/day; normal < 97 µg/day) norepinephrine and urine vanillylmandelic acid (8.8 mg/day; normal 2-7 mg/day) levels. Computed tomography showed a 4 cm mass in the left para-aortic area above the left kidney. With an impression of pheochromocytoma, the patient was scheduled for laparoscopic excision of the tumor. Phenoxybenzamine (10 mg) was administered daily for 2 weeks before the surgery. Preoperative electrocardiography showed supraventricular tachycardia and 24 h Holter monitoring showed no significant cardiac arrhythmia except intermittent junctional rhythm. Echocardiography revealed mild AVVR. The estimated ejection fraction of the ventricle was approximately 50% and the ventricular wall motion was normal. There was no obvious stenosis within the Fontan pathway or the scanned parts of pulmonary vessels.
After being administered intravenous midazolam (1.5 mg), the patient was brought to the operating room. The initial SBP and HR there were 144 mmHg and 94 beats/min, respectively. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam (2.5 mg), etomidate (10 mg), remifentanil (40 µg), and rocuronium (50 mg). The trachea was intubated and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and 50% oxygen in 2 L/min fresh gas. In addition, intravenous remifentanil was infused continuously during the surgery. The right radial artery was cannulated for continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. A central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and continuous central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring was started. The initial CVP was 15 mmHg. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted smoothly and the echocardiographic evaluation revealed normal ventricular function with mild AVVR. After achieving hemodynamic stability, a continuous infusion of milrinone (0.5 µg/kg/min) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) (1 g/h) was started after a 1-g loading dose of MgSO4 to prevent severe pulmonary hypertension and maintain a stable blood pressure during the surgery.
Surgery was started, and intra-abdominal CO2 insufflation was begun for the laparoscopic procedure. After insufflation, the CVP was increased to 28 mmHg and the SBP rose from 90 to 128 mmHg (). Simultaneously, the peak inspiratory pressure increased from 17 to 24 cmH2O. The arterial oxygen saturation decreased from 100 to 97%, and the arterial oxygen partial pressure dropped from 196 to 93 mmHg. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was maintained between 13 and 15 mmHg. The inspired oxygen fraction was transiently set to 1.0, and an immediate TEE evaluation showed preserved ventricular contractility without aggravation of the mild AVVR. To prevent abrupt arterial hypertension, a continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was started (0.5 µg/kg/min) and titrated up to 1.5 µg/kg/min. However, four further sudden increases in SBP over 160 mmHg, up to 194 mmHg, occurred during the dissection and approach to the tumor; these were controlled by intravenous bolus injections of SNP (30 or 40 µg) and remifentanil (40 or 50 µg). No significant cardiac arrhythmias were detected, except sinus tachycardia during the dissection.
Approximately 2 h after establishing pneumoperitoneum, the surgeon decided to convert from laparoscopic surgery to a laparotomy, suspecting aortic invasion of the tumor. After exsufflation, the CVP decreased from 18 to 10 mmHg and the SBP dropped from 120 to 70 mmHg. Subsequent TEE showed decreased ventricular volume with preserved contractility. After fluid resuscitation and continuous infusion of dopamine (5 µg/kg/min) and norepinephrine (0.02 µg/kg/min) for approximately 7 min, the SBP recovered and was maintained at 100-120 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that the oxygen partial pressure had increased to 157 mmHg. Subsequently, there were several abrupt increases in SBP up to 190 mmHg until the tumor was excised; these were well controlled with bolus injections of SNP and remifentanil.
The tumor was removed approximately 260 min after beginning the surgery. After removing the tumor, the MgSO4 was discontinued and the milrinone was tapered (0.25 µg/kg/min). Continuous infusion of dopamine (5 µg/kg/min) and norepinephrine (0.04 µg/kg/min) was initiated. The infusion rates were tapered to 3 and 0.02 µg/kg/min, respectively, before the end of surgery. The duration of the surgery and anesthesia was 490 min. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and extubated 12 h later. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl was used to manage postoperative pain, which was relatively well controlled. All inotropics were discontinued on the third postoperative day. Subsequently, the patient was moved to a general ward and discharged uneventfully on the 13th postoperative day.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",65.937,62.64,69.234,"The patient's gender is Male.

Three days prior to admission, an episode of less severe but similar symptoms was reported. The patient appeared clinically stable on physical examination, and vital signs were reported as a blood pressure of 135/75 mmHg, pulse 121 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94%, respiratory rate 20 per minute, and central body temperature of 37.4°C.
The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 147 beats per minute and an episode of non-sustained, monomorphic VT. Consequently, the patient was transferred to the department of cardiology for ECG-monitoring and further evaluation. An ECG () confirmed the presence of sinus tachycardia and non-sustained VT, and an echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Initial blood tests, including electrolytes and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were within the reference range. Due to multiple paroxysms of non-sustained monomorphic VT (), the patient was given a 300 mg bolus of amiodarone intravenously over 20 minutes, which rapidly led to stabilization of the heart rhythm. The VT resolved completely within three hours.
The patient did not take any prescription drugs. However, he was taking one capsule of weight loss pills daily, initiated one week prior to admission. He had purchased the product, which contains ephedrine, caffeine, and aspirin, on the internet. Since no other risk factors for VT were present, these capsules were the most likely cause of arrhythmia.
The patient was monitored for another 24 hours without recurring episodes of VT. The corrected QT-interval (QTc) was normal during the entire admission, and hs-cTnT values remained within the reference range during serial measurements.

He was diagnosed with bilateral CLP and mandibular prognathism associated with midface deficiency, and was scheduled to undergo LeFort I osteotomy, right iliac block bone graft procedure, and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. He had previously undergone cheiloplasty, palatoplasty, cleft maxillary repair, and pharyngoplasty to correct the CLP. Preoperative laboratory findings, chest X-ray image, and electrocardiogram were normal. He had no other diseases, including upper airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.
He had maxillary deficiency with malocclusion, mandibular prognathism, a scar due to a pharyngeal flap, and cheiloplasty. As a premedication, glycopyrolate (0.2 mg) was injected intramuscularly. Standard monitoring was performed in the operating room. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (1 µg/kg), propofol (120 mg), and rocuronium (50 mg). After providing adequate muscle relaxation, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FFB)-guided NTI was attempted using a nasotracheal tube (NTT) of 6.5 mm internal diameter; this procedure was performed instead of a direct rigid laryngoscope because FFB technique and smaller sized NTT are more suitable for adults who have intact pharyngeal flaps. The FFB was inserted into the both nostrils for examination and passed through the posterior pharynx; we observed that the velopharyngeal port (between the nasopharynx and oropharynx) was divided into two small-sized pharyngeal ports by the pharyngeal flap (). Because right side of pharyngeal port was a little wider, a scope was passed carefully through the right side pharyngeal port and vocal cords to the carina; NTT was passed over the FFB smoothly. There was no specific resistance during NTT insertion, but minor bleeding appeared on the nasopharynx. After the intubation, the patient was mechanically ventilated to administer desflurane (6 vol%), with a fresh gas flow rate of 3 L/min and 50% oxygen in air. After the induction of anesthesia, active bleeding was observed in the mouth immediately. To assess the bleeding focus, we examined the oral cavity with a dental mirror, and bleeding was seen at the pharyngeal flap. The flap was probably torn at the time of the NTI. Subsequently, hemostasis was achieved using a 4 × 4 gauze moistened with 1:1000 epinephrine solution. After the bleeding was controlled, cotton swabs soaked in 2% lidocaine and 1:1000 epinephrine were inserted into the torn flap and nostril. Subsequently, the pharyngeal bleeding stopped, and the surgery was completed without further complications. After the surgery, the patient recovered without any problems. A follow-up examination using a nasendoscopic view that was performed two years later showed that the pharyngeal flap remained intact after the recovery (). For this case presentation, we received consent from the patient.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [60.0, 'kg']}",100.0,95.0,105.0,"The patient's weight is 60.0 kg.

He had a four-day history of flu with cough and fever (39.4°C), having recently complained of dyspnea and progressive edema of the lower extremities. Physical examination revealed hypotension (blood pressure, 80/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (140 bpm). Auscultation of the thorax showed decreased breath sounds in the right lung and crackles in the left lung base. At admission, a chest X-ray revealed right pleural effusion and a CT scan showed right pleural effusion with collapse of the right lower and middle lobes associated with extensive effusion. Laboratory tests at admission revealed a white blood cell count of 30.2 × 109 cells/L (92% neutrophils and 3.6% lymphocytes), a platelet count of 956 × 109/L, a serum C-reactive protein level of 15.84 mg/dL, a serum creatinine concentration of 1.32 mg/dL, a serum sodium level of 135 mEq/L, and a serum potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L.
A chest X-ray performed on the second day of hospitalization showed progression of the disease process: an opacity involving nearly all of the right lung and further enlargement of cardiopericardial silhouette ( A). Echocardiography showed severe pericardial effusion affecting the entire cardiac silhouette. Pericardiocentesis yielded 640 mL of exudative fluid, the culture of which was negative. Pericardial and thoracic drainage was performed; purulent fluid was obtained in a sterile manner from the chest drain. Examination of the pleural fluid showed a pH of 6.95, a glucose level of 5 mg/dL, proteins at 47.4 g/L, and an LDH content of 5,347 U/L. A second chest X-ray showed consolidation in the right lung, minimal pleural fluid, and a normal cardiac silhouette ( B). A urinary pneumococcal antigen test was negative. Pleural fluid culture was positive for S. pneumoniae that was susceptible to erythromycin, levofloxacin, and penicillin. The isolate was S. pneumoniae serotype 1.
The patient received empirical antibiotic treatment with the piperacillin-tazobactam combination (4.5 g/8 h) and levofloxacin (500 mg twice a day for 5 days). The latter was continued because the pneumococcus was susceptible to it. The patient was discharged on the twelfth day, after withdrawal of the pericardial and pleural drains.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [53, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.32, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",64.497,61.272,67.722,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

The pain started suddenly after she lifted a typewriter weighing 60 pounds. The pain was throbbing in nature, 5/10 in intensity, radiating to both arms, worsened with any movement, and lasted for several hours. She was taking over-the-counter tylenol with minimal improvement in the pain. She came to the ED as the pain persisted. On arrival, she rated her pain as severe. She was vitally stable and general physical exam was benign. Routine laboratory workup and troponin were within normal limits. She was suspected to have muscle spasm of the back and was treated with stat doses of ketorolac 30 mg intramuscularly, cyclobenzaprine 10 mg orally as well as a lidocaine transdermal patch. She reported improvement in her back pain and was discharged on cyclobenzaprine 10 mg orally three times a day for seven days. After reaching home she started having the back pain again without any improvement with muscle relaxant (cyclobenzaprine). She also reported having a new onset of nausea and one episode of vomiting. However, she did not have a fever, cough, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath. She came to the ED for further evaluation. On detailed discussion, she reported that her father and grandfather had MI in their fifties, and mother died at the age of 24 during childbirth due to unknown reasons.
On physical examination, the patient appeared anxious. The temperature was 36.7°C (normal = 36.5°C-37.3°C), pulse 121 beats per minute (normal = 60-100 beats per minute), blood pressure 140/93 mmHg ( normal < 120/80 mmHg), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (normal = 12-18 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 96% (normal = 95%-100%) while she was breathing ambient air. The body mass index (BMI) was 34.6 kg/m² (weight: 96.4 kg, height: 1.67 m). There was mild tenderness in the thoracic spine at the T1-T3 level. The remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. Differential diagnosis included musculoskeletal pain, infectious process (spinal epidural abscess/pericarditis), aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and MI.
The details of lab work investigations are shown in Table .
Blood culture was negative for any growth. Urine drug screening for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, opiates, oxycodone, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene was negative.
CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm or dissection, and contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thoracic spine was negative for epidural abscess, fracture, or malalignment. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was initially normal (Figure ).
Repeat EKG the next day showed sinus tachycardia, and Q-wave in lead III, and V1-V3 (Figure ).
Echocardiogram showed hypokinesis of the left ventricular mid to apical, anterior septum, apical cap, and inferior apical wall.
A provisional diagnosis of acute MI was formulated based on ongoing chest pain, dynamic EKG changes, rising troponin I on serial monitoring, and echocardiographic findings. The patient was started on a heparin drip and was medically managed with aspirin 325 mg orally, metoprolol 25 mg orally, and sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg. The patient was transferred immediately to the cardiac catheterization lab for left heart catheterization with angiography. Coronary angiography showed 99% ostial left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis, mild luminal irregularities in the left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery (RCA) dominance. There was no stenosis noted in the left main artery and RCA (Figure ).

Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (65.748 (in inches) - 60) = 58.72 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 58.72 kg.The patient's weight is 96.4 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 58.72 kg + 0.4 * (96.4 kg  - 58.72 kg) = 73.792 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 73.792 kg."

The patient had suffered from atrial fibrillation for the last 2 yr. Her medications for the previous 2 yr included diltiazem 90 mg, metoprorol 25 mg, and aspirin 100 mg twice a day. In addition, she had been taking mirtazapine 30 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg daily for a 6 yr history of dysthymia.
Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 100/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a normal body temperature. Her body weight was 62.3 kg, and she was 158 cm in height. Initial laboratory results were unremarkable with a normal PT of 12.3 sec (INR 1.0). Routine chemical studies indicated normal values for total protein (6.6 g/dL), albumin (3.9 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (17 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (10 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (79 U/L), total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL) blood urea nitrogen (16.4 mg/dL), creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Results of hematological studies including complete blood counts were also normal. Mild cardiomegaly was found on the chest radiography. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation and left atrial enlargement (45 mm).
The patient underwent heparinization with an initial bolus administration of 3,600 IU heparin followed by continuous infusion for 6 days. Then the patient was started on 2 or 3 mg of warfarin daily (16.3 mg/week) to prevent thromboembolism, and was discharged after 3 days with a PT of 37.4 sec (INR 2.81). When she revisited the outpatient clinic after 3 days, her PT was found to be 50.0 sec (INR 3.68). After normalization of the patient's PT with warfarin withdrawal for 3 days, 1 or 2 mg/day (10.5 mg/week) of warfarin was prescribed. The PT after 3 days of treatment was 41.6 sec (INR 3.11). The administration of warfarin dose was changed (6.5-10.5 mg/week) continuously, which resulted in a PT of 20.9-43.1 sec (INR 1.64-3.21). She had to discontinue warfarin therapy temporarily 3 times. The difficulty in finding the optimal treatment dose during the induction period of anticoagulation continued for more than 2 month.
The patient continues to receive warfarin therapy at the outpatient clinic monthly and her PT remains within the recommended target therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), even though her warfarin dose has been reduced to 6.5 mg/week.
The patient was genotyped for CYP2C9 after informed consent. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and all 9 exons of the CYP2C9 gene were amplified by PCR (-). The PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISIM BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).

The patient developed nonbloody, large-volume diarrhea after eating take-out 11 days ago, with four to five bowel movements per day. During this time, she also experienced fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, general malaise, and weakness. In addition, she observed leaking and drainage around her G-tube site with associated erythema and intense abdominal pain. The patient denied sick contacts or recent travel.
Her past medical history includes obesity, orthostatic hypotension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, gastrojejunal ulcer, Kawasaki’s disease, subdural hemorrhage, epilepsy, chronic pain syndrome, and anxiety. The patient’s past surgical history includes burr-hole craniotomy, lithotripsy, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by chronic refractory marginal ulceration and small bowel obstruction requiring two resections, ventral hernia repair, and gastrostomy tube insertion.
The patient was pregnant six times and had six miscarriages (G6P0060). She lives with her husband and adopted son with good social support. She is currently unemployed. The patient denies ever smoking and does not drink alcohol. Familial history consists of diabetes, heart disease, and nephrolithiasis in the patient’s mother. Her father had glaucoma, nephrolithiasis, and prostate cancer.
Medications before admission included pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day, sucralfate 1 g twice a day, ondansetron 4 mg twice a day as needed for nausea, midodrine 10 mg three times a day, fludrocortisone 0.1 mg twice a day, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, levetiracetam 1500 twice a day, methadone 10 mg every 8 hours, and lorazepam 0.5 mg daily as needed for anxiety. She was also on daily vitamin A, D3, and B-complex supplements and a monthly cyanocobalamin 1000 μg intramuscular injection, in addition to a nutritional supplement Isosource 1.5 Cal that is administered through the G-tube once every night.
Due to her complex past surgical history, the patient was sent from her local emergency department to our hospital. At presentation, the patient was febrile to 101 ℉. Blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats per minute. Further examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with erythema and purulent drainage around the G-tube site on the left upper quadrant. The general examination showed a thin patient who is alert and oriented. Mucous membranes were moist. Lungs were clear to auscultation as she was breathing comfortably on room air. Heart sounds were regular without murmurs. Extremities were warm with intact pulses bilaterally and no edema. However, she had moderate muscle loss for her age. Skin was intact except for the previously mentioned erythema around the G-tube. Neurological examination revealed normal speech with comprehension, intact cranial nerves II–VII, XI, and XII, and 5/5 motor strength in all four extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick throughout. Romberg test was negative. Gait was slowed owing to weakness but showed normal balance.
Serum chemistry showed sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 2.9 mmol/L, chloride of 111 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 6.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 13 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 21 U/L. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.97 × 109 /L, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.6%, and platelet count of 239 × 109 /L. Urinalysis showed normal appearance and color, specific gravity of 1.020, without detecting red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), ketones, glucose, leukocytes esterase, or nitrites. A stool sample was sent for Clostridium difficile and a molecular enteric panel but was pending at that time. Two out of two blood cultures that were collected at her local emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods. An abdominal radiograph confirmed G-tube location overlying the stomach and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed nonspecific skin thickening and subcutaneous fat stranding along the G-tube insertion site (Fig. ). Due to a prior history of penicillin and sulfa anaphylactic reactions, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 hours for bacteremia, and oral clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for the cellulitis surrounding her G-tube site, in addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 75 mL/hour and electrolyte repletion with oral potassium chloride 20 mEq for four total doses, and intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g once.
A fluoroscopy G-tube study revealed no contrast leak or evidence of obstruction. On day 1 of hospitalization, the molecular enteric stool panel was positive for the Salmonella species. On day 4, two out of two blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis with susceptibilities to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous ciprofloxacin to a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. We resumed tube feeds through the G-tube on day 5 after a successful clamping trial. On day 6, the patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse, with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Vital signs remained within normal limits; T max of 98.6 ℉, blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Laboratory results were significant for a serum creatinine level of 5.25 mg/dL and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 105 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L. These clinical and laboratory findings of dehydration suggested the development of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of prolonged GI volume loss. The patient was resuscitated with half normal saline containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate additive at 125 mL/hour. On day 8, the patient’s mental status improved but her G-tube began to leak, prompting clamping of the G-tube. The patient was encouraged to increase oral intake. Intravenous fluids were discontinued on day 9, as she was able to tolerate oral foods and liquids well. No further leakage was seen around her G-tube site. On day 13, the patient was discharged home with a peripherally inserted central line to finish a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours).
Following completion of a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient made a full recovery with resolution of her diarrhea and abdominal pain. Tube feeds were resumed without further issues. At a 4-month follow-up visit with her bariatric surgeon, the patient reports that she is doing well and happy with her progress. Electrolytes and serum creatinine were all within normal limits. The patient was readmitted 6 months following her initial hospitalization for abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a large marginal ulcer. She improved with conservative measures including bowel rest (nothing per os) and maintenance intravenous fluids, and was discharged 2 days later. At the time of discharge, her hemoglobin remained stable at 11.2 g/dL, and she was able to tolerate an oral diet.

The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 111.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 111.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 111.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 111.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 111.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 111.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 20.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 20.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 20.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 20.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 20.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 20.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (111.0 mEq/L + 20.0 mEq/L) = 5.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 5.0 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 2.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 5.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.5 (in g/dL)) = 8.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 8.75 mEq/L.
Plugging in 8.75 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 8.75 - 12 = -3.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -3.25 mEq/L."

Birth weight was 2.6 kg. Physical examination revealed a chubby boy with moon face and protruding abdomen (). Increased body hair, striae, and other stigmata of MAS such as café-au-lait spots were absent. An unexpected finding was an abnormally large phallus with coarse pubic hair (). On enquiry, the parents gave no history of steroid intake. His IQ scores were appropriate for his age and there was no history of voice change, and his sibling was in good health. The patient's body length was 92 cm (<3rd percentile; standard deviation score (SDS) −6.5) and his weight was 29 kg (80th percentile; SDS +1.6).
Blood pressure was 220/140 mmHg. Biochemical evaluation revealed a cortisol level of 25.80 μg/dL with a concurrent plasma ACTH level of 10.0 pg/mL (within normal limits). His serum cortisol following high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) (0.25 mg of dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours (20 μg/kg/dose)) was 20.38 μg/dL and fasting blood sugar was 110 mg/dL ().
Ultrasonography revealed a left suprarenal mass with parenchymal disease of kidneys.

He had presented with the symptoms of progressive loss of hearing and imbalance while walking.
He gave a history of a cough with expectoration and recurrent lung infections since childhood and was evaluated for tuberculosis and found to be negative. During this admission, he had a cough but he could not bring out the sputum. Since there were no signs of active lung infection, we did not perform a bronchoscopy to evaluate cause for bronchiectasis. He is a hypertensive for 20 years on treatment with amlodipine 5 mg once daily. On examination, he had extensive crepitation over the right hemithorax, and tracheal shift to the right. His magnetic resonance imaging brain (T2-weighted image), showed a large vestibular schwannoma (5.2 cm × 4.3 cm × 3.5 cm in size) with obstructive hydrocephalus []. His chest X-ray findings showed right-sided bronchiectasis and fibrosis with the gross mediastinal shift []. Spirometry revealed a moderate obstructive pulmonary disease. Preoperative arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) on room air showed compensated respiratory acidosis with the pH of 7.43, PaO2 of 74 mmHg and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg with HCO3 of 31 mmHg. An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with normal LV systolic function, and there was no pulmonary hypertension.
In view of severe bronchiectasis and long duration surgery in the left lateral position (diseased side of the lung being up), decided to isolate the right lung using right-sided double lumen tube (RDLT). In this case, we chose to put a RDLT because of the following reasons.
The angle between bronchus and trachea was obliterated because of lung fibrosis with the mediastinal shift. Right bronchus was almost in a straight line with the trachea []. Hence, placement of RDLT will be easy when compared to the left. With a left DLT, secretion from the right lung can get accumulated above the left bronchial cuff. The presence of low pressure cuff cannot provide a tight seal against spillage. Hence, we felt that presence of RDLT will give better protection than the left DLT.
In the operating theater, standard monitors including electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive blood pressure were connected. His room air saturation was 94%. Modified rapid sequence induction was done using 2 μg/kg of fentanyl and 2 mg/kg of propofol, and was then paralyzed with 1.0 mg/kg of rocuronium and intubated with 39F RDLT. Mallinckdrodt™ the tube position was confirmed by fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB). Both the lungs were suctioned separately before placing the patient in the left lateral position. After positioning, the head was fixed using Mayfield head clamp, repeat FOB was done to confirm the lung isolation. Copious thick purulent secretion was suctioned out from the right lung. To assess the contribution of the right lung on CO2 elimination split lung ventilation was performed by ventilating only diseased lung (right side). There was a significant ETCO2 value noted (20 mmHg) while ventilating the right lung, we have decided ventilate both lungs. The patient was ventilated with pressure controlled ventilation using lung protective ventilation strategies. The end-tidal CO2 was maintained between 35 and 37 mm of Hg.
Intraoperatively, anesthesia was maintained using air, oxygen (FiO20.6) and isoflurane, and vecuronium infusion. Intermittent bolus doses of fentanyl and intravenous paracetamol were given for analgesia. Serial ABG's were taken to ensure the adequacy of ventilation. PaCO2 was maintained between 40 and 45 mmHg (baseline value was 49 mmHg). Vitals were stable throughout the surgery. Brain relaxation was reported adequate during the surgery.
The surgery lasted for 6 h. At the end of surgery, bilateral endobronchial suctioning was done in the lateral position. An intravenous lignocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was given to prevent coughing before placing the patient in supine oblique (left side up). Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg). The trachea was extubated when the patient was fully awake. The patient was shifted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in the right lateral position. His postoperative chest X-ray showed clear lung field on the left side [].

Her respiratory rate was 20 cycles per minute and oxygen saturation was 97% on air. She had right-sided lower motor type facial nerve palsy. Glasgow Coma Scale was 13/15. The rest of the neurological examination including other cranial nerves and ophthalmoscope examination was unremarkable.
Our initial working diagnosis was leptospirosis with acute kidney injury and treatment was initiated accordingly (intravenously administered antibiotic and hemodialysis via femoral vascular catheter), but we could not explain the cranial nerve involvement. The following day she came out with the history of a suicide attempt in which she had self-ingested brake oil (amount not clear) after a conflict with her husband.
On admission her renal functions were deranged with serum creatinine of 352 μmol/ L, blood urea of 14.1 mmol/l, Na+ 140 mmol/l, and K 5.2 mmol/l. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.08, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 94, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 28, bicarbonate (HCO3) 13.8, and base excess − 18 mEq per liter. Her serum osmolality was 339 mosmols with an osmolar gap of 20 mOsm/kg and anion gap was 32 mEq/l. Although relevant, her urine was not examined for calcium oxalate crystals. Full blood count showed hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dl, platelet of 185 × 106/L, and white cell count of 15.2 × 106/L. Her C-reactive protein was 22 mg/dl. Her random blood sugar was 92 mg/dl. Her blood and urine cultures were negative. Her pro-calcitonin levels were within normal range. A chest X-ray did not reveal any abnormality such as consolidation or pleural effusion. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of her brain was normal. Leptospira antibody tested after 10 days of disease was negative. She was started on initial consecutive daily dialysis followed by every other day dialysis which yielded a considerable improvement in renal functions. After 10 days of hospital stay she was discharged with residual facial nerve palsy. Over the course of 3 months’ clinic follow-up she had complete renal and neurological improvement.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [92.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [140.0, 'mmol/L']}",139.808,132.818,146.798,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 92.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (92.0 - 100) = 139.808 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.808 mEq/L."

2689,7,Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-4655285-1,Extracted,"An 83-year-old woman visits our hospital with complaint of a one-week history of worsening lower back pain. She felt lower back pain 3 months ago, occasionally radiating along right leg. She had taken medication for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia for several years. She underwent abdominal ultrasonography in our hospital 8 and 3 years ago, and she was suspected to have mild and moderate fatty liver, respectively. She denied alcohol drinking and cigarettes smoking for her entire life. Her family history was uneventful. She admitted for further evaluation.
On admission, her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. Height and body weight were 149 cm and 47.3 kg, respectively. Body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. In physical examination, there was direct tenderness on sternum, right ribs, and thoracic and lumbar spine. Hypoesthesia on L4/5 dermatome was noted. At left occiput, a 3 cm-sized, fixed, and round mass was palpated without tenderness. She said that it seemed to be felt about 3 months ago. Breath sound was clear without adventitious sound, and heart beat was regular without murmur. There were no abnormal findings in abdomen. There was no palpable lymph node. The remaining examinations are unremarkable.
In laboratory examinations, total leukocyte count was 7,440/mm3, the level of hemoglobin was 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count was 245,000/mm3. In chemistry battery, creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, uric acid was 5.5 mg/dL, total protein was 7.0 g/dL, albumin was 3.9 g/dL, AST was 38 IU/L, AST was 26 IU/L, total bilirubin was 0.2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase was 135 IU/L, and serum total calcium was 9.0 mg/dL. In lipid battery, total cholesterol was 130 mg/dL, triglyceride was 75 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol was 40 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol was 82 mg/dL, and HbA1c was 6.2%. In serologic test, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis C antibody were negative; and hepatitis B surface antibody was positive. Serology for HIV and syphilis were negative.
In whole spine magnetic resonance image (MRI), 3 cm-sized metastatic lesions were revealed in T12 and L5 body to right pedicle, respectively. Also, small nodular lesions at T3, 9, 10, and 3 cm-sized occipital lesion were observed. To find primary cancer, chest computed tomography (chest CT) and abdominopelvic CT (AP-CT) were performed. In chest CT, multiple bone metastases were shown in sternum, right clavicle, right 11th rib, and thoracic spines. However, there was no abnormal finding to suspect primary cancer. In AP-CT, small round nodule was observed in liver segment 8, which was measured by 2.5 cm, showing faint arterial enhancement and delayed washout (). Also, moderate degree of fatty liver was suspected concordantly with her previous findings in ultrasonography. However, there were no features of cirrhosis such as surface nodularity, ascites, or splenomegaly. Also, there was right ovarian cystic tumor without mural nodules or calcification. It was measured by 3 cm compared to 1.4 cm 8 years ago. Liver MRI and α-fetoprotein (AFP) were checked due to the typical enhancing pattern observed in AP-CT. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) also was checked due to right ovarian cystic tumor despite the fact that it did not show hot-uptake in PET-CT. In liver MRI, hepatic mass (<3 cm) showed low signal intensity on T1WI, high signal intensity on T2WI, diffusion restriction positive, arterial enhancement, delay washout, and defect on hepatobiliary phase in segment 8 (). The level of AFP was elevated to 12230 ng/mL, and the level of CA-125 was in normal range. HCC was identified; however, it was a small solitary HCC with T2 intrahepatic stage in modified International Union Against Cancer (UICC) staging system. There was no other intrahepatic metastasis. Because the liver lesion or ovarian lesion was too small to conclude it as the primary cancer of the disseminated bone metastases, further evaluation with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was planned. PET-CT image showed fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) hot-uptakes in hepatic segment 8 (max standardized uptake value: 3.7), multiple bone metastases at right scapula, sternum, cervix—thoracic—lumbar vertebrae, bilateral ribs, left occipital bone, and right mandible. However, no other abnormal 18F-FDG uptakes were shown except liver and bone lesions. No lung metastasis and lymph node metastasis were suspected.
Because it is very unusual clinical finding that the diffuse and extensive musculoskeletal metastases were derived from small solitary HCC or ovarian cystic mass, we planned tissue biopsy at bone metastatic site to confirm the primary cancer. Brain MRI was taken to biopsy at occipital mass; brain MRI showed lobulating, enhancing skull mass in left occiput (3.5 × 2.5 cm), with destruction of bone and intracranial extension (). Incisional biopsy from occiput mass was done, and it revealed metastatic HCC with Edmondson Steiner grade 4/4 (). Finally, HCC with multiple bone metastases, modified UICC T2N0M1, IV-B stage was diagnosed. The patient needs two times of resuture due to the wound dehiscence at the incision site.
After diagnosis, the cause of HCC was searched again. However, antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody were all negative findings. Immunoglobulin G was in normal range (1461 mg/dL), serum ceruloplasmin was 32.7 mg/dL, and ferritin was 79.24 ng/mL. Although there was a suspicion of fatty liver and associated NAFLD, we did not perform liver biopsy because the patient would not have additional benefit from it.
With regard to the advanced stage and patient's poor performance status, conservative treatment with radiation therapy on L5 (39 Gy in 13 fractions) was done. After 1 month from the completion of radiotherapy, she complained of right chest pain and increased occipital mass, additional radiotherapy on metastatic lesion of left occiput and right 11th rib was done. After 3 months from then, PET-CT was reevaluated due to the aggravating lower back pain. Although there was little change in primary cancer in hepatic segment 8, the previous bone metastases were aggravated significantly and multiple new bone metastatic lesions were developed. She wanted supportive care and was transferred to hospice.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The pregnancy was complicated by twin gestation diagnosed at 7 weeks, and gestational diabetes in the last month of pregnancy, which was controlled by diet. Delivery by repeat Caesarean section at 35 ½ weeks of secondary to prior uterine surgery for an ectopic pregnancy.
The neonatal period was unremarkable. At two and a half months he had an incarcerated left inguinal hernia that was repaired surgically. He has had a history of clinical seizures since the age of 15 months controlled by medication including topiramate, clonazepam, and sodium valproate.
On examination at 8.4 years his height was 127.3 cm (50%), weight 25.9 kg (50%), and head circumference 52.5 cm (50%). Physical findings included brachycephaly, mid-facial retrusion, prognathism, macrostomia, wide-spaced teeth, tongue thrusting and strabismus. General examination of heart, lungs, and abdomen was unremarkable. On neurological exam, cranial nerves were grossly intact. His motor examination was notable for truncal hypotonia and increased tone in all extremities. He had jerky movements and a wide-based gait with his arms held in flexion when walking. His EEG at age 8 years was abnormal with widespread delta slowing maximal posteriorly at the fully alert state but dominant frontally in addition to delta, notched delta blunted spike waves or frank spike waves were seen of which one was associated with a clinical event (grunting).
Twin B had mild respiratory distress at birth and was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for 10 days for antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. He began to have seizures at 15 months of age, during which he would tighten his jaw, make growling noises, and have rhythmic tremors. His seizures were controlled by medication EEG obtained at 8 years was suggestive of an active seizure disorder, very characteristic of Angelman syndrome with widespread posterior discharges consisting of delta, notched delta and spike waves. On examination at 8 y. and 5 mo., his height was 128.2 cm (50%), weight 26 kg (50%) and head circumference 53 cm (50-75%). Craniofacial features were identical to his twin. Unlike his twin, he aexhibited mild scoliosis. Both twins were diagnosed with Angelman syndrome at 16 months of age through FISH testing with probes from D15S11 and GABRB3 that showed a typical Angelman syndrome Class I deletion at chromosome 15. DNA methylation studies were conducted and concluded to be diagnostic of AS.
Twins C and D were born to a 29 year old G2 P0 mother and 34 year old father. The pregnancy was naturally conceived and a routine ultrasound at 16 weeks gestation revealed monoamniotic monochorionic twins. There were no exposures during the pregnancy. An ultrasound disclosed no problems. The pregnancy was complicated by preterm contractions beginning at 29 weeks, treated with bedrest and terbutaline, and HELLP syndrome, treated with MgSO4. At 34 weeks gestation, rupture of membranes occurred, and induction of labor was undertaken. Twin D was born vaginally, but twin C was delivered by emergency caesarean section due to cord prolapse.
Both twins had severe muscle hypotonia that persisted beyond a year of age and were diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome based on FISH at 13 months. Breast feeding was not successful due to a weak suck and they were fed breast milk in a bottle with a preemie nipple for 1 month and then transitioned to formula. Their coloring was lighter than expected for the family. At 2 years of age, the diagnosis was changed to Angelman syndrome based on DNA methylation results. Twin C was examined at 5 years and 8 months and twin D was examined at 7 years of age. Their chromosome 15q11-q13 deletion associated with Angelman syndrome was characterized as a Class I deletion.
Twin C weighed 2.15 kg, measured 47 cm, and had Apgar scores of 4 and 7. He stayed for 9 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for temperature regulation and feeding issues. He had febrile seizures in association with a respiratory infection at age 4 months, and non-febrile convulsions began at age 28 months. He had several episodes of status epilepticus and failed management with 6 anti-epileptic medications. Severe failure to thrive necessitated percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement at 3 years of age. When evaluated at age 5 years 8 months, he weighed 16 kg (12%), measured 112 cm (70%), and had a head circumference of 49 cm (75%). He had microbrachycephaly with an occipital ridge, exotropia, midface retrusion, prognathism, and macrostomia with widely spaced teeth. He had a moderate rightward thoracic and leftward lumbar scoliosis and pronated ankles. He had generalized muscle hypotonia.
Twin D weighed 2.13 kg, measured 47 cm, and had Apgar scores of 4 and 7. He was gavage fed for 3 days and discharged home at 9 days. Exotropia and sleep disturbance were noted from infancy. Food refusal and severe failure to thrive necessitated percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement at 3 years of age. There were multiple episodes of otitis media and pneumonia, the latter presumed due to aspiration. Gagging and gastroesophageal reflux disease resulted in many episodes of emesis per day.
Seizures with fever began at 4 months, and afebrile seizures started at 28 months of age. Nearly all developmental skills were lost until seizure control was achieved approximately several months later, following which skills were regained slowly. On examination at 7 years of age, he weighed 19.5 kg (10%), measured 119.3 cm (30%) and had a head circumference of 49.4 cm (50%). He had alternating exotropia, midface retrusion, prognathism, widely spaced teeth, and mild rightward thoracic and leftward lumbar scoliosis.

Besides the injured thigh, there was no complaint of pain at any other site. There was no associated injury and any other comorbid conditions. The patient was obese with a body mass index of 37 and no other comorbidities. He had no history of veno-occlusive disease, and all the preoperative laboratory evaluations were normal. Antegrade interlocking nailing was planned as a treatment strategy. He was taken into the operating theatre within 48 h of the trauma after adequate resuscitation. The surgery was carried out under general anaesthesia, with epidural analgesia. The patient was positioned on a fracture table. The well leg was placed in hemilithotomy position in 70° flexion and 40° abduction, and it was placed on a leg holder. The patient was maintained in this position throughout the procedure. Following closed reduction of the fracture, nailing was attempted. But the failure to obtain acceptable reduction initially increased the surgical time; the intraoperative plan was changed and fixation with a dynamic condylar screw (DCS) was performed (fig. ). The total surgical time was 2 h and 30 min. There was 650 ml of blood loss and 1 unit of whole blood was transfused intraoperatively. The patient's arterial blood pressure was maintained by the anaesthetists at 94/60 mm Hg or above throughout the procedure as a preventive measure to reduce bleeding at the operative site. The intraoperative traction was released after 2 h for 5 min. When the procedure was nearing completion, a dose of epidural analgesia was given to relieve the patient of any possible postoperative pain. The patient was shifted to the ward after the completion of surgery.
In the postoperative rounds, the distal pulses of the operated extremity were palpable and any neural deficit could not be assessed as the patient was under the effect of epidural analgesia. The well leg was not examined by the surgeon and the nurse. Four hours after the end of surgery, the patient complained of severe pain in the well leg. A tense and firm swelling was found and stretch pain was present (fig. ). On physical examination, there was paraesthesia on the lateral aspect of the foot. A diagnosis of well-leg compartment syndrome was made. An urgent radiograph of the well leg was taken to exclude any bone injury which might have been missed. The radiographs revealed no bone injury, and the patient was treated with an immediate fasciotomy. A double-incision fasciotomy was performed. Vacuum-assisted closure suction was applied over the fasciotomy wound (fig. ). His wounds healed without difficulty and he regained normal strength and sensation in the lower extremity. The patient was discharged on the 20th postoperative day. The fracture united both clinically and radiologically at the 12th week.

The patient was non-smoking, non-drinking and with a free medical history. She weighed 61 kg and had a height of 162 cm.
The patient had already visited two physicians. The first assessment was made at the day of the injury at a hospital elsewhere. This first clinical examination revealed pain at the cervical spine and deficiency in the range of the cervical spine motion but no neurologic impairment was present. No radiologic examination was ordered and the patient received analgesics and recommendation for physiotherapy sessions. Persistence of pain led to a second assessment by another physician one week later at another hospital. Analgesics were once more prescribed and radiological screening was once more not considered essential.
On examination in our department, the patient showed no neurologic deficit, whereas restriction of range of motion and pain remained. Three-view radiographs (lateral, anteroposterior and odondoid) ordered by the attending emergency physician showed bilateral C5-C6 dislocation causing instability (Figure ). CT and MRI scan showed olisthesis of C5 over C6, anterior angulation and narrowing of the spinal canal without spinal cord pressure from disc material (Figure ). The electrophysiological testing was normal.
The patient was transferred to the operating theatre at the day of the admission. Open reduction of the bilateral dislocation and spinal fusion with posterior instrumentation were performed under continuous intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (Figure ). Duration of hospitalization was four days. Mobilization began the second postoperative day and the patient was discharged using a Philadelphia collar.

Regarding his history, the patient was delivered at the 39th gestational week of a 23-year-old mother by cesarean section due to the failure of progression, weighing 2.4 kg, and was reported to have developed respiratory distress upon birth. Regarding the mother, she is medically free and was on multivitamins while there were no reports of any radiation or teratogenic exposure that was reported during her pregnancy. After birth, the patient was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for six months due to his abnormal respiration. There is no family history of any genetic disorders, consanguinity, or congenital anomalies.
Initially, the patient was suffering from developmental delay and extensor muscle weakness of the upper and lower limbs. Moreover, an epiglottopexy procedure was performed due to choanal atresia and a high arched palate. Afterward, he was breathing on room air through a nasal cannula. Ever since the epiglottopexy, the patient has been on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with no attempt to wean him off the ventilation due to poor response. Even though the patient did not present any gastrointestinal abnormalities, there was a difficulty in feeding, which led to nasogastric tube insertion for oral nutrition and supplementation. The patient also developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which was confirmed by testing; an abnormal facial shape, which was a dysmorphic triangular face; coloboma; and bilateral low-set ears. A shallow acetabular roof, micropenis, small bilateral kidney, high arched palate, and hypo-plastic left thumb was also noted (Figure ). Regarding the cardiovascular system, the patient had a moderate to large ventricular septal defect (VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, and mild pulmonary stenosis. Furthermore, the patient did not develop any seizures or loss of consciousness, but he was hypotonic. However, his gastrointestinal system showed no abnormalities.
Regarding the investigation, his blood work was within normal limits except for a low serum creatinine of 13 µmol/L (normal range: 71-133 µmol/L) and hyponatremia of 130 mEq/L. Meanwhile, his brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild periventricular leukomalacia, benign external hydrocephalus, with the suggestion of Blake's pouch cyst (Figure ). The genetic investigation was performed for the patient, and he was found to have chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), c.2572C˃T p(Arg858), and the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome was confirmed based on the physical examination and the gene sequencing report.

This means that the patient is 1 year and 3 oldThe patient's is a Male.
The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6.
The patient's weight is 2.4 kg. The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 2.4 * (130.0/140 - 1) = -0.103 L.

His hemodynamic status was stable with a blood pressure of 110/68 mmHg and pulse rate of 74 bpm. He did not complain of chest discomfort. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed subtle signs of acute ischemic stroke in the right-middle cerebral artery territory (Figure A). CT angiogram showed occlusion at proximal to mid M1 segment of the right-middle cerebral artery (Figure B). Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) was administered with standard dose of 0.9 mg/kg at 2 h 35 min after onset. During the thrombolytic administration, an electrocardiogram was performed and showed ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (Figure D). Initial cardiac troponin I was 137.4 pg/mL (<34.2 pg/mL) and creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) was 27 U/L (0–24 U/L). Due to the active cardiac condition and large infarct core from the CT perfusion the neuro-interventionist decided not to perform mechanical thrombectomy after intravenous thrombolytic despite the large vessel occlusion. The emergency coronary angiography was performed and revealed total occlusion at mid left circumflex artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug eluting stent placement was performed. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade flow of 3 (complete perfusion) was achieved after the cardiac intervention. The follow-up electrocardiogram showed resolution of the ST-segment elevation (Figure E). Serial cardiac enzyme following next 5 h revealed an elevation of both serum cardiac troponin I and CKMB of 4,643 pg/mL and 325 U/L, respectively. An echocardiogram revealed mild basal to mid inferoposterior wall hypokinesia with normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 62%.

We also performed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: T-score at L1–L4 lumbar spine was −1.57, and the patient was diagnosed with osteopenia.
Due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent hypercortisolemia, we performed diagnostic imaging; an adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of moderately enlarged left gland presenting homogeneous absorption with no focal changes, whereas the right adrenal gland appeared normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not confirm any lesions in the pituitary gland. The biological and radiological data were highly suggestive of ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome. Surgical removal of the left adrenal gland was performed. Histopathology results showed micronodular adrenal hyperplasia. The patient was prescribed indapamide 1.5 mg once daily and perindopril 5 mg once daily. Moreover, sodium and potassium, calcium, and vitamin D3 supplementation were prescribed.
Despite surgical treatment, in 2010, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to recurrent uncontrolled hypertension.

He had been under clinidipin and sitagliptin treatments for 5 years for hypertension and diabetes, respectively.
On physical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate was 70 beats/min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.5℃. The findings of auscultation were insignificant. Signs of collagen vascular disease were not observed, and the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. His chest radiograph showed an increase in consolidation in the LUL as compared with the observation a week ago. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse, patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in the LUL. Reticular opacities, on which our suspicion of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was based, were found along the periphery of both the lower lobes (). No bronchiectasis or honeycombing was observed.
Laboratory findings were as follows: leukocyte count was 8,700/µL, C-reactive protein level was 103 mg/dL, and anti-nuclear antibody was not detected. Arterial blood gas analysis was not performed because the patient did not have dyspnea. The other data were within normal limits. Upon admission, 750-mg of levofloxacin was administered to the patient for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
Blood and sputum cultures were negative. The results of the serologic tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also negative. On day 4 after admission, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed because the lesion in the LUL had not improved. Cellular components and lymphocyte subsets were not assessed for the BAL specimen. Culture, tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction, and cytology of the BAL specimen were negative. Video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed owing to increased infiltration observed on the chest radiograph obtained on day 10. Pathological examination of the tissue samples obtained from the anterior and posterior segment of the LUL showed that DAD was at its organizing stage ().
We immediately started treatment with high doses of parenteral methylprednisolone, and found that the consolidation of LUL decreased within 3 days after the initiation of the treatment. Further, antibiotic treatment was discontinued, and the steroid therapy was maintained for 3 weeks. A follow-up examination showed almost complete disappearance of the LUL infiltration, although reticular opacities on both the lower lobes remained ().",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [36.5, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [70.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [18.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [8700.0, 'µL']}",2,2,2,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 70.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8700.0 count/µL. To convert 8700.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 8700.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 8700000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2."

The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mEq. To convert from 140.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 22.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 215.0 mg/dL.

1112,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-5753882-1,Extracted,"We present the case of a 78-year-old male who had a few months history of mild dysphagia. He had been investigated at his local hospital with an oesophagoduodenoscopy (OGD), that had revealed mild extrinsic compression of the oesophagus and a computed tomography (CT) ( and ) scan that revealed a right-sided arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery passing posterior to the oesophagus. A Kommerell’s diverticulum was identified with both the origin of the left subclavian artery and the aorta at that level being aneurysmal, measuring 4 and 5.2 cm, respectively. The CT scan measurements were taken in corrected plan to the centreline. His past medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolaemia. Pre-operative work up with echocardiogram; lung function tests did not reveal significant impairment. He refused an open repair with potential prolonged recovery, as he was the single carer of his disabled wife.
Following multi-disciplinary discussion and after full consent, the patient underwent a bespoke hybrid endovascular repair, incorporating bilateral carotid–subclavian bypasses and branched thoracic endograft placement (branches for both common carotid arteries). A dual branch custom-made endograft (Bolton Medical, Inc., Sunrise, FL, USA) was manufactured with the following features: proximal diameter of 40 mm, distal diameter of 36 mm, total length of 270 mm and tunnel length and diameter of 45 and 10 mm, respectively. Those measurements ensure 20% oversizing for the landing zones.
The patient was positioned supine, sat up at 45°. Bilateral carotid–subclavian bypasses were fashioned sequentially through transverse supraclavicular incisions using 6-mm Dacron grafts. Both the left and right subclavian arteries were ligated proximal to the origin of the vertebral arteries. The justification of this bilateral bypass approach and ligation of native subclavian artery is the fact that stent graft implantation in the aortic arch, even with two branches for the two common carotid arteries, will cover the origin of both subclavian arteries including the antegrade flow to the vertebral arteries. Therefore, revascularisation of both subclavian arteries with preservation of flow to the vertebral arteries is strongly recommended to prevent posterior cerebral infarction. Right ventricular pacing lead inserted via right groin access was positioned and tested. The left common femoral artery (CFA) was accessed via a formal cut-down. The dual branch endograft was introduced over a stiff wire. Angiographic imaging was performed in the 30° right anterior oblique (RAO) projection for optimum visualisation of the origins of the carotid arteries, utilising an imaging catheter placed percutaneously through the right CFA. The endograft was then positioned in the thoracic aorta ().
Rapid cardiac pacing was commenced (target 200 beats per minute), and cessation of cardiac output was confirmed. The graft was then deployed under fluoroscopic guidance before return of normal rhythm and cardiac function.
The cannulation of the two tunnels of the stent graft was expected to be challenging due to unusual anatomy and orientation of the great vessels. Therefore, meticulous pre-procedure planning using the CT scan identified the best image angulation and tube position that unravel the origin of the tunnels in relation to the carotid arteries. Right and the left common carotid artery approaches were utilised sequentially to cannulate the tunnels in thoracic endograft. This approach was chosen because the carotid retrograde approach had a straight angle. Lifestream© (Bard Medical, Covington, GA, USA) (8 mm × 58 mm) balloon expandable covered stent was introduced first and followed by VIABHAN © (W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) (13 mm × 50 mm) in each side and deployed in telescopic fashion. The left and right common carotid arteries measure 6.8 and 6.6 mm, respectively. The stent graft tunnels measure 10 mm each. It was the operator’s choice to use higher radial force balloon expandable covered stent first to strengthen the stented segment of the artery as it comes off the native aortic arch and courses through the thoracic inlet while leaving the lower profile covered stent to overlap with the tunnel and match up the needed oversizing.
No balloon expandable or self expandable bare stent was used to strengthen the Viabhan stent because the course of the stent was quite straight and not compromised. This is different from chimney technique where the bridging stent is competing with the main stent graft for space.
No kissing balloon was used in this case as the adjacent tunnels of the branch graft are close but separate from each other.
Post-operatively, the patient was managed on the intensive care unit for 24 h and then in an intermediate care unit for another 48 h. His post-operative recovery was complicated with a chest infection that required treatment with intravenous antibiotics. A CT scan performed on post-operative day 5 revealed good position of the thoracic endograft and carotid stents () with no endoleak or graft kinking. He was subsequently discharged home on post-operative day 7. The patient demonstrated no clinical or radiological evidence of stroke. He remains well on 18-month follow-up with significant improvement in the presenting complain of mild dysphagia. The 18-months’ CT angiography that covers the head, neck and chest shows complete aneurysm seal, patent branches, patent vertebral arteries with intact circle of Willis and slight shrinkage in the Kommerell’s diverticulum and arch aneurysms, measuring 3.6 and 4.8 cm, respectively.

Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 3."
7370,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4414761-1,Extracted,"A 51-year-old male patient was referred to Asan Medical Center on August 10, 2005 for a rectal NET that was found incidentally on screening colonoscopy. The patient had undergone hemorrhoidectomy in his twenties, but otherwise had no significant past medical history. He was a non-smoker and non-drinker. His height and weight were 164 cm and 59.3 kg, respectively. His initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 116/74 mmHg, pulse of 84 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, and body temperature of 36.6℃.
Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory data and the results of urinalysis and stool examination were all within normal limits. Chest and abdominal radiography were also unremarkable. Colonoscopy revealed a 5-mm-sized subepithelial tumor in the rectum, 5 cm above the anal verge; histological analysis of a forceps biopsy specimen revealed a rectal NET that was positive for both synaptophysin and chromogranin. Abdominopelvic CT showed no definite rectal lesions, but did reveal a 7-mm-sized perirectal lymph node. Considering the small size of the lymph node and the rare incidence of small metastatic rectal NETs, the malignant potential of the perirectal lymph node was regarded as very low. We discussed the CT findings with the patient, and finally decided to first remove the primary rectal NET endoscopically, with more invasive surgery to be considered if histological analysis revealed any other unfavorable findings, such as lymphovascular invasion, ≥2 mitoses per 50 high-power fields, and/or Ki-67 index >2%.
Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed (). The tumor measured 8×5×5 mm, and the vertical resection margin was positive. The tumor involved the mucosa and submucosa without angioinvasion. The Ki-67 index was 0.8%. Hence, the lesion was diagnosed as a well-differentiated grade 1 NET (). Given the favorable histological results of the resected specimen, we considered metastasis to the perirectal lymph nodes to be extremely unlikely; thus, we elected to follow-up the patient using endoscopy (annual sigmoidoscopy for the first 3 years, then colonoscopy every 3 years) and annual abdominopelvic CT.
For up to 7 years after endoscopic resection, the size of the perirectal lymph node remained unchanged on CT, and no intraluminal recurrence was identified on serial endoscopic follow-up examinations. However, 7 years after the resection, the lymph node was found to have enlarged slightly, from 7 to 10 mm (), although colonoscopy revealed no evidence of recurrence in the rectum. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed on the perirectal lymph node, and histological analysis revealed a well-differentiated NET. Preoperative MRI showed two perirectal lymph nodes suspicious for metastasis. Laparoscopic low anterior resection and lymph node dissection were also performed. The surgical specimen contained two metastatic lymph nodes, measuring 10×8×8 mm and 6×5×5 mm, respectively. Although lymphovascular and perineural invasion were present, the resection margins were clear. The specimen was positive for synaptophysin, but negative for chromogranin. The Ki-67 labeling index was ≤2%, but no mitosis was noted. Finally, the surgical specimen was diagnosed as a metastatic, well-differentiated, grade 1 NET (). The patient was discharged without complications and was scheduled to continue to receive follow-up examinations on a regular basis.",What is the patient's body surface area?

He had developed sudden onset of palpable purpuric rash on his extensor surfaces of lower extremities especially bilateral ankles on admission. There was no history of recent drug exposure, immunization, or upper respiratory tract infection. He denied recurrent attacks of abdominal pain and fever. Family history for FMF was negative. Physical examination showed a temperature of 38.3°C, respiratory rate of 48/min, pulse rate 128/min. He was hypertensive at 140/100 mmHg. In auscultation, lungs were clear and the heart sounds were normal. Abdominal palpation was normal. There were symmetric palpable purpuric rash on his lower extremities.
Laboratory tests showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 45 mm/h (normal: <20 mm/h), C-reactive protein of 3.74 mg/dl (normal: < 0.3 mg/dl), hemoglobin 10.7 g/dl, hematocrit 32.3%, white blood cell count (WBC) 11900/mm3 with normal differential count, platelet count 340000/mm3, serum urea 66 mg/dl, serum creatinine 1.8 mg/dl, albumine 3.5 g/dl, total cholesterol 106 mg/dl, triglycerides 57 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, chloride 107 mEq/L, alanine aminotransferase 23 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase 16 U/l. Serum complement-3 (C3) and complement-4 (C4) were decreased (85.4 mg/dl, 6.6 mg/dl, respectively). Serum immunglobulin (Ig) levels were normal. The anti-streptolysin – O titer was 100 Todd unit and throat culture was negative for group A B-hemolytic streptococcus. Antinuclear antibody, anti ds DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anticardiolipine antibodies were negative. Urinalysis revealed macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria with a 24-h urinary protein excretion of 55 mg/m2/h. The fecal occult blood testing was positive. Renal ultrasonography (US) showed increased echogenicity (grade 2) in bilateral kidneys. A skin biopsy showed a leucytoclastic vasculitis and deposition of IgA. Renal doppler US was normal. Renal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to rule out PAN revealed normal results. Based on these clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed as having HSV with renal, skin and probable gastrointestinal tract involvement. A diagnosis of FMF was suspected because of the absence of occult blood in the stool and normal mesenteric MRA. Since there are reports of increase frequency of MEFV mutation in patients with HSV, we performed DNA analysis in our patient and found that he was compound heterozygote, carrying M694V/E148Q.
On the second day of hospitalization, He had periorbital and pitting pretibial edema. Respiratory examination revealed bibasilar crackles. His urine output decreased from 1.1 to 0.6 cc/kg/h and serum urea and creatine levels were increased (105 mg/dl, 3.5 mg/dl, respectively). We showed that serum urea and creatinine levels in figure . Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion (3 mm), minimal mitral regurgitation and increased inferior vena cava index and inferior vena cava collapsibility index.
The renal biopsy specimen consists of two portions of renal cortex and medulla. Forty glomeruli and many arteries are available for examination on multiple sections. The glomeruli are not significantly enlarged. They show variable, mostly segmental, expansion of the mesangial matrix associated with mild segmental mesangial hypercellularity. 25–30% of 40 glomeruli show crescents and/or necrotizing lesions (figure ). Another glomeruli show neutrophilic infiltration five glomeruli are available for examination by immunofluorescence. The mesangium contains peripheral membranous granular deposits of IgG (2+), IgA (3+), C3 (3+).
On the fifth day at hospitalization, hemodialysis was initiated for treatment of RPGN. Intravenous pulse methlyprednisolone was given (30 mg/kg, six consecutive days), followed by oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for crescentic and necrotizing glomerulonephritis, in addition to Colchicine for FMF.

His co-morbidities included atrial fibrillation, congestive cardiac failure, ulcerative colitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and antiphospholipid syndrome with a past history of recurrent deep vein thromboses; he was receiving maintenance warfarin therapy. On examination he was apyrexial, BP 200/132, HR 68, BM 9.1, chest was clear, there was mild to moderate epigastric tenderness with normal bowel sounds and mild resolving cellulitis of the right calf.

Electrocardiogram demonstrated a paced rhythm and chest X-ray was consistent with slight fluid overload, cardiomegaly and interstitial shadowing. The initial impression was possible gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. However tenderness was a prominent feature on examination, and in view of his co-morbidities it was important to rule out sepsis or malignancy.
Warfarin was withheld, vitamin K administered, and intravenous fluids given. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed (Figure ) which revealed subtle, non-specific bilateral adrenal enhancing lesions, the differential diagnosis for which included metastases, infection, granulomatous disease or haemorrhage.

Her usual treatment consisted of bisoprolol, torasemide, disopyramide, pantoprazol, acetylsalicylic acid and bronchodilators. She was referred to our hospital from another center following a diagnosis of HOCM manifesting clinically as intense dyspnea on exertion, occasional dizziness and episodes of chest pain extending to the left arm.
Preoperative ECG showed sinus rhythm (56 bpm), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and repolarization abnormalities, while a cardiac MRI scan revealed a maximum left ventricular thickness of 19 mm. TTE showed findings suggestive of HOCM involving the anterior ventricular septum, with a maximal wall thickness of 20 mm, peak LVOT gradient of 144 mmHg, grade-2 diastolic dysfunction, normal systolic function, systolic anterior motion (SAM) with moderate mitral insufficiency (MI), biatrial enlargement and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Upon entry to the operating room, the patient was monitored for the following: arterial blood pressure by invasive monitoring through the left radial artery, ECG with ST-segment analysis, oxygen saturation through pulse oximetry, capnography, Bispectral Index (BIS™) monitoring to measure the hypnotic effects of anesthesia, Near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS™ 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter, Covidien®), body temperature using an esophageal thermometer, central venous pressure and hourly urine output. When the patient arrived in the operating room, her arterial pressure was 145/69 mmHg and she had a heart rate of 72 bpm and oxygen saturation of 96%.
She was then given intravenous midazolam (2 mg), propofol (60 mg), fentanyl (150 μg) and rocuronium (50 mg). The trachea was intubated with 7.5 cuffed tube. Intraoperative TEE revealed severe hypertrophy (20 mm) of the intermuscular septum and LVOT obstruction with SAM associated with the mitral valve [] as well as a peak gradient between the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta (Ao) of 100 mmHg. Following the sternotomy, another measurement was taken from the surgical field using two catheters placed directly in the LV and the Ao respectively, revealing a gradient of 116 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, fentanyl and rocuronium. As the patient displayed a tendency toward hypotension, she required single-dose boluses of phenylephrine and continuous perfusion of noradrenaline at a rate of 0.04 mcg/kg/min to achieve an average arterial pressure of >60 mmHg until cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. An extended transaortic septal myectomy was conducted without incident. When CPB was discontinued, the patient presented ventricular fibrillation, which resolved with amiodarone (300 mg) and 3 automated internal defibrillator shocks of 10 J. At this time, the patient entered sinus rhythm at 40 bpm and atrial and ventricular pacemaker electrodes were placed at a rate of 80 bpm. Postoperative TEE evidenced resolution of hypertrophy in the LVOT [], an LV-Ao gradient of 8 mmHg, mild MI, absence of iatrogenic ventricular septal defects and normal biventricular function. LV-Ao gradient measurement from the surgical field was 7 mmHg [], which closely resembled the value obtained using TEE and thereby confirmed that the intervention had been done successfully.

He was healthy until three days prior to hospital admission when he developed a sore throat and fever. He went to his primary care physician’s (PCP) office where he had a positive group A rapid antigen test. His PCP gave him a prescription for cefdinir 300 mg twice daily for ten days and he began taking the antibiotic. His throat felt worse the next day and his fever increased to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. He called the PCP’s office but was not given an office appointment that day. On day 3, he returned to the PCP’s office with complaints of persistent fever, sore throat and new onset of redness and swelling over the left side of his neck. He received a shot of ceftriaxone and promethazine (to treat his nausea) and was told to put an ice pack on his neck swelling. That night, the patient’s wife noted he began acting confused and had some trouble sleeping. The following morning, the patient developed severe shortness of breath with intermittent air gasping. His wife called EMS, who transported him emergently to the hospital. The ED physicians observed him in acute respiratory distress leading to intubation. In addition to sedation/paralytic meds for intubation, he was given acetaminophen 650 mg per rectum, clindamycin 600 mg IV, ceftriaxone 2 gm IV, vancomycin 1 gm IV, and two liters of normal saline bolus. In the ED, he was later noted to have falling systolic blood pressures to the 60’s and was started on a dopamine drip and admitted to the ICU.
His past medical history included impaired fasting glucose and hypercholesterolemia, without history of surgeries. His home medications consisted of metformin 500 mg twice daily, resuvastatin 5 mg nightly, fish oil, flax seed, and niacin. Socially, he currently resides with his wife, denies tobacco or drug use and drinks alcohol occasionally.
On initial physical exam, his temperature was 104 degrees Fahrenheit. His first recorded blood pressure and heart rate were 141/81 and 117 respectively, but systolic blood pressure dropped to the 60s after some time in the ED. After intubation, his respiratory rate was 20 and his oxygen saturation was 100% on the ventilator.
In general, he was an average sized white male who seemed comfortable on the ventilator. He had normal sclera, conjunctiva and mucous membranes, but his oropharynx was poorly visualized due to ET and OG tubes in place. A large firm swelling over his left neck, which was erythematous and warm, was noted. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles and his cardiac exam revealed a fast rate and regular rhythm with S1 and S2 audible, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His peripheral pulses were strong and no significant edema was noted. His abdomen was soft and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. His skin had no evident rashes or lesions. The neurological exam and mental status was poorly tested due to paralytics given in the ED.
Initial laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 6.96, hemoglobin of 13.2, hematocrit of 38.4, and platelet count of 134. The basic metabolic panel showed sodium of 125, potassium of 4.0, chloride of 91, bicarbonate of 22, BUN of 7, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of 140, and calcium of 8.5. The hepatic panel was within normal limits. His cardiac enzymes, including CK, CKMB and troponin, were normal. Initial arterial blood gas after intubation showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 61, pO2 of 136, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 100% O2. After ventilator adjustment the pH normalized to 7.41 with a pCO2 of 35.
On imaging, his head computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no acute disease. His neck CT scan showed extensive soft tissue edema along the nasopharynx and orophyarnx involving the prevertebral and parapharyngeal spaces, in addition to a left peritonsillar abscess that completely obliterated the airspace except for the endotracheal tube ().
The patient was started on dexamethasone intravenously soon after admission. The otolaryngologist performed a bedside incision and drainage (I&D) of the abscess. Over the next couple of days, the patient was weaned off the ventilator and dopamine was discontinued. Due to an adverse reaction to clindamycin on day 1 of hospitalization, we changed his antibiotic regimen to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On hospital day 4, we extubated the patient. Unfortunately, that night he had a recurrence of dyspnea with stridor, which required transfer back to the ICU with repeat I&D of the abscess. After the repeat drainage, the patient had a smooth recovery and was discharged 3 days later on continued antibiotics and oral steroids.

81,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-4359532-1,Extracted,"A 62 year old Caucasian female patient (height - 1.60 m, weight 72 kg, BMI 28.1) was admitted to hospital with AKI (patient’s baseline serum creatinine was 85 μmol/L and eGFR was 63 ml/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD equation) whilst on treatment for mastoiditis. Her background medical history included hypertension, and type 2 diabetes for which she was on regular sitagliptin-metformin 50/1000 mg half tablet twice a day, metoprolol 25 mg twice daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. She had a long medical history of recurrent otitis media for which she required grommet insertion. She was managed as outpatient with topical and oral ciprofloxacin by her otolaryngologist. Trial of oral trimethoprim-sulphamethaxazole (Bactrim DS) was prescribed without much clinical improvement. Eight weeks prior to this admission, she had symptoms of earache, localised post auricular swelling and fever. A CT scan showed mastoiditis and a contiguous subperiosteal abscess. A brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and Technetium 99 m labelled bone scan which revealed osteomyelitis (OM) of the petrous temporal bone (Figure ). She underwent an emergency cortical mastoidectomy with drainage of the abscess and insertion of a new right ear grommet. Empirical therapy with ticarcillin-clavulanate (12.4 grams/day) was commenced.
A surface swab from the ear isolated Escherichia coli (which was sensitive to ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime and gentamicin, but resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin). Susceptibilities were done using Vitek2 (Biomerieux, Marcy l’Etolie, France) using standard Gram negative card. Based on the antibiogram the isolate most likely had underlying extended spectrum beta lactamase, although confirmatory testing was not done as per current testing policy (non-sterile site isolate). The operative specimens of pus and tissue taken at the time of surgery remained sterile. Her antibiotic was changed to cefepime (6 grams/day).
She made good progress and was discharged with a plan of continuing cefepime for 6 weeks as treatment of OM on ambulatory care basis. After 2 weeks of therapy, she developed malaise and dysgeusia. At 4 weeks, she developed renal impairment (serum creatinine-140 μmol/L) and the cefepime dose was reduced to 4 grams/day. Her blood pressure at time was 130/82 mmHg. There was no fever, rash or peripheral oedema. Urine analysis done by automated iQ200 (Iris Diagnostics, Chatsworth, CA) machine and manual phase contrast microscopy showed WBC of <10 × 106 /L, no RBC and no presence of either WBC/RBC casts. 24 hour urine collection (of 2.47 L) had proteinuria of 0.77 g/day (normal range-0.08-0.15 g/day). C reactive protein was 3 mg/L (normal < 5 mg/L). At week 5 into therapy, she was noted to have worsening AKI (serum creatinine 225 μmol/L) and was admitted for further investigation (Figure ). She suffered the ‘injury stage’ of AKI according to Risk Injury Failure Loss of kidney function and End stage renal failure (RIFLE) criteria and stage 3 of Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) classification at admission []. At this stage she was also noted to have serum potassium of 6.1 mmol/L (range 3.5-5 mmol/L) ,serum sodium of 148 mmol/L (range 135-145 mmol/L), serum chloride was 90 mmol/L (range 97-107 mmol/L) and blood urea of 15 mmol/L (range 2.5-7.5 mmol/L). There were no new medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), chinese herbal supplements or any other form of naturotherapy that were taken by her.
During her inpatient stay all medications except metoprolol were ceased. Though she was clinically euvolaemic and suffered from non-oliguric renal failure, 36 hours trial of intravenous hydration with normal saline (0.9% w/v) at 80 ml/hour was administered with minimal effect on serum creatinine, blood urea and serum electrolytes. Marginal increase of urine output was noted which was commensurate with the intravenous fluid administered. Laboratory investigations of aetiology of AKI were negative or not detected. This included: Double stranded DNAs, ANCA, extractable nuclear antigens, rheumatoid factor, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, complement levels, immunoglobulin subclasses, streptococcal serology and hepatitis B and C serology. An ANA titre of 1:1280 (homogenous pattern) was noted and was thought to be related as a reaction due to cefepime therapy. Renal ultrasound revealed normal renal size, parenchyma and no obstructive uropathy. A renal biopsy showed moderate tubular atrophy with many intra-tubular casts in the medullary area. A few tubules were distended with cellular debris and acute inflammatory exudate (acute tubulitis). Moderate interstitial fibrosis was present with patchy areas of inflammatory infiltrates comprising predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. Eosinophils were not detected in the renal biopsy. Periodic acid Schiff stain and Gomori -silver stain were negative on the biopsy. Immunofluorescence staining was negative for IgA, IgG, IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C1q, C3, amyloid and fibrinogen. Electron microscopy did not reveal any glomerular abnormality. (Figure )
It was concluded that this patient had drug-induced AIN, most likely related to cefepime. Cessation of the antibiotic led to a rapid improvement in her renal function over a week and therefore it was decided to treat her conservatively. The serum creatinine dropped from 295 μmol/L to 170 μmol/L within a week and then continued to trend downwards reaching up to 150 μmol/L on her 2 weekly follow-up post discharge. Her symptoms of malaise and dysgeusia had also abated at this visit. All the electrolytes (sodium, potassium and chloride) including blood urea were within normal ranges at this stage. Corticosteroid was not administered due to partially treated infection, diabetes and rapid improvement in renal function after cessation of antibiotics.
For completion of therapy (another 2 weeks) oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily was commenced, mindful of the fact that the isolate was resistant to ciprofloxacin with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 4 mg/L. Following discharge from hospital, she remained asymptomatic and continued to improve from her infection perspective. Sitagliptin-metformin, lisinopril and simvastatin were slowly reintroduced over the next 3 months after discharge while her renal function continued to improve.
Table shows the temporal trend in the biochemical parameters including serum creatinine and eGFR. Although serum creatinine has plateaued, mild renal impairment still exists at 8 months of follow-up (serum creatinine of 130 μmol/L and eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m2).
This adverse drug reaction has been recorded permanently in her electronic medical records and also has been reported to Australian Therapeutic goods administration (TGA).","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [62, 'years'], 'weight': [72.0, 'kg'], 'height': [1.6, 'm'], 'creatinine': [85.0, 'µmol/L']}",55.461,52.688,58.234,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 62 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 85.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 85.0 µmol. To convert 85.0 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 85.0 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 8.5e-05 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 8.5e-05 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.01 g creatinine. To convert 0.01 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.01 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 10.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 10.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.0 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 85.0 µmol creatinine/L converts to 1.0 mg creatinine/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 1.6 m. The patient's weight is 72.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 72.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 28.125 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 28.1, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
The patient's gender is Female.
The patient's height is 1.6 m, which is 1.6 m * 39.3701 in/m = 62.992 in. 
For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.992 (in inches) - 60) = 52.382 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 52.382 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 52.382 kg + 0.4 * (72.0 kg  - 52.382 kg) = 60.229 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 60.229 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 62) * 60.229 * 0.85) / (1.0 * 72) = 55.461 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 55.461 mL/min."

He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).

The patient's weight is 79.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 150.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 150.0 mEq. To convert from 150.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 150.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 150.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 150.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 150.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 150.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 79.0 * (150.0/140 - 1) = 2.821 L.

T2-weighted MRIs in sagittal plane revealed discontinuity between distal quadriceps tendon and upper pole of patella in both knee joints with the intervening space filled with hyperintense signal intensity, in definite contrast to hypointense signal intensity of tendon [Figures and ]; small joint effusion was seen in the suprapatellar region on either side [Figures and ]. Bones, menisci, and cruciate ligaments were normal. A diagnosis of bilateral spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture with stage IV CKD with hyperparathyroidism and metabolic acidosis was made.
Patient was treated with intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium chloride judiciously, and monitored carefully for the correction of acidosis and hypokalemia. Immediate cause of hypokalemia could not be ascertained; however, the potassium levels remained normal after initial correction. Ultrasound showed bilateral small and echogenic kidneys with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Renal biopsy revealed advanced glomerulosclerosis. After stabilization, surgical repair of the quadriceps tendons was performed by fixing the tendon to the patella through nonabsorbable sutures. Knees were splinted in extension followed by gradual weight bearing after 4 weeks and complete weight bearing at 7–8 weeks. She gradually gained the power and movements in her knees and could stand independently after 4 months. Peritoneal dialysis was continued and her PTH level came down with continued vitamin D therapy.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [20, 'years'], 'creatinine': [6.0, 'mg/dL']}",9.634,9.152,10.116,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 20 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 6.0 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (6.0/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**20 * 1.012 = 9.634.

1808,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-3601985-1,Extracted,"A 31-year-old Japanese man who worked as a janitor was admitted to Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh General Hospital for coma and convulsion in September 2010. During this summer, an exceptional heat wave was experienced in Japan, during which 1718 individuals died from heatstroke [].
Until admission, he had conducted a non-strenuous work in a hot environment for one or two hours. A work colleague found him staggering in the corridor and moved him to a cool room, where he developed convulsions lasting for 15 seconds.
A diagnosis of essential hypertension had been established at the age of 26, when a combination treatment of 50mg losartan and 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide, and doxazosin mesilate at 1mg were initiated. Since control of his blood pressure became poor, eplerenone at 50mg was initiated five days before admission.
Prior to his admission, no abnormal findings other than hypertension and obesity, with a body mass index of 27kg/m2, had been detected on routine physical examinations and laboratory testing. Repeated blood tests failed to show any abnormal findings in serum electrolyte levels.
His initial evaluation showed consciousness disturbance and a Glasgow Coma Scale level of 10 (E4V2M4). The temperature in his urinary bladder was 40.6°C. His blood pressure was 116/52torr, and his heart rate was 157 beats/minute. His respiratory rate was 34 breaths/minute.
The initial laboratory test findings are shown in Table . Abnormal findings comprised serum levels of creatinine 1.4mg/dL, sodium 114mEq/L and creatine kinase 756IU/L. He met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome [].
Except for severe hyponatremia of 114mEq/L, there were no abnormal findings leading to the development of consciousness disturbance. Serum levels of thyroid hormones and cortisols were normal. The results of blood culture tests were negative. No signs suggesting the presence of sepsis were documented. A computed tomography scan of our patient’s head failed to show any abnormal findings.
Based on these findings, the initial diagnosis was heatstroke complicated by dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, hyponatremia, renal failure and a hyper-coagulable state.
The initial treatment comprised cooling, intravenous fluid administration, tracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. The anti-hypertensive drugs and diuretics were withdrawn. We administered 5700mL of normal saline intravenously during the first nine hours. His urine output was 2000mL during the same periods. He was additionally given 1920mL of normal saline during the next 24 hours, when 3000mL of urine was excreted.
Our patient’s levels of consciousness rapidly recovered to 12 (E4V3M5) with his core body temperature returning from 40.6°C to 38.2°C within three hours of the initiation of cooling and intravenous fluid.
On the next day, he became fully conscious without development of central pontine myelinolyis. His serum sodium concentration improved from 114mEq/L to 124mEq/L within 18 hours. His core body temperature returned to normal (36.9°C). His general condition improved rapidly, and he was discharged on the fourth day.
Eplerenone was resumed and the hyponatremia did not recur. Because hyponatremia is a common complication of thiazides, we withheld the losartan/hydrochlorothiazide. Challenge tests were omitted because our patient did not agree to undertake them.
After he recovered, we took another careful review of our patient’s medical history. Surprisingly, he did not recognize feeling hot while working in a hot environment. Considering his clinical course, a diagnosis of heatstroke preceded by consciousness loss due to severe hyponatremia was made.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [116.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [52.0, 'mm hg']}",73.333,69.666,77.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

The child’s parents are young, healthy, and unrelated Caucasian people. The girl is their first child. The birth weight was 2680 g and length 52 cm. The Apgar score was 9 in the first minute. Head circumference noted at birth was 29.5 cm (<−2SD). The anterior fontanelle was small and closed quickly. Persistent foramen ovale (PFO) was found in an ECHO examination. Muscle tone was normal. An ultrasound examination of the head revealed a reduced mass of the brain. The milestones of development were achieved by the child with a considerable delay. The hearing and vision tests, as well as the metabolic tests (GC-MS, MS/MS, amino acids profile), were normal. TORCH infections were also excluded. At 4 months of age, she weighed 5.2 kg and was 59 cm long. Physical examination showed microcephaly, prominent occiput, and upslanted palpebral fissures (a).
MRI of the head showed that the frontal and parietal lobes, as well as the temporal and occipital lobes in the right hemisphere of the brain exhibit polymicrogyria and closed schizencephaly is visible in this hemisphere. There is a significant asymmetry of the hemispheres in the brain with the right one much smaller than the left one and additionally hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and a falx cerebri defect (d–g).

His breathlessness had gradually worsened to the point where he felt winded even upon getting out of bed. He also reported intermittent abdominal discomfort associated with a decrease in appetite for a similar duration. Initially, the patient sought medical attention from his primary care physician and was started on treatment for community-acquired pneumonia without any significant improvement. He denied any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Review of systems was unremarkable including bowel habits, which were regular.
The patient had been a nonsmoker his entire life but had secondhand exposure to smoking from his wife. His alcohol consumption was limited only to social occasions and he denied any illicit drug use. He had no known allergies, nor did he take any daily medications. Family history was not significant for any malignancies. No recent travel was reported and by occupation, he was a tailor.
On examination, the patient was found lying comfortably in bed. Vital signs were significant for a pulse rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. He was normotensive and afebrile. No cyanosis, clubbing, rash, or lymphadenopathy was noted. Respiratory examination revealed decreased air entry and dullness on percussion on the right side of the chest. His abdomen was distended, non-tender with a palpable liver and spleen, and he was noted to have shifting dullness. The rest of the examination was within normal limits. Laboratory data are summarized in Table .
Upon admission, a chest x-ray showed a near-complete opacity of the right hemithorax secondary to a large pleural effusion (Figure ). A bedside thoracocentesis was performed and 600 milliliters of whitish milky pleural fluid was drained (Table ). The pleural fluid analysis was consistent with chylothorax. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a large soft tissue mass in the region of the pancreatic head with extensive diffuse lymphadenopathy and minimal perihepatic ascites (Figure ). Further review of imaging revealed soft tissue deposits in the anterior abdomen and pelvis with peritoneal enhancement concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis. The initial impression was pancreatic adenocarcinoma with peritoneal seeding. An oncology consultation was requested and a biopsy of the peritoneum was advised due to ease of access. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of the peritoneal lesion with analysis of the peritoneal fluid (Table ) and a CT-guided placement of a right chest pleural drainage catheter was performed by interventional radiology. Analysis of the peritoneal pathology specimen revealed a mature B-cell neoplasm reported as a grade 2 follicular lymphoma (Figure ), and immunophenotype stains revealed CD20+, CD79A+, CD10+, BCL-2+, BCL-6+, CD5-, CYCLIN D1-, CD3-, CD43-, AE1/AE3-. Cytology from the previously obtained pleural fluid also demonstrated lymphomatous infiltration. Due to persistent right pleural effusion, embolization of the thoracic duct was attempted without success. The patient was eventually transferred to a tertiary center under thoracic surgery service for further management of the high output chylothorax.

She did not consume alcohol, tobacco, or any drugs. The patient was examined at the age of 18 at a gynecology clinic for primary amenorrhea where, given the patient’s active involvement in competitive track and field, she was diagnosed with athletic amenorrhea without further tests being conducted. Afterwards, the patient underwent no treatment and did not experience menstruation. Moreover, the patient had not engaged in sexual intercourse up to this point.
Upon examination by a local physician with the main complaint of abdominal distention, the patient was referred to our hospital with a suspected ovarian tumor, as a giant 17 cm tumor was found in the pelvis. The inspection of the external genitalia revealed clitoral hypertrophy and narrowing of the vaginal opening (Fig. ). Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumorous lesion in the pelvis measuring 218 × 115 × 178 mm, containing a mixture of cystic and solid components. The uterus could not be found. The cystic components contained blood, and the solid portion had a contrast effect (Fig. ). Examination by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed FDG accumulation in the tumor and in enlarged abdominal para-aortic lymph nodes. Blood tests revealed the following levels: white blood cells (WBC): 10.7/μL × 103; hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL; platelets: 412/μL × 104; C-reactive protein (CRP): 18.1 mg/dL; total protein: 7.7 g/dL; albumin: 3.8 g/dL; urea nitrogen: 8 mg/dL; creatinine: 0.53 mg/dL; total bilirubin: 0.6 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 30 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 8 IU/L; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): 52.4 mU/mL; luteinizing hormone (LH): 34.4 mU/mL; estradiol (E2): < 10 pg/mL; progesterone (P4): 0.66 ng/mL; and testosterone: 0.25 ng/mL. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (2.4 ng/mL) was within the normal range, but serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (5.86 ng/mL), lactate dehydrogenase (4574 µg/L), and CA125 (165 µg/mL) were elevated. Urinalysis was normal. As DSD was suspected because of the appearance of the pelvic tumor, chromosome testing was performed. The karyotype was found to exhibit 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, and the patient was diagnosed with MGD. Since the pelvic tumor was considered to be a gonadal tumor, a resulting complication of MGD, an exploratory laparotomy was performed in order to arrive at a definitive pathologic diagnosis of the tumor.
A physical examination revealed a patient who looked unwell, with blood pressure of 119/77 mmHg, heart rate of 117 beats per minute, and body temperature of 38.7 °C. Neurological examination was unremarkable and did not offer any substantial information. Surgical findings revealed marked adhesions between the tumor and the surrounding organs, making excision difficult. Therefore, only a biopsy of the tumor was performed (Fig. a, b). The final pathological diagnosis was “seminoma” (Fig. ). Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with clinical stage IIB testicular cancer (seminoma) with MGD.
Postoperative systemic chemotherapy was started promptly, consisting of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). At the time of the fourth course of BEP, tumor markers had normalized (Fig. ). Marked tumor reduction was confirmed with imaging, and subsequently the patient underwent interval debulking surgery. Surgery involved bilateral gonadectomy and resection of disseminated peritoneal lesions (Figs. a, b, ). Pathological examination of the excised specimens was consistent with necrosis of the seminoma due to the effect of chemotherapy. No viable tumor remains were found. No further chemotherapy was administered, and the initial course of treatment was completed. We notified the patient regarding MGD, and she decided her future sex as female. Therefore, we proposed some surgical options for clitoromegaly or vaginal stenosis. However, she did not wish to pursue those at that time.
Currently, 4 years and 11 months after the initial treatment, there has been no recurrence of the tumor. In addition, the patient has been on postoperative hormone replacement therapy in the form of an estradiol/norethindrone acetate patch and psychotherapy continuously.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [25, 'years'], 'weight': [48.5, 'kg'], 'height': [154.1, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.53, 'mg/dL']}",120.494,114.469,126.519,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 25 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.53 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 154.1 cm, which is 154.1 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.541 m. The patient's weight is 48.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 48.5 kg / (1.541 m * 1.541 m) = 20.424 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.4, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 47.039 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 25) * 47.039 * 0.85) / (0.53 * 72) = 120.494 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 120.494 mL/min."

His symptoms began 5 days before admission with lower extremity arthralgia and swelling. The pain progressed and a diffuse rash appeared over his back, legs, and abdomen. Physical examination was notable for palpable purpuric lesions distributed extensively across the lower extremities, abdomen, and back (). Laboratory studies were significant for acute kidney injury (AKI) with a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, hematuria and proteinuria >1 g/day. His baseline creatinine was 1 mg/dL 3 months ago.
Nephrology was consulted, and a clinical diagnosis of IgAV was made based on his symptoms, palpable purpura, and renal failure. The patient was admitted and started on intravenous hydration and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain. On hospital day 2, his creatinine sharply increased to 2.4 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed active sediment with hematuria and proteinuria. Acute glomerulonephritis from IgAV was suspected. The NSAID was stopped and changed to acetaminophen-hydrocodone. Glucocorticoid therapy was started with pulse dose intravenous methylprednisolone daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisone. Kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopy demonstrated diffuse proliferative changes with endocapillary hypercellularity, infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within capillary loops, and segmental fibrinoid necrosis (, ). There were no cellular crescents, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, or tubular atrophy. On immunofluorescence, there was granular staining of the glomeruli with IgA, C3, and Lambda light chains consistent with diffuse proliferative and exudative glomerulonephritis with IgA dominant immune complex deposits ().
Treatment with high-dose prednisone was continued. His serum creatinine decreased to 1.3 mg/dL. However, the purpuric rash became more widespread involving his mouth and throat, and the lesions on his legs grew larger. He continued to complain of abdominal pain. On hospital day 8, 6 days after starting glucocorticoid therapy, the abdominal pain worsened and was even more intense on hospital day 9. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed and showed extensive pneumatosis of the gut wall consistent with bowel ischemia ().
He underwent urgent surgery that night. On laparotomy, he was found to have a perforation in the duodenum along with ischemic necrosis of 6 feet of the jejunum and the entire ascending colon. The necrosed jejunum and ascending colon were resected and a vacuum-assisted closure of the wound was placed. After the surgery, the patient was critically ill in the intensive care unit with hypotension requiring high-dose vasopressors including vasopressin and norepinephrine. His urine output dropped significantly, creatinine increased to 4.5 mg/dL, and his serum potassium increased to 6.0 mg/dL. He was losing fluid from his abdominal wound. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started in the intensive care unit with a permcath. He underwent a repeat exploratory laparotomy that revealed contamination but no evidence of ischemia or leak. The colon looked viable. On hospital day 12, the patient had another exploratory laparotomy and a small bowel anastomosis with ileostomy. The surgical wound had delayed closure despite wound care and vacuum-assisted closure of the wound. The wound was large and widely open involving the entire thickness of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall ().
His condition was further complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding requiring embolization of the bleeding vessel by interventional radiology. He developed bilateral deep vein thromboses and underwent placement of an inferior vena cava filter. He had a prolonged course on mechanical ventilation and was switched from CRRT to every other day hemodialysis. Over the next few weeks, his condition slowly improved and his urine output gradually increased.
He was extubated on hospital day 22 and was eventually discharged after a 6-week hospital stay complicated by multiple surgeries, infections, delayed wound healing, and cytopenia. During the admission, he received multiple units of blood products including 19 packed red blood cell transfusions, 2 platelet transfusions, 3 fresh frozen plasma transfusions, and 1 cryoprecipitate. His kidney function slowly improved, and he was taken off dialysis. On discharge, his serum creatinine was 1.42 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen was 28 mg/dL.

9615,67,Albumin Corrected Delta Ratio,lab test,decimal,pmc-5788813-1,Extracted,"A 50-year-old male visited our emergency room(ER) because of generalized edema. He appeared remarkably swollen during the past week, with associated reduced urine output. There was no history of body weight change as the patient was bed-ridden. Specifically, he previously had no edematous disorders including congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism.
Fourteen years earlier, he was diagnosed with ALS when he was admitted due to quadriparesis. Motor neuron disease was confirmed by electromyography and muscle biopsy. Involvement of the autonomic nervous system in the disease process was noted, and tracheostomy and feeding gastrostomy were in place. In addition, the patient was being supported by a home ventilator.
On physical examination, vital signs were stable: blood pressure 144/89 mmHg, pulse rate 90/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and body temperature 35.0℃. Peripheral edema was remarkable at the neck, hands, and feet. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL, white blood cells 17,300/mm3, platelet 199,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen 20.8 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 0.25 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.015, albumin 1+, 5–9 RBCs per HPF, and many white blood cells. Serum sodium was 123 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 87 mmol/L, and total CO2 20.7 mmol/L. Urine sodium was 16 mmol/L, potassium 29 mmol/L, chloride 17 mmol/L, creatinine 6.8 mg/dL, and urea nitrogen 425 mg/dL. Serum and urine osmolality were 268 and 405 mOsm/kg H2O, respectively. Chest X-ray showed partial atelectasis of both lower lung lobes ().
In the ER, isotonic saline was infused to treat hyponatremia at a rate of 40 mL/h. Follow-up tests done at admission showed serum sodium 127 mmol/L, urine osmolality 223 mOsm/kg H2O, urine sodium 12 mmol/L, urine potassium 8 mmol/L, urine chloride 7 mmol/L, and urine creatinine 2.5 mg/dL. Serum uric acid was 7.3 mg/dL, albumin was 2.8 g/dL, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 93 pg/mL, and C-reactive protein was 33.7 mg/dL. Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were present in the urine, but they were not identified due to low abundance. Thyroid hormones T3 and free T4 were normal, serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 63 pg/mL, and the peak level of serum cortisol in response to rapid ACTH stimulation was 48.6 µg/dL.
shows the changes in serum sodium concentration and urine volume during the admission. Soon after admission, serum sodium dropped to 121 mmol/L despite isotonic saline infusion. Notably, true oliguria (200 mL/d) was encountered in association with increasing edema. We had to use intravenous furosemide, and a small volume (500 mL) of 3% saline was given once. The patient's oliguria persisted for 3 days, at which time generalized aggravation of the patient's edema was noted, and hyponatremia was not improved by diuretic therapy (). Intravenous furosemide was gradually increased (10 to 60mg) and was finally administered by continuous infusion (240 mg/d).
Furosemide was switched into tolvaptan to treat hypervolemic hyponatremia. The initial dose of tolvaptan 15 mg induced an increase in urine output (1,500 mL/d), while serum sodium remained the same (121 mmol/L). On the following day, polyuria was induced by tolvaptan 30 mg in association with an improvement in hyponatremia (). Urine sodium increased from 12 to 56 mmol/L, and urine osmolality decreased from 223 to 147 mOsm/kg H2O. When the serum sodium approached 130 mmol/L, the daily dose of tolvaptan was reduced to 15 mg. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient's edematous state, urine volume, and hyponatremia were stabilized with continued tolvaptan therapy. Following discharge, having been off tolvaptan for approximately one month, the patient's serum sodium concentration was 132 mmol/L.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [87.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Albumin': [2.8, 'g/dL'], 'Bicarbonate': [20.7, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [123.0, 'mmol/L']}",1.909,1.814,2.004,"The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 123.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 123.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 123.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 123.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 123.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 123.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 87.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 20.7 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 20.7 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 20.7 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 20.7 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 20.7 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 20.7 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 123.0 mEq/L - (87.0 mEq/L + 20.7 mEq/L) = 15.3 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.3 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 2.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 15.3 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.8 (in g/dL)) = 18.3 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 18.3 mEq/L.
Plugging in 18.3 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 18.3 - 12 = 6.3 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 6.3 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 6.3 mEq/L / 3.3000000000000007 mEq/L = 1.909. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 1.909."

The family had no consanguinity and no specific remarkable family history of seizure, delayed development, hypotonia, or language delay. His 24-month-old younger brother was healthy.
The patient was transferred from a local clinic for the evaluation of heart murmur at 9 days of life. At that time, a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 4.2 mm in size, a small secundum atrial septal defect, and a small apical muscular ventricular septal defect were detected by Doppler echocardiography. The patient weighed 3.3 kg (less than 3rd percentile) and had a length of 53.1 cm (10th–25th percentile). During the follow-up, he still showed poor weight gain and a short stature, with microcephaly. At the age of 14 months, he weighed 7.4 kg (less than 3rd percentile) and had a length of 75.9 cm (10th–25th percentile) and a 43.8 cm head circumference (less than 3rd percentile). PDA ligation was done at the age of 4 months. According to the parents, the patient had a delayed gross motor milestone from head control. The Bayley study performed at the age of 6 and 24 months showed a significant delay in both the motor and mental aspects, respectively. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that was done at the age of 5 months showed mild ventriculomegaly in the left lateral ventricle, and an arachnoid cyst ().
When the patient was 5 years and 3 months old, he was admitted to the hospital due to afebrile generalized seizure. Before the admission, he had had recurrent febrile seizures since he was 12 months of age, with a frequency of 2 to 4 times per year, with a semiology of ocular deviation to the upward and generalized tonic-clonic type lasting for 30–60 seconds. During the patient's hospital stay, brain imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) were done (, ). The interictal EEG showed moderate abnormality with intermittent bifrontal sharp waves, which were sometimes generalized (). As the baby's mother refused antiepileptic drugs medication, the natural course was observed without medication. At that time, the patient still showed severe global developmental delay, remarkable hypotonia, a short stature, and dysmorphic features such as microcephaly; small, low-set ears; dark, straight eyebrows; deep-set eyes; flat nasal bridge; midface hypoplasia; and a small, pointed chin (). The previous diagnostic work-up done at other hospitals, including the conventional chromosomal analysis, revealed no definite causes. As such, array-CGH analysis was done. The patient was rebrought to the hospital for the recurrence of seizure. An antiepileptic drug (valproic acid) was started at age 5 years and 11 months. The array-CGH analysis showed 1p36 deletion syndrome with a 9.15-Mb copy loss of the 1p36.33-1p36.22 region (). The FISH analysis confirmed the diagnosis (). At age 6 years and 10 months, the patient's developmental milestone showed 12 months of gross motor development, a 15-month fine motor status, an 18-month personal-social age, 18 months of language development, and a 16-month cognitive-adaptive status.

5077,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-2786190-1,Extracted,"An 8-month-old male infant came to our observation for multiple food intolerance and failure to thrive.
He had been exclusively breast fed until the age of 4 months, when a partially hydrolyzed cow based whey formula (Humana HA, Humana, Italy) was introduced by the pediatrician due to the mother's agalactia and family history of atopy. The child started to present vomiting and diarrhea after each feeding and a progressive failure to thrive. Blood, feces, and urine exams did not show any sign of infection, blood loss, or anaemia. Suspecting a milk intolerance, an extensively hydrolyzed whey formula (Nutrilon peptiplus, Nutricia, Italy) was introduced with resolution of the symptoms. Between age of 5 to 7 months, wheat baby cereals and various fruits were introduced without reaction. At the age of 7 months, 50 g of boiled rice was given for the first time. After 4 hours the child had severe vomiting, diarrhea, apnea, and lethargy. The parents took the child to the Emergency Room of a local hospital, where a new feed with 10 g of boiled rice caused the previously described symptoms. The child received intravenous fluid resuscitation and was then transferred to our hospital, Meyer Children's Hospital, University of Florence, Italy, for further evaluation.
At admission he was in good general condition, afebrile. His weight was 6920 g (3 percentile) and his height was 71 cm (50 percentile).
The physical and neurological exams were irrelevant. Routine blood exams were unremarkable, in particular total IgE level (1 IU/mL), antibodies against endomisius, IgA anti-alpha gliadine and IgG anti-alpha gliadine, ammonium, lactic acid, sweat test, and hemogas analysis were normal. Skin prick test (Lofarma, Milan, Italy) and RAST (Unicap System, Pharmacia) for major foods (milk, soy, egg white, cod fish, wheat, rice, peanut, tomato, rabbit meat, chicken meat), thorax X-Ray, and abdomen sonogram were negative. An endoscopy with duodenal biopsy showed aspecific signs of inflammation.
During the hospitalization, open challenges [] with rice and rabbit meat resulted in vomiting and diarrhea within 4 hours, while lamb and pork meat, apple, and corn were tolerated. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Meyer Children Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from the child's parents.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [6920.0, 'g']}",27.68,26.296,29.064,"The patient's weight is 6920.0 g so this converts to 6920.0 lbs * kg/1000 g = 6.92 kg.

He reported a 3-year history of nausea, vomiting, and diffuse muscle weakness. He complained of nausea and epigastric fullness in the absence of any identifiable organic gastrointestinal pathology, and his symptoms were known to subside after self-induced vomiting. Although he reported a normal appetite, he was known to vomit frequently, particularly after a large meal. He had been diagnosed with hypokalemia and had been treated with potassium supplements at a previous hospital. However, because of persistent nausea and vomiting, he was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of hypokalemia. His medical and family histories were unremarkable, and he did not report the use of medications such as diuretics and/or herbal medication. Physical examination upon admission showed he was 175 cm tall and weighed 44.5 kg, which indicated a weight loss from his previous weight of 58 kg over the previous 2 years. His body mass index was 14.53 kg/m2. Blood pressure was 100/60mmHg, pulse rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, and his body temperature was 37.0℃.

Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.557, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 65.8mmHg, and bicarbonate was 58.5 mEq/L. Urinary levels of sodium/potassium/chloride (Na/K/Cl) were 95/73.2/47mEq/L, respectively, his urinary creatinine measured 111.12mg/dL, and the trans-tubular potassium gradient was 17. Urinalysis showed the following findings: blood -, albumin ±, glucose -, and ketones -. Upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormalities. The SLC12A3 gene mutation test for Gitelman syndrome was observed to be negative. He was diagnosed with chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis with kidney failure and treated with saline hydration, potassium supplementation, and spironolactone. Serum potassium increased to 3.0mEq/L; however, his nausea and vomiting persisted.
A renal biopsy was performed for the evaluation of renal dysfunction. Microscopically, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration was identified. Renal tubular epithelial cells showed mild nuclear variation with conspicuous nucleoli and cytoplasmic vacuolization, indicating regenerative changes after acute tubular necrosis. Several foci of dystrophic calcification were identified among the tubular epithelial cells. A few shrunken glomeruli were observed suggesting ischemic damage; however, most glomeruli revealed no definitive abnormalities such as mesangial cell proliferation, segmental sclerosis, and/or deposition of immune complexes (). The patient showed an improvement in his gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment with mirtazapine.

8361,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7010591-1,Extracted,"A 47-year-old female (body mass index, 30.5 kg/m2 (160 cm, 78 kg)) presented in a corresponding hospital with acute pain in the upper abdomen after gastric bypass and cholecystectomy 9 years earlier and loosing 40 kg weight afterward. At the first consultation in the emergency department, she complained of massive abdominal pain since the night before admission, which did not respond to analgesic drugs. Because of the patient’s history of bariatric surgery and the suspicion of SBO, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which was inconclusive at the first look with multiple differential diagnoses. It showed a thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and a diverticulum of the duodenum with semisolid contents. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further treatment.
In our emergency department, the patient’s general condition was reduced because of pain and signs of diffuse peritonitis. The vital signs showed a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and an accelerated pulse (120 bpm), a respiratory rate of 25/min and a normal body temperature. The blood results showed a leukocytosis with only slightly elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/l). The CT scan was reviewed and revealed the presence of retroperitoneal and parapancreatic fluid with some air bubbles, which could also be seen in an additional abdominal sonography. Further a thickening of the colon ascendens was found (). A perforated duodenal diverticulum was likely and suspected. The thickening of the ascending colon was interpreted as an accompanying colitis.
Attributable to the reduced condition of the patient with little response to opioids, signs of diffuse peritonitis and our interpretation of the imaging, we decided to perform an explorative transverse laparotomy in the upper abdomen. Although the right colic flexure was mobilized, the exposure of the duodenum was difficult and very limited. However, a hard resistance could be palpated. After a Kocher maneuver and exposing the duodenum and the pancreas dorsally, we were then able to dissect the duodenal diverticulum. The diverticular wall was incised and a biliary stone of the size of ~7 × 4cm was exposed and removed (). Sutures then reattached the duodenal wall. A T-drain was placed intraduodenally, an Easy-Flow drain paraduodenally ( and ). Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for initial surveillance. An empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam was initiated. After one night, the patient could be transferred to the normal ward in stable condition.
The postoperative course was uneventful. Pain was controlled with basis analgesia and slowly she returned to a normal diet. Inflammatory markers were declining and antibiotics could soon be stopped. Ten days postoperatively, a fistulography showed a persistent retroperitoneal collection of 3 × 3 cm so the drains were left in situ. Two days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital in proper general condition but with extraduodenal drains still in place.
One week after dismissal, the patient felt well with normal appetite and a regular intestinal passage. The fistulography showed a significant reduction of the collection so the T-drain was removed. Two weeks later, she still felt irritated by the last remaining Easy-Flow drainage, which continued showing some turbid liquid and was therefore left in situ. Intestinal passage was unchanged and there were no signs of inflammation. Another 2 weeks later, the drain fell out by accident. Seven weeks postoperatively, still no signs of inflammation, we were able to finish our treatment.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [78.0, 'kg'], 'height': [160.0, 'cm']}",62.629,59.498,65.76,"The patient's gender is Female.

669,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-7192128-1,Extracted,"A 59-year-old male with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was referred for catheter ablation due to an increasing frequency of symptomatic AF episodes over the past year despite antiarrhythmic drug (ADD) therapy. After discussion of the risks and benefits of catheter ablation and different modalities for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (PVI), the patient opted to undergo visually guided laser balloon (LB) ablation. A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (55%) and left atrial (LA) volume index (32.1 mL/min).
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory and placed under general anesthesia for the procedure. Percutaneous femoral venous access was obtained using ultrasound guidance and modified Seldinger technique. An 8-French (Fr) intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheter (AcuNav™; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was advanced into the right atrium (RA) and a three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic shell was created of the RA, LA, superior vena cava (SVC), and coronary sinus (CS) ostium and integrated into the CARTO® 3 mapping system (CARTOSOUND®; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). A five-spline multielectrode mapping catheter (Pentaray®; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was advanced to the inferior vena cava (IVC)–RA junction and a 3D fast anatomic map of the RA cavity, ostium, proximal body of the CS, and SVC was created. A detailed map of the course of the right phrenic nerve (PN) was also developed during high-output pacing from the mapping catheter’s distal poles beginning at the right innominate artery–SVC junction and sweeping down to the SVC-RA junction (. Next a 7-Fr decapolar catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was positioned in the CS using electroanatomic mapping (EAM) guidance and previously acquired anatomy as visual landmarks.
The multispline mapping catheter was then exchanged for a long 0.032-in J-wire, which was positioned in the SVC under ICE visualization (ie, high in the RA with a posterior tilt) without the use of fluoroscopy (. A 63-cm-long SL1 sheath (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) was advanced over the long 0.032-in J-wire into the SVC under ICE visualization. The 0.032-in J-wire was then exchanged for a BRK-1 transseptal needle (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA), and brief fluoroscopy was used to confirm that the tip of the transseptal needle did not extend beyond the tip of the SL1 dilator. The proximal end of the BRK-1 needle apparatus was connected to alligator cables (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) and a pin box to facilitate live tracking of the needle tip on the CARTO® 3 mapping system (CARTOSOUND®; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). Under EAM guidance, the transseptal assembly was pulled down from the SVC onto the fossa ovalis (. The presence of interatrial septal tenting was visually confirmed on ICE imaging in the plane of the PVs. Successful puncture of the interatrial septum with the BRK-1 needle was confirmed on ICE by the presence of bubbles within the LA, and the SL1 was advanced into the LA. The BRK-1/dilator assembly was exchanged for the multispline mapping catheter, and a 3D map of the LA and PVs was created.
The multispline mapping catheter was removed, and an Amplatz super stiff guidewire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was advanced through the SL1 sheath and placed into the left superior PV (LSPV) under ICE imaging (. While maintaining constant ICE visualization of this wire in the LSPV, the SL1 sheath was exchanged for a 12-Fr steerable sheath-dilator assembly (CardioFocus, Marlborough, MA, USA). The LB catheter (HeartLight Excalibur™; CardioFocus, Marlborough, MA, USA) was advanced through the 12-Fr sheath and into the LA cavity. Under ICE visualization, the soft, atraumatic tip of the LB catheter was directly advanced into an upper branch of the LSPV without tactile resistance (. The catheter’s balloon was then manually inflated under endoscopic and ICE visualization (. The ideal antral position of the equatorial surface of the LB was confirmed on ICE by the presence of the balloon’s proximal end within the LA cavity and by endoscopic landmark visualization (. If the position of the catheter’s distal end interferes with obtaining coaxial alignment of the balloon with the PV ostium, the LB can be pulled back into the LA cavity while still inflated ( and the PV can be reengaged by gently pushing forward with the LB while viewing on ICE until the tip is advanced into a different side branch.
Following delivery of a circumferential lesion set around the LSPV antrum, the LB was deflated and withdrawn from the LSPV. Under ICE visualization, the sheath was deflected until the catheter tip was pointing directly toward the ostium of the left inferior PV (LIPV) (. The LB catheter was advanced into the LIPV and inflated until antral balloon contact was confirmed with endoscopic and ICE visualization (. A similar circumferential laser lesion set was created to isolate the LIPV (.
To cannulate the right inferior PV (RIPV) under ICE visualization, we utilized a “hockey-stick” maneuver. First, the LB catheter was withdrawn until just the atraumatic tip was exposed beyond the 12-Fr sheath. While still facing the left PVs, we maximally deflected the sheath and withdrew the assembly toward the interatrial septum while maintaining a curve on the sheath. To avoid damage to the LA posterior wall during this maneuver, brief fluoroscopy was used to reconfirm that the LB catheter’s soft tip remained beyond the sheath prior to RIPV cannulation. Using ICE, the 12-Fr sheath was rotated clockwise until the sheath–catheter assembly was visualized in the same plane as the RIPV (. Following cannulation of the RIPV and inflation of the LB using the aforementioned steps, the decapolar catheter was removed from the CS and aligned with previously tagged sites of PN capture. While pacing at a suprathreshold output, an antral circumferential RIPV lesion set was created while simultaneously limiting the likelihood of PN injury by monitoring the compound motor action potential amplitude and manually assessing diaphragmatic movement.
For cannulation of the right superior PV (RSPV), the ICE catheter was advanced superiorly with slight posterior deflection until the vein was visualized. After withdrawing the LB catheter from the RIPV, deflection on the 12-Fr sheath was released and the sheath–catheter assembly was slowly clocked until the LB catheter was seen in the same plane as the RSPV on ICE (. The LB catheter was then advanced into the RSPV and circumferential ablation was performed while monitoring for PN injury as described above.
After LB ablation of all four PVs was visually completed, the LB catheter was exchanged for a multielectrode mapping catheter and a postablation high-density voltage map was created of the LA and PVs, confirming entrance block (. Pacing from the multielectrode catheter positioned at the ostium of each PV was used to demonstrate exit block. The LB catheter–sheath assembly was then removed from the LA. After checking the final activated clotting time, protamine was administered intravenously and all remaining sheaths and catheters were removed. Hemostasis was obtained with manual pressure.
There were no complications during the procedure. The final ICE images of the pericardial space revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion. The patient resumed his direct oral anticoagulation regimen the same evening and was discharged from the hospital the following day. His AAD was discontinued three months after ablation and he experienced no recurrence of AF during eight months of follow-up.
Overall, the total procedure time was 146 minutes and the LA dwell time was 59 minutes. The fluoroscopy setting was 7.5 frames per second. The fluoroscopy time required to obtain transseptal access was 0.3 minutes. The total fluoroscopy time in the LA to accomplish PVI and confirm bidirectional block of all four PVs was 0.2 minutes.

There was no history of nephrotoxic drug use or intravenous contrast exposure. Ultrasonographic and tomographic imagings did not reveal urinary tract obstruction. Bilateral renal parenchymal echo increased consistent with the acute kidney failure and the bladder was empty. Also there was no electrolyte disturbances that could contribute to kidney injury such as hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, hyperphosphatemia, or hyperuricemia. He had a history of prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed 6 months ago but he did not accept the antineoplastic therapy performed for him. On physical examination, blood pressure was 115/80 mmHg, oral mucosa was wet and there was severe abdominal distension and tenderness. At admission laboratory values were as follows; urea: 116 mg/dL, creatinine: 4.7 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP): 77 mg/dL, chloride: 90 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 556 μ/L, pH: 7.49, pCO2: 35.9 mmHg, HCO3: 28 mmol/L. On urinalysis; urine pH was <5 and density was 1017. On CT there were multiple lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity, also gastric and duodenal distension due to lymph node compression on distal duodenal segment (Fig.). Intravesical pressure of the patient was 36 mmHg (normal levels of intra-abdominal pressure: 0–5 mmHg). Endoscopy revealed gastric dilatation and duodeno-gastric reflux. After nasogastric (NG) tube insertion, 8 L of gastric fluid discharged suddenly. After medical decompression intervention, urine output increased gradually and creatinine levels started to regress. But after the removal of NG tube, clinical status deteriorated again. Therefore, surgical decompression (gastrojejunostomy) was performed. After decompression operation beside the clinical and radiological status (Fig.), laboratory values improved, but intravesical pressure was not measured again.

The patient was referred by an orthodontist to restore her teeth before starting orthodontic treatment. Her weight was 125 kg and her height was 173 cm, which were abnormal for her age. The patient did not report any pain, discomfort or medical problems; however, the patient's response was late during the history taking. The patient had a history of successful repair of cleft lip and palate. Upon extra-oral examination, the frontal view showed facial asymmetry on the left side and flattening of the nasal bridge, increased intercanthal distance (35 centimeters) (orbital hypertelorism) and frontal bossing (54 centimeters), multiple skin lesions on her arms, and right foot and palmar/ plantar pits (Figures , , ).
The intra-oral examination revealed multiple carious teeth, painless hard swelling in the left side of the mandible, and mild pain on percussion in all the left mandibular posterior teeth. An orthopantomogram (OPG) showed bilateral radiolucent lesions associated with a partially erupted mandibular second molar teeth. The left mandibular lesion was extended up to the ramus of the mandible; moreover, the patient had a horizontally impacted maxillary right second molar and congenitally missing second premolars and third molars (Figure ).
Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was requested for detailed radiological assessment of the mandibular lesions. Accidentally, CBCT revealed another large lesion associated with the impacted right maxillary second molar, which extended up to the right maxillary sinus. In addition, the lower left lesion was severely expanded in all directions (buccolingual, anteroposterior, and superoinferior), and perforations were noticed in the buccal and lingual borders of the mandible (Figure ). A skull X-ray revealed calcification of the falx cerebra on the posteroanterior and lateral views.
In addition, the anteroposterior view of a chest X-ray showed a bifid fifth rib on the left side (Figure ).
A diagnosis of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome was made. Both maxillary and mandibular right cystic lesions of the jaws were enucleated surgically. Marsupialization was done for the mandibular left lesion and a biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination of the tissues showed KCOT of the right and left mandibular lesions and a dentigerous cyst of the maxillary right-side lesion. The patient was followed up every week after the surgery in the first month. The patient will then be followed-up once each month for six months. The tube will be removed after six months and then the patient will be followed up every six months.

She was 6 months and 26 days pregnant, with no history of smoking or childhood asthma. She lived on an outlying island of Japan close to northwestern Okinawa Main Island. She was diagnosed with bronchial asthma 7 years earlier, at which point treatment with salbutamol and inhaled steroids was initiated. She had recently developed common cold symptoms with yellow sputum. On presentation, she had a 1-day history of wheezing. She presented to a local clinic, where she received oxygen therapy via mask (5 L/min) and hydrocortisone (100 mg). However, the treatment did not alleviate her symptoms. She subsequently developed low oxygen saturation levels and was transported by helicopter to the emergency department. She was fully conscious and cooperative upon admission to the emergency department. Her main symptoms were dyspnea (Borg scale severity level 7) and tightness in the chest. Her wheezing was categorized as Johnson classification degree II. Her respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min. She was not able to lie down and remained in an orthopneic position. Her body temperature was 36.9°C (98.42°F). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.43 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count was 20 400 cells/µL. NPPV (V60 Ventilator; Respironics Inc, California, USA) was initiated due to hypoxia (P/F ratio, 163) using an NPPV mask (5 L/min; Confortgel Blue Nasal Mask, Respironics Inc). A nurse with expertise in respiratory care attached NPPV while assessing for the possibility of air leak. NPPV settings used were as follows: S/T mode; inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), 7 cm H2O; expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), 4 cm H2O; inspiratory time (I-time), 1.0 seconds; and inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2), 50%. Hydrocortisone (200 mg) was administered via intravenous drip, and a salbutamol metered-dose inhaler was incorporated in the NPPV circuit using a respiratory gas mixer (Aero Chamber MV, Trudell Medical International, Canada). Figure shows changes in P/F ratio, PCO2, respiratory rate, heart rate, and Borg scale levels at 30 and 60 minutes after the initiation of NPPV therapy. Her P/F ratio dramatically improved during the first 30 minutes along with improvements in PCO2, respiratory rate, heart rate, and Borg scale classification. After the initiation of NPPV therapy, her wheezing was resolved at auscultation. He subsequently shifted from the orthopneic to Fowler's position. Fetal heart rate (FHR), as assessed by the obstetrician using Doppler echocardiography, was 152 beats/min. She was transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the general ward. Oxygenation was stabilized to a level that can be coped with low-flow oxygen therapy, even if NPPV is temporarily discontinued after the P/F ratio is improved. Moreover, re-exacerbation of wheezing, dyspnea, tachypnea, and vital signs was not observed even if the NPPV mask was removed. Finally, NPPV and oxygen therapies were withdrawn. Bronchitis was suspected to have triggered the acute asthma attack, and she was treated with antibiotics. Inhaled steroids were administered. She was discharged on day 4 post admission. After discharge, her asthma was well controlled, and she was followed up by the doctor at the original clinic, under the advice of a respiratory specialist.

Blood tests were performed, urinary catheter and indwelling arterial line for blood pressure monitoring and serial blood gas measurements were placed. After anamnesis excluded presence of active liver disease and esophageal varices, the patients signed the informed consent so that a gastric tube was gently positioned to drain blood from stomach, and immediately after a Sengstaken Blackmore tube to in an attempt to stop bleeding.
Emergency endoscopy was arranged and performed with locally sprayed 10% lidocaine and minimal sedation with midazolam 1 mg, resulting in failure to identify and control active source of bleeding with endoscopic treatment. Following the worsening of hemodynamic conditions and impossibility to stop bleeding, immediate surgical access was scheduled. Patient was moved to operatory room and, under vital parameters monitoring and 3 minutes preoxygenation in 100% oxygen, a rapid sequence induction was performed with etomidate 0.2 mg*kg-1, suxamethonium 1 mg*kg-1, and fentanil 100 mcg. Cricoid pressure (CP) was applied in order to decrease the risk of regurgitation. Before the procedure, patient was not carefully studied for airway management, due to urgent setting, but a Mallampati 3 score and slightly reduced neck movement were recorded. At a first direct laryngoscopy, no glottic structures were visible; a second attempt, after aspiration of blood and releasing of CP, showed a Cormack-Lehane 3 grade with partial view of lingual border of epiglottis.
Intubation was attempted blindly twice with styletted tube, unsuccessfully, whereas ventilation by face-mask was getting quickly worse. As the oxygen saturation was descending rapidly (spO2 60%), a number 4 classic LMA was placed after repeated mouth aspiration. Mask was inflated accordingly to manufacturers' instruction (25 ml of air) and manual ventilation was obtained via gentle but frequent insufflation with 100% Oxygen. Once saturation was fully recovered, considering emergency surgery and aspiration risk, the decision to intubate through LMA was taken.
Optical instruments (video/fiberoptical) were not available. We then inserted a 16 Fr standard nasogastric tube (NGT) blindly through LMA, finding indirect sign of passage in trachea in easy advancement without resistance and repeated free air aspiration. Then, we cut proximal tip of NGT and kept granting ventilation passing proximal end of NGT via holed catheter mount. Next, proximal part of LMA with glued connector was cut and removed to allow passage of a 7,5 mm endotracheal tube (ET) through LMA by railroading on NGT [].
Before removing the LMA, the ET cuff was inflated and position confirmed by capnography.
After successful intubation, surgery started and patient was successfully treated for duodenal ulcer. Vital parameters were stable throughout the operation, but blood and plasma transfusion were necessary according to blood test results. At the end of the surgery, the patient was moved to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring and uneventfully extubated the day after using a safe extubation technique.[]","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [115.0, 'kg']}",155.0,147.25,162.75,"The patient's weight is 115.0 kg.

Furthermore, he suffered from remittent fever of around 39 °C and malaise followed by diarrhea and appetite loss 3 weeks before admission. Thus, he visited his family physician and was referred to our institute for further investigation. However, he developed chronic chest pain before the outpatient follow-up (1 week before admission). Transthoracic echocardiography and thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed a pericardial effusion. Because the pericardial effusion continued to increase, he was admitted to our institute for detailed examination and treatment of the underlying disease.
At the time of admission, his height and weight were 170 cm (70th percentile) and 47.2 kg (20th percentile, 0.8 kg less than 2 months before admission), respectively. Body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation on room air were 37.1 °C, 116/61 mmHg, 110 beats/minute, 14 breaths/minute, and 97%, respectively. On physical examination, he had a mildly pale complexion and eyelid conjunctiva, diminished heart sounds, anterior chest pain relieved by bending forward, and mild tenderness in the lower mid-abdomen. The patient’s laboratory findings are summarized in Table . No remarkable abnormalities were found on urinalysis. An electrocardiogram showed decreased T wave amplitude in V1 to V3, which may be a finding of low potentials due to a pericardial effusion and myocarditis. On chest X-ray, the cardiothoracic ratio increased from 41.0% to 55.0% in the week before admission (Fig. a). Transthoracic echocardiography showed an echo-free space of 30 mm from the apex to the pericardium on the left ventricular axial view, indicating a pericardial effusion (Fig. b). In addition, anomalous motion of the ventricular septum was also confirmed, and the diameter of the inferior vena cava was 22 mm, with no respiratory variability. After admission, a sudden drop of blood pressure to 85/70 mmHg with tachycardia (132 beats/minute) appeared on the second day. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed to prevent hemodynamic collapse; 500 mL of bloody pericardial fluid were aspirated by the puncture (Fig. c). His blood pressure recovered rapidly to 115/65 mmHg. The heart rate also decreased to 80 beats/minute immediately after the puncture. Thus, after the procedure, he was finally diagnosed as having cardiac tamponade. The aspirated fluid was an exudative pericardial fluid, and no malignant cells were found on cytological examination. No mediastinal tumor was identified on chest contrast-enhanced MRI, but contrast delay along the pericardium was observed, which was consistent with the pericarditis (Fig. d). Whole-body gallium scintigraphy also showed no abnormal accumulation. After pericardiocentesis, the inflammatory response decreased mildly, but the hematochezia persisted. To clarify the etiology, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy (CS) were performed. EGD showed no macroscopic or histological abnormalities. In contrast, CS showed multiple irregular-shaped aphthae on the contralateral side of the mesenteric attachments from the right transverse colon to the cecum (Fig. a). No abnormalities were observed on small intestinal capsule endoscopy. Mucosal biopsy at the ascending colon and cecum showed nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltration into the submucosa and some granulomatous findings with prominent neutrophilic infiltration adjacent to blood vessels (Fig. b). Head MRI showed nasal and sinus mucosal thickening and a cystic mass in the left sphenoid sinus (Additional file : Fig. S1). No abnormalities were found on renal biopsy. No genetic variants of monogenic inflammatory bowel diseases were detected on whole-exome sequencing of a peripheral blood specimen.

After diagnosis, treatment with intravenous prednisolone (PSL) (40 mg/day) and azathioprine (AZA) (100 mg/day) was started on the 21st day of hospitalization, and negative fecal occult blood was confirmed on the 29th day. The patient was discharged on the 36th day, and PR3-ANCA converted to negative during outpatient treatment. However, the PR3-ANCA level increased again, the fecal occult blood test became positive, and micro occult blood and protein were found on urinalysis immediately after PSL tapering was completed. Oral PSL was resumed, and methotrexate (MTX) (12 mg/week) was started after the recurrence. Currently, he has no apparent clinical symptoms, and PR3-ANCA has remained around 3.0 IU/mL with the combination therapy of AZA and MTX.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [47.2, 'kg'], 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",58.442,55.52,61.364,"The patient's gender is Male.

The blood pressure was 126/74 mmHg and the heart rate (HR) was 91 beats/min. Ultrasound sonography showed the fetus had a breech presentation with a weight of 900 g and a HR of 150 beats/min. For the induction of general anesthesia for a cesarean section, we performed total intravenous anesthesia with 2% propofol and remifentanil. After delivery, the target blood concentration for 2% propofol and remifentanil were adjusted based on the patient's vital signs and bispectral index.
Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes, and uterus incision-delivery time was 5 minutes. The obstetrician started operation through small uterine incision since he expected small fetus. But it was difficult to delivery due to small incision and breech presentation. Fundal pressure was applied on patient's abdomen. The neonate was a 830 g, female with no abnormalities, but did not cry or show any activity with a HR of 80 beats/min and SpO2 of 77%. A breathing sound was not auscultated. The 1-minute Apgar score was 1. The pediatric resident conducted tracheal and oral suction. Positive pressure ventilation was delivered using T piece resuscitator (Neopuff®, Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand). Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was 20 cmH2O, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 3 cmH2O. But the SpO2 dropped to 30%, HR was 95 beats/min, soft tissue swelling in the right supraclavicular area was observed. The anesthesiologist performed endotracheal intubation using a Miller #0 blade and a 2.5 uncuffed and successfully fixed the tube at a depth of 6.0 cm. There was no evidence of aspiration. However, the neonate's SpO2 was maintained at 40% even following intubation. On physical examination, aggravation of soft tissue swelling in the right neck, axillary, and supraclavicular areas were found and crepitus was palpable. Also, abdominal distension and severe cyanosis were observed concurrently. Upon diagnosis of right-sided tension pneumothorax, anesthesiologist was performed needle thoracentesis. Forty-six cc of air was aspirated in the 4th intercostal space of the midclavicular line using a 22-gauge angiocatheter. Following air aspiration, ventilation was achieved for both lungs, and the loss of edema in the neck area and reduction of subcutaneous emphysema were observed. The neonate's SpO2 gradually rose to 80% but the HR dropped to 59 beats/min. The pediatric resident began cardiac massage and administered 0.1 cc of 1 : 10,000 epinephrine into the endotracheal tube. The HR maintained at 180 beats/min and the SpO2 was 100%. The neonate was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The thoracic surgeon inserted a 7 French chest tube, and began ventilator care. The neonate was diagnosed with right-sided pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumomediastinum through the infantogram taken subsequently ().

He was diagnosed with HIV initially in 1999, during hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient also had a history of facial herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) which has been recurrent and a history of pneumocystis pneumonia in June 2005. Previous laboratory studies from November 2006 revealed a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 20 and viral load HIV RNA of 65,833 copies/ml. He was a social drinker and had never used illicit drugs or tobacco products. HIV was presumed to be acquired sexually.
On initial assessment in the emergency department, he was cachectic but was in no acute distress. He had a fever of 38°C, blood pressure of 92/60 mmHg and regular pulse of 85 beats per minute. He was breathing at 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air, which decreased to 90% during ambulation. There were no oral lesions. His neck was supple. Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral expiratory wheezes and rare rhonchi. Cardiac examination demonstrated normal first sound, second sound with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. His extremities were warm and his skin was dry with multiple small herpetic ulcers on the left ear and the left side of the face.
Laboratory tests revealed the following concentrations: sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 26 mmol/L, BUN 2.9 mmol/L, creatinine 61 μmol/L, glucose 4.78 mmol/L, white blood cell 3.4 × 109/L, neutrophils 86%, hemoglobin 7.1 mmol/L, hematocrit 33%, platelets 322 × 109/L, LDH 497 U/L, CD4+ lymphocyte count of 2. Chest X-ray was negative for infiltrate (Figure ), but high resolution CT of the chest revealed subtle right middle lobe and right upper lobe ground-glass opacity (Figure ).
The patient was admitted to the medical ward with a working diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia. A sputum sample was collected spontaneously for a culture work-up (Bartlett score: +3). No sputum sample was collected for mycobacterial stains. Empiric treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1 tablet double-strength × 3 per day) and prednisone (40 mg × 2 per day) was started. The patient was also placed on treatment for HSV with acyclovir (400 mg × 3 per day). The prednisone doses were reduced as part of initial therapy for pneumocystis pneumonia. On the third day, direct fluorescent antibody test for Pneumocystis jiroveci was negative, but the culture was positive for Bordetella bronchiseptica. The patient was placed on droplet precautions; treatment was switched to levofloxacin (400 mg per day). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole dose was modified to (1 tablet single-strength per day) for pneumocystis prophylaxis and azithromycin (1200 mg once per week) for Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis began. The patient subsequently improved on levofloxacin and on the seventh day was discharged home on levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, and acyclovir.

The patient is 42 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0.
Whether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 0.
The concentration of BUN is 2.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 2.9 mmol. To convert 2.9 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.9 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.084 g BUN. To convert 0.084 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.084 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 84.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 84.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 8.4 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 2.9 mmol BUN/L converts to 8.4 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is less than or equal to 19 mg/dL and so 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total at 0.
The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 0.
The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 92 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because at least one of these statements is true, 1 point is added to score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.

He was born a full-term, normal pregnancy without any complications after birth. The birth weight was 4 kg. The newborn screening test was normal. Since early infancy, he suffered from feeding intolerance and diarrhea described 5 times per day; oily, bulky, and foul-smelling without vomiting or bilious emesis. He was on breast and bottle feeding. By the age of 6 months, there was an obvious failure to weight gain and the family started seeking medical advice. Investigations were performed which excluded primary cystic fibrosis, alpha 1 antitrypsin, Metabolic disease (lipid metabolism disease), thyroid diseases, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease. There were fatty drops in the stool examination. A diagnosis of non-specific malabsorption was made and the patient was treated with multivitamins without any improvement in general condition. The family started feeding him PediaSure® formula milk - only by chance- from around 10 months of age with partial improvement in his symptoms and observed weight gain. His development was normal for his age. The child underwent all the compulsory immunizations for his age. There was no relationship between the parents and the family history was noncontributory.
On physical examination, his body weight was 9 kg (− 3 SD), the length was 75 cm (− 3 SD), he was vitally stable and generally well. The abdomen was distended but soft, with no masses or organomegaly. The neurological assessment was normal. The patient underwent multiple investigations. Complete blood count (CBC), C- reactive protein (CRP), blood film, blood gases, renal and liver function, electrolytes, glucose, bilirubin, ammonia, amylase, lipase, and urine were normal (Table ). Stool microscopy revealed fat globules. Abdominal ultrasound showed revealed intestinal wall thickening with normal findings (Liver steatosis was not observed). An ophthalmologic (funduscopic examination), cardiac assessment (echocardiogram) was normal. We performed an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed a milky white “snow-storm” appearance of the duodenal mucosa (Fig. ) and the histological biopsies from the duodenum showed fat-laden vacuolization of enterocytes without villous atrophy (Fig. a, b). That suggested lipid trafficking disorder. The Differential Diagnosis included abetalipoproteinemia (ABL), hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL), or CRD. Therefore, more specialized additional investigations were performed including total cholesterol (TC), Low-Density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and total lipid which were markedly reduced; high-Density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was borderline low with normal very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and Triglycerides (TG). Total Creatine kinase (CK) was elevated. Vitamin A, D levels were borderline low with low vitamin E levels (Table ). Lipoprotein electrophoresis of postprandial plasma did not show the presence of chylomicrons. Immunoblot testing showed a decrease in apolipoprotein A1 and apolipoprotein B.
The clinical and laboratory findings were more consistent with CRD. A blood sample for genetic analysis in directional direct DNA sequencing (AB 3730 DNA analyses equipped with seascape software) of SARB coding exons and exonic-intronic junctions from genomic DNA was obtained. Genotyping identified a homozygous SAR1B gene variant as the deletion of one of the two repeated Glutamine in position 113 or 114. It was the first description of this variant in the fourth helix of SAR1B protein (NM_0161032.: c.[del340-342]; [del340-342], p. [Glu114del]; [Glu114del]). His parents were heterozygous for the same variant (NM_0161032.: c.[del340-342]; [=], p. [Glu114del]; [=]).

On examination, her blood pressure was 172/85 mm of Hg, pulse 88/min, oral temperature 39.5°C (103.1°F), respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation on room air 94%. She was lethargic and confused. She had abdominal distention and diffuse tenderness without any rebound or guarding. Her PD catheter exit site was clean and dry. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 14.5 × 103/μL with 87.1% granulocytes, hemoglobin of 6.3 g/dL, and hematocrit of 18.4%. Serum chemistries showed sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 2.7 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L, blood urine nitrogen of 30 mg/dL, and creatinine of 7.7 mg/dL. Her liver function tests were within normal limits. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis without intravenous or oral contrast showed peritoneal thickening consistent with peritonitis, and there was no evidence of perforation or obstruction (). PD fluid analysis showed white cell count of 2173 per mm3 with 96% neutrophils and red blood cells of <3000 per mm3.
Blood and PD fluid cultures were sent, and she was empirically treated for bacterial peritonitis with intraperitoneal cefazolin and ceftazidime. PD fluid gram stain revealed budding yeast; blood and PD fluid cultures did not reveal bacterial growth. Given the high suspicion of fungal peritonitis, immediate removal of the PD catheter was discussed with the patient. She chose not to have the catheter removed, leave to Mexico, and get treated by her own nephrologist. Hence oral fluconazole was started for presumed Candida peritonitis. However, six days later, the fungal culture [Mycosel Agar and Brain Heart Infusion Agar] of the PD fluid grew H. Capsulatum.",What is the patient's delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [90.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [27.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [130.0, 'mmol/L']}",-0.333,-0.35,-0.316,"The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 130.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 130.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 130.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 90.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 90.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 90.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 90.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 90.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 90.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 27.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 27.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 27.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 27.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 27.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 27.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 130.0 mEq/L - (90.0 mEq/L + 27.0 mEq/L) = 13.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 13.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 13.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 13.0 - 12 = 1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 1.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 1.0 mEq/L / -3.0 mEq/L = -0.333. The patient's delta ratio is -0.333."

On physical examination, he weighed 63.0 kg and was 176 cm tall. The patient had diabetes for 20 years and suffered from diabetic retinopathy. He had unremarkable medical and family histories, but a smoking history of 90 packs per year. Chest CT revealed a 30 mm mass in the right upper lung lobe and mediastinal lymph nodes with advanced calcification (Fig ). Transbronchial biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) showed increased tumor uptake, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.16, and slight FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes. No metastases were detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging or FDG-PET (Fig ). Mediastinal lymph node #4 had a short-axis diameter < 1 cm, but was considered potentially to be lymph node metastasis because of the slight accumulation of FDG-PET; therefore, preoperative adjuvant treatment was performed. HgbA1c of 10.5 indicated diabetes was poorly controlled and required treatment before surgery. Diabetic nephropathy did not coexist and blood calcium and phosphate concentrations were within the standard range. During diabetes treatment, he received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The patient achieved no significant radiological improvement with two courses of this regimen. Based on radiological findings, he was diagnosed with yc-T1cN0M stage 1A, and surgical treatment was planned. He underwent right upper lobectomy and dissection of the upper mediastinal lymph nodes (2R and 4R). The lymph nodes were firmly adherent to the surrounding tissue, the sidewall of the superior vena cava was firmly fused, and there was invasion of the vascular wall. Despite this, the lymph nodes and superior vena cava sidewall were removed. The chest drain tube was removed on postoperative day 3 and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 14. Macroscopically, the tumor was well circumscribed and most of the tumor was calcified (Fig ). There was no bronchial or pleural involvement within the tumor. Acinar adenocarcinoma tissue was mixed with calcified tissue and PBs were confirmed. Similar features were found in calcified lymph nodes. The tumor was diagnosed as p-T2aN2M0 stage 3A (Union for International Cancer Control eighth edition). Immunohistochemistry revealed tumor cells positive for parathyroid hormone-related proteins (PThrP) 1 and 2. Postoperative examination indicated PThrP levels were within the standard range.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

2056,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-3838205-1,Extracted,"A 21-year-old female with a known history of aHUS presented to our emergency department in September 2012. She complained of general aches and pains consistent with her previous episodes of aHUS. She had three relapses before when she was aged 8, 10, and 20. They all occurred in September. She presented with 3 days of fever and sore throat followed by dark urine. On examination, she was found to be afebrile, alert, oriented, and she was talking in full sentences. Her sitting blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and her heart rate was 70 beats per minute with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.
Hematological investigations revealed a hemoglobin (Hb) count of 96 g/L, platelet count 16 × 109/L, red cell count 3.01 × 1012/L, and a hematocrit of 0.27 L/L. These results were consistent with normochromic normocytic anemia with mild polychromasia. There was also marked thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic anemia on the film, features suggestive of relapse of known HUS. Biochemistry results showed a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 1,201 U/L, haptoglobin <0.06 g/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, urea 20.7 mmol/L, creatinine 202 umol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate 27 mL/minute, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 27 mg/L. High levels of LDH and low haptoglobin levels pointed to severe hemolysis while the renal markers, such as creatinine, urea, and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed a deteriorating renal function. Earlier attempts to perform the biochemical tests had been futile due to severe hemolysis.
After a multidisciplinary team collaboration that involved the Intensive Care Unit, Hematology, Nephrology, and the Emergency Department, a left femoral vascath was inserted with the view of commencing TPE using 3 L of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The procedure was scheduled to be done in the emergency department using a membrane based TPE machine (mTPE). Plasma FLUX PSu 2S plasma exchange filters manufactured by Fresenius SE & Co (Bad Homberg, Germany) were used. These filters have a surface area of 0.6 m2, blood priming volume of 70 mL, and a plasma sulphone membrane. Filtration is primarily based on pressure gradients allowing filtration of molecules of up to 1,000 kDa including immunoglobulins, complement factors, and albumin. Soon after commencing TPE, the machine showed a blood leak alarm and it was evident that the membrane had ruptured gauging by the color of the effluent (). The filter was replaced with another one which also did not last long before the machine showed a blood leak alarm. The procedure was aborted after exchanging only three bags of FFP. An attempt was made to resume treatment with a centrifuge based TPE machine (cTPE). The centrifugal device we used was a Spectra Optia Apheresis System, a product of Terumo BCT (Lakewood, CO, USA). This machine operates by separating blood products according to their specific gravity using centrifugal force. The spill over alarm persisted on cTPE and “red blood cell detected” was shown on the machine. At this point, it was agreed to stop TPE due to the nature of the technical problems which were attributed to severe hemolysis.
On day 2, it was agreed that the patient could be treated with eculizumab (complement C5 blocker), but the drug was not available for compassionate access. We then revisited cTPE and the consultant overseeing our cTPE machine was contacted. We were advised to “disable” the red blood cell detector and cTPE was initiated successfully using a very low inlet flow rate ranging from 20–70 mL/minute with an anticoagulant infusion rate of 1.0 mL/minute. Heavily hemolyzed effluent was noted (). The patient continued to receive daily cTPE until day 16 when a decision was made that she had reached clinical remission, and she was discharged home. Her hematological () and biochemical () results continued to improve. A follow up of this patient after 6 weeks revealed that she was clinically well and had resumed her normal daily routines. However, plans had been made for her to have a permanent vascular access in the form of an arterio-venous fistula (AVF) in the setting of these recurrent aHUS episodes which seem to resolve after aggressive TPE treatment.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [140.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [90.0, 'mm hg']}",106.667,101.334,112.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Laboratory studies obtained at that time were significant for anemia, but with normal thyroid function studies. She had a 40 pack-year history of smoking, quit smoking over 27 years ago. Her home medications included: donepezil, metoprolol, hydralazine, Tylenol, colace, and cyanocobalamin.
The patient was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of FTT. Laboratory investigation revealed white blood cell (WBC) 16 K/uL, hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL, platelets 195 K/uL, international normalization ratio (INR) 1.24; complete metabolic panel shows serum sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, glucose 94 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, calcium 7 mg/dL, total protein 4.7 g/dL, albumin 2 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 57 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 10 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 18 U/L, total bilirubin 0.2mg/dL.

Surgical oncology team was consulted to evaluate the patient. On examination the patient had a nasogastric tube in place with bilious output, palpable non-tender mass in her right upper abdomen; the remainder the examination was unremarkable. The CT findings and management options were discussed with the patient, including a palliative care option. Patient opted for surgical intervention. After appropriate preoperative management, the patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for en bloc resection of the mass for presumed colon cancer with invasion of duodenum and kidney. Intraoperatively, ascites was noted, the bowel was edematous, and the mass was fixed to the right retroperitoneum, kidney and duodenum; the overall findings suggested major resection would probably have a poor outcome. Therefore, gastrojejunostomy and ileocolic bypasses were created to prevent progression to clinical obstruction.

He had no history of recent surgery or illicit substances use; however, previous frequent intravenous and/or intramuscular drug injections over shoulders and buttocks for gout attacks by local clinicians were mentioned. The patient denied smoking history and had no other notable medical record except low dose prednisolone prescribed. He also denied any recent invasive procedures or surgeries. The patient had consulted another hospital for similar symptoms before this visit. He was admitted and given serial examinations—an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and a TTE—but only a sternal fracture with a closed perifocal hematoma was found. During admission, the patient was diagnosed with Oxacillin-sensitive S aureus (OSSA) bacteremia, but no vegetation was detected using cardiac imaging. He was discharged with an uneventful course on his first admission.
The patient's persistent dyspnea and low back pain worsened, and he returned to our ED again 2 weeks later. On presentation, the patient was afebrile and had a pulse rate of 132 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a blood pressure of 117/87 mm Hg. A physical examination showed bilateral crackles, a right-side wheeze on chest auscultation, and a palpable fluctuant, non-tender mass (3 × 3 cm) over the anterior chest wall. There was no heart murmur and no skin rash over the chest wall. The patient's abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly. His lower legs were not swollen, and they had no skin rash. No visible erythematous changes over hand (Janeway erythema) nor painful spots over fingers (Osler's nodes) being detected.

No pyuria or hematuria was detected. An initial chest radiograph in the ED revealed no significant findings, and the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. A blood specimen was obtained for culturing and intravenous antibiotic agents (piperacillin and levofloxacin) were empirically initiated.
Because the patient's hemodynamic status and oxygen saturation rapidly deteriorated during observation in the ED, computed tomography of both chest and abdomen was arranged to detect a possible infection focus. A hypodense lesion with a peripherally enhanced wall and bone involvement was found in his sternal region (Fig. A), and multiple septic emboli lesions were found in his bilateral lung fields (Fig. B). Moreover, there was a paraspinal hypodense lesion with a peripherally enhanced wall and air-trapping over the T11 level. There was also one linear fracture line on T11 (Fig. A), and an L2 compressed fracture with a small anterior paraspinal abscess with gas density (Fig. B). CT-guided percutaneous drainage from the T11-T12 paraspinal space was done on day 2, and only minimal pus-like fluid was obtained for culture.
Because of the septic pulmonary emboli, TEE was done on day 3; it showed an oscillating mass (1.56 cm in size) over the anterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (Fig. ). The mitral, aortic, and pulmonary valves were intact, and there were no intracardiac shunts, either ASD (atrial septal defect) or PFO (perforation of foramen ovale) being found.

She had a history of SCA, which started when she was 55-years old with motor dysfunction. Her clinical condition had slowly worsened with appearance of dysarthria, horizontal saccadic eye movements, and lower extremities hypertonia. An MRI of her brain showed olivopontocerebellar atrophy; a mild motor and sensory ataxic polyneuropathy was highlighted by electromyography. Recent neuropsychological examinations identified a dis-executive deficit. Her family history is negative for SCA and she denied any history of cardiovascular, respiratory, or gastrointestinal diseases. Prior to the diagnosis of SCA, she was in good health and did not regularly take drugs. She denied smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. At the time of the examination, she was taking benzodiazepines (triazolam 0.25 mg once daily) for anxious depressive syndrome, baclofen 25 mg three times a day for spasticity, and anti-cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) for pain treatment (etoricoxib 60 mg once daily). Preoperative blood tests, electrocardiogram, and thoracic X-ray were negative. On physical examination, it was possible to appreciate that she was tall, 168 cm, and weighed 63 kg. A cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. Her vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg and heart rate of 90 beats per minute. On neuropsychological examination, she presented a mild reduction in performance on the Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, a limited ability to inhibit cognitive interference (Stroop Test), inability during the Multiple Features Targets Cancellation task, and a Spatial Span Score lower than normal; these were proofs of her dis-executive deficit. After discussing the case with a neurologist, general anesthesia was planned. In fact, our patient’s anxiety and spasticity would have made regional anesthesia difficult to practice. Preoperatively, no medications were administered. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg intravenously and fentanyl 2 mcg/kg intravenously. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg intravenously. Anesthesia maintenance was performed with sevoflurane (in an oxygen/air mixture) and fentanyl. The minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane was set to achieve a Bi-spectral Index (BIS) value between 40 and 60. Mechanical ventilation was set with a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an inspiration/expiration rate of 1:2. These parameters remained stable during the surgical procedure. The respiration rate was adjusted to obtain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) between 38 and 45 mmHg. The surgery was uneventful with no significant blood loss and no transfusion was needed. The procedure lasted 2 hours. Upon awakening, she appeared calm and parameters were stable. In the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), she was warmed up and oxygen supplementation was administered. Thirty minutes after awakening, she developed an acute hyperactive delirium. She experienced episodes of confusion, logorrhea, and disorientation. She also exhibited reduced awareness of the environment and hallucinations with aggressive behavior. During this episode, her vital signs remained stable and her oxygen saturation was normal. An arterial blood test revealed no hypercapnia or hypoxia or electrolyte disorders. Haloperidol 5 mg was intravenously administered slowly over 5 minutes, but her behavior did not change. To avoid uncontrolled pain, a single shot fascia iliaca block was performed with 25 ml of ropivacaine 0.375% but she continued to have intermittent episodes of delirium. After 10 minutes, chlorpromazine 25 mg was infused intravenously. This drug seemed to have the same efficacy as haloperidol with a subsequent mild sedation. She was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) where chlorpromazine 25 mg was given again during the night for another crisis. She was discharged from ICU the next day under normal neurological conditions.
After 1 month, she was readmitted for the development of an acute periprosthetic hip infection sustained by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus without signs of systemic sepsis. On examination, her temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 128/95 mmHg, and heart rate was 75 beats per minute. Only the wound swab was positive for infection; hemocultures and urine cultures were negative. Preoperative blood tests showed: hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL; platelets 233 × 109/L; neutrophils 4.26 × 10 9/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 47 mm/hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 27.2 mg/L. Renal and hepatic function indices were within normal limits. Debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) was performed under general anesthesia with the same modalities []. During surgery and after taking new periprosthetic tissue for microbiological examination, teicoplanin was administered intravenously at a loading dose of 400 mg. For the second time, our patient developed POD treated with chlorpromazine 25 mg intravenously with immediate sedation. Within 24 hours, the delirium resolved with no consequences. During the following days, 200 mg of teicoplanin was administered daily and 1 gr of cefazolin every 12 hours intravenously until discharge.
One month after discharge, she returned for follow-up. She was taking her habitual medications and, at the time of the examination, she exhibited no evidence of new disorders or joint infection. She looked well and denied any symptoms of confusion, disorientation, or hallucinations. The hip infection healed without any complication. She was re-evaluated at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Her ESR, CRP, and other biochemical values were within normal limits and her neurological status was stable.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She had complained of constipation, and 200 mg of MgO in divided doses daily had been prescribed earlier for 4 days by her family physician. According to the family, there was no stool discharge for 5 days, and the patient had episodes of vomiting twice in the morning in addition to a reduced level of consciousness. No remarkable findings were observed regarding her birth history, growth rate, or family history. She was not taking any medication, except for MgO as a laxative.
The vital signs on admission were as follows: temperature of 97.1 °F (36.2 C°), heart rate of 104 beats per minute, systolic and diastolic pressures of 110 and 60 mmHg, respectively, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% in room air. The physical examination revealed that the state of consciousness was E2V1M1 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Her extremities did not respond to pain stimulus; however, her facial expression was set and showed little display of feeling. The neurological examination showed a symmetric decrease in muscle tone. The deep tendon reflexes were also decreased, and the pupillary reflexes were sluggish. No abnormalities were observed in her respiratory status or heart sounds. The abdomen was distended with diminished bowel sounds, and a mass of stool was palpable.
The laboratory findings showed that the patient had fatal hypermagnesemia (11.0 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (377 mg/dL). The hemogram showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 26,760/μL) with bands accounting for 82.6% and no anemia (hemoglobin 13.9 mg/mL). Other results included the following: serum calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; serum sodium, 130 mEq/L; serum potassium, 4.0 mEq/L; serum chloride, 100 mEq/L; serum creatine, 0.17 mg/dL; blood urine nitrogen, 30.4 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.2 mg/dL; venous blood pH, 7.33; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), 36.5 mmHg; and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), 60.6 mmHg. An electrocardiogram showed normal and no block patterns. The blood cultures were negative. The patient was diagnosed with fatal hypermagnesemia caused by intoxication from a laxative containing MgO. She was instantly administered calcium gluconate infusion at 3.9 mEq for over 10 min. She was then continuously infused with calcium gluconate at 0.23 mEq/hour as a Mg antagonist to reverse the neuromuscular and cardiac effects of hypermagnesemia. She was kept hydrated with 0.9% sodium chloride to maintain good urine output to excrete the Mg, and a total of 720 mL was administered over the next 12 hours. An enema was performed, which expelled a large mass of stool and a large amount of muddy stool. After 2 hours, her serum Mg level was decreased to 5.9 mg/dL, and she regained consciousness to a level of being verbally responsive. Over the next 12 hours, her neurologic status continued to improve. Her serum Mg and glucose levels decreased to 2.4 mg/dL and 116 mg/dL, respectively. The patient recovered, and was discharged without recurrence of hypermagnesemia. At the follow-up visit 3 days later, her serum Mg level was 1.9 mg/dL. Five years after discharge, during a follow-up evaluation, she was neurologically well and had returned to her baseline status without a recurrence of hypermagnesemia and hyperglycemia.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [30.4, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [377.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [130.0, 'mEq/L']}",291.802,277.212,306.392,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 30.4 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 377.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 130.0 + (30.4 / 2.8) + (30.4 / 18) = 291.802 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 291.802 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 291.802 mOsm/kg."

The patient has a past medical history of mild hypertension successfully treated with clonidine, nicotine dependence, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Social history is significant for a 27-pack-year smoking history and rare alcohol use. Family history is significant for an older brother with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and sudden cardiac death at age 33 years. Autopsy showed evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of unknown etiology. Family history is also significant for multiple maternal relatives with premature coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.
The index patient’s initial TTE at age 31 years showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), normal diastolic function, no valvulopathy, and no left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with a septum measurement of 8.1 mm and a posterior wall measurement 10.3 mm in diastole. The patient was referred to cardiology outpatient clinic for further evaluation due to increased risk for cardiac pathology because of his family history. On presentation, he did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of active cardiac disease. He denied chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, orthopnea, lightheadedness, dizziness, and syncopal or presyncopal episodes.
Vital signs showed temperature 99.2°F, pulse 70 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 106/70 mmHg. On physical examination, he had a normal heart rate and regular rhythm, normal heart sounds, no murmurs, no evidence of jugular venous distention, and no lower extremity edema. There were no signs of neurological or dermatological disease. A complete metabolic panel and complete blood count were within normal limits. Observation and routine surveillance was recommended.
The patient had another TTE at age 33 years which showed mild LVH as his interventricular septum measured 12 mm and the posterior wall measured 13 mm in diastole. There was a normal resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient, but there was chordal systolic anterior motion (SAM). End diastolic dysfunction was not present at that time. More recently, at age 36 years during routine cardiology follow-up, the patient’s review of systems was now positive for rare episodes of orthostatic dizziness and progressive dyspnea with moderate exertion. The patient had a repeat TTE at that time which showed evidence of progressive, now moderate LVH. In diastole, the septum measured 17 mm which was increased from 12 mm on previous imaging and the posterior wall measured 16 mm which was increased from 13 mm on previous imaging (Figure ). There was chordal SAM. Grade II diastolic dysfunction was present with preserved LVEF of 65%.
Further diagnostic testing included an electrocardiogram (EKG) which showed normal sinus rhythm but no unusual voltage for LVH. Echocardiogram exercise stress test did not show evidence of ischemia or malignant arrhythmias with maximal stress. LVOT gradient of 33 mmHg was noted in the recovery phase with a heart rate of 106 bpm. No symptoms of chest pain or angina were noted. Duke protocol risk stratification was low. Cardiac monitoring for two weeks showed a predominant underlying sinus rhythm. No significant non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sustained VT was noted.
With the diagnosis of HCM along with the history of sudden cardiac death of his first-degree relative, he was referred for genetic counseling at the Genetic-Arrhythmia Clinic for further evaluation. Cardiac MRI showed HCM with a maximum interventricular septal dimension of 18 mm (Figure ) and a posterior wall dimension of 17 mm. There was no evidence of LVOT obstruction. There was a hyperdynamic left ventricular (LV) function with an ejection fraction of 64% and a normal right ventricle size, wall thickness, and systolic function. His genetic testing demonstrated a variant of unknown significance (VUS) for the GLA gene (c.574 A>T). Further measurement of α-Gal A leukocyte activity showed low levels of 1.5 nmol/h/mg (lab reference range ≥ 23.1 nmol/h/mg), which was diagnostic for FD. The patient was subsequently initiated on beta-blocker therapy with plan for serial cardiac MRI to monitor for progression of LVH.

Her KSS was manifested with external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and acquired left anterior hemiblock. Muscle biopsy demonstrated mitochondrial abnormalities. She presented with a high-grade Mobitz type II atrioventricular block (2:1) which required the establishment of a DAVID pacemaker/defibrillator (dual-chamber and VVI implantable defibrillator) 11 years earlier. She had undergone two normal vaginal deliveries.
Her pregnancy had been complicated with a progressive proximal muscle weakness in her extremities and preeclampsia.
On physical examination, respiratory rate) was 17/min, heart rate (HR) 80/min, blood pressure (BP) 165/95 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100% on room air. The patient's electrolytes, creatinine, and liver tests were normal. Hemoglobin concentration was 10.2 g/dL, and serum albumin level was 2.8 g/dL.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a pacemaker rhythm at HR of 80/min []. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitations and left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.61.
In preparation for cesarean delivery, multidisciplinary discussions involving her obstetrician, cardiologist, anesthesiologists, and the family of the patient were conducted, emphasizing the possibility of hemodynamic or the DAVID compromise during anesthesia. The obstetrician was instructed to limit the use of a monopolar electrocautery during the operation to short intermittent bursts at the lowest possible energy. Combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia was offered as the best option, and a written informed consent was obtained.
An external cardioverter/defibrillator unit with a pacing property to which she remained connected by external defibrillator pads, a magnet, and antiarrhythmic, vasopressor, and inotropic medications was on standby as rescue modality.
The patient was brought to the operating theater and volume loading with 500 ml of dextrose 5% in NaCl 0.9% solution was intravenously infused over 20 min, followed with an intravenous infusion of normal saline 0.9% at a rate of 5 mL/kg/h throughout the procedure. Monitoring was commenced with five-lead ECG with an active pacing mode [], noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. No sedative premedication was given. Oxygen (2 L/min) was delivered through a nasal cannula. Normothermia was maintained using a warming mattress.
CSE anesthesia was administered to the patient in a sitting position using a loss of resistance to saline technique at the L3–L4 interspace using an 18-gauge Tuohy needle. Then, a 27-gauge, 127 mm pencil-point spinal needle was then passed through the epidural needle, and after confirming free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 12.5 mg with fentanyl 25 μg was injected into the intrathecal space. Next, a 20-gauge epidural catheter was advanced 5.0 cm into the epidural space and secured. The patient was positioned with left lateral tilt with the electrocautery current return pad placed on her right thigh in an effort to minimize possible interference with the pacing function of the DAVID unit. A sensory level up to T4 dermatome, as tested by pinprick, was achieved bilaterally.
Surgery commenced through a Pfannenstiel skin incision. Ten min after the induction of anesthesia, transient severe hypotension (BP was 67/33 mmHg that lasted for 10 min) was treated with administering a bolus of ephedrine (5 mg). A bolus of oxytocin 5 units was administered followed with an infusion of oxytocin 20 units in normal saline 500 mL immediately after delivery. A baby girl weighing 3210 g, with 1 and 5 min Apgar scores of 9 and 10, respectively, and a cord blood pH of 7.25, was born.
Intraoperative vital signs remained stable throughout the surgery, with the exception of a noted decreased HR to 60/min near the end of surgery. No significant electromagnetic interference (EMI) was noted intraoperatively. Total estimated blood loss during surgery was 500 mL. The patient's intraoperative blood glucose, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and serum lactate levels showed no abnormalities. No local anesthetics were administered through the epidural catheter during surgery.
Postoperative analgesia was accomplished with a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.125% and fentanyl 2 μg/mL through the epidural catheter, lornoxicam (8 mg/12 h), and paracetamol (1 g/6 h). Her DAVID unit was interrogated by the manufacturer in the postpartum period.

She is the first child of healthy nonconsanguineous Caucasian parents, born after an uneventful pregnancy, with a birthweight of 3300 g, birth length 52 cm, and an Apgar score of 7. During the first 3 days after being born, she had breathing and feeding difficulties. Her psychomotor development was delayed: she was able to hold her head up at 9 months, to sit at 12 months, and to walk alone at 30 months. Since infancy, the girl had feeding difficulties and food reflux with failure to thrive. She also contracted frequent respiratory infections, two episodes of febrile convulsions, and epileptic seizures with onset at the age of 9. When she was 3, she was evaluated in the Pediatric Neurology Department for developmental delay; her clinical evaluation revealed speech delay (she said only few syllables) and cognitive delay with a mental age of 10 months. Biological tests, heart ultrasound, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were in the normal range. She started a complex program of therapy, including physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, with very slow and small progress: she is able to use the toilet, to eat on her own, and to understand few simple orders. She received valproate treatment for the epileptic seizures, with good response.
Her clinical examination at age 10 showed the following: weight 20 kg (−6 SD), height 107 cm (−4 SD), occipitofrontal circumference 47 cm (−4 SD); facial dysmorphism: upslanting, narrow palpebral fissures, synophrys, broad nasal bridge, short nasal philtrum,open mouth with down-turned corners, thin lips, high-arched palatine vault; dorsal kyphosis. The neurologic evaluation revealed severe speech delay with the use of only one word (“mama,” but not to identify her mother). The psychiatric evaluation revealed lack of visual and psychic contact, self-injurious behavior, hyperkinesia, and stereotype movements; she was not able to establish social relationships and did not show any evidence of protodeclarative pointing.
Psychological evaluation using the WISC Test (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) revealed severe ID (IQ 30).
Using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV Diagnostic Criteria for Autism, our patient scored 8 out of 12. She showed abnormal functioning in the areas of social interaction, communication, and symbolic or imaginative play, with onset prior to 3 years of age. Assessment using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) indicated impairments in social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, and abnormality of development. Her scores were as follows: 23 (cutoff 10), 10 (cutoff 8), 5 (cutoff 3), and 5 (cutoff 1), respectively.
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) was performed on peripheral blood genomic DNA according to manufacturer's protocol, using a 44K Microarray kit (Agilent Technologies). GTG-banded karyotype analysis was performed on chromosomes obtained from peripheral blood cultures stimulated with phytohemagglutinin according to standard methods. The genomic profile generated by array-CGH showed an interstitial 8p21.2p11.21 deletion, spanning approximately 16.2 Mb. No other CNVs were detected in our patient genomic profile, with the 44k microarray kit. The GTG-banded karyotype of the proband confirmed the deletion (Figure ); parents karyotypes were normal.

Consent for publication of this case report was obtained from the patient’s wife. Five months earlier, the patient started dabigatran etexilate 150 mg orally twice-daily for thromboembolic prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation [which is the dose approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function—the 110 mg dose is not available in the US]. One week prior, the patient was seen by his primary care physician for increased lower extremity edema and found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response averaging 120 beats per minute. The serum creatinine (Cr) at the time was measured at 1.20 mg/dL [estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) = 57 mL/min/1.73 m2 as reported by the hospital laboratory based on the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation]. The daily doses of verapamil, metoprolol, and furosemide were increased from 120 to 240, 25 to 100, and 40 to 60 mg, respectively. Two days prior to presentation, the patient fell while getting out of bed, but did not seek medical attention. On the day of admission, the patient was too weak to stand and vomited three times, prompting his family to seek emergency medical care. The last dose of dabigatran was reportedly taken 2 days prior to admission.
On initial evaluation, the axillary temperature was 95.7 °F, blood pressure 102/48 mmHg, ventricular rate 36 beats/min with atrial fibrillation (Fig. ), and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen. On examination, the patient was ill appearing but in no acute distress. The patient had 10 cm of jugular venous distension with monophasic waves and hepatojugular reflux. There were bibasilar crackles present on lung examination. Cardiac auscultation revealed a bradycardic, irregular rhythm, normal first heart sound with a physiologically split second heart sound, and a III/VI systolic murmur loudest at the upper sternal border. The abdomen was benign without organomegaly. There was 3+ pitting edema of the extremities with normal pulses bilaterally.
Upon arrival to the emergency department 2 L of intravenous (IV) normal saline and 1 mg of IV glucagon were administered. A chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate (Fig. ), cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Laboratory studies were notable for acute renal failure and hepatic dysfunction, which likely developed in the setting of septic shock from pneumonia, potentially compounded by recently increased diuretic therapy and bradycardia in the setting of uptitration of nodal blockade (Table ; Fig. ). In conjunction, laboratory studies revealed electrolyte disturbances, elevated serum lactate, and profound coagulopathy (Table ; Fig. ). The patient received 10 units of IV insulin, 50 g of IV dextrose, 2 g of IV calcium gluconate, and 50 mEq of IV sodium bicarbonate to manage hyperkalemia. Computed tomography of the head, neck, and cervical spine did not show evidence of acute hemorrhage or fracture.
On admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the heart rate was irregular at 48 beats/min and the blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. The patient rapidly developed worsening hypoxia and was placed on 70% oxygen at 35 L/min delivered by high flow nasal cannula. During a phlebotomy, the patient became acutely unresponsive with a loss of palpable pulses. The cardiac monitor revealed progressive bradycardia to less than 30 beats/min. The patient received approximately 2.5 min of chest compressions with return of spontaneous circulation, was intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation.
The patient did not demonstrate any overt signs of active bleeding at any point during the hospitalization. On admission, the hematocrit was 43.5%, consistent with the patient’s baseline value. In the setting of receiving a total of 4.5 L of IV normal saline during the first day of hospitalization, the hematocrit dropped to a nadir of 33.9%, but gradually improved without infusion of red blood cells to 38.3% on day of discharge. However, taking into account the history of a recent fall, need for central venous access, and presence of multi-organ failure in the elderly gentleman with possible need for dialysis, the decision was made to reverse the coagulopathy. A reversal strategy was pursued that attempted to counteract both dabigatran toxicity and the potential for decreased hepatic synthesis of clotting factors given concern for hepatic injury in the setting of an acute transaminitis. The patient’s history of heart failure and acute renal failure limited the amount of high volume blood products that could be administered and more concentrated forms of coagulation factor replacement were considered. A total of 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 15 mg of vitamin K (initially 5 mg orally, then 10 mg IV), and 5,020 international units (IU) of IV inactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC; Profilnine®, Grifols Biologicals, Inc, Los Angeles, CA, USA) were administered on the first day of hospitalization (Fig. ). The prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) peaked in the first 24 h and then gradually returned to normal (Fig. ). Coagulopathy was further measured using the thrombin time at 7, 24, and 26 h after admission and was >150 s (normal range 15–30) at all three measurements. A diluted thrombin time (one part patient plasma to three parts normal plasma) was measured at 24 and 26 h and was 125.0 and 113.1 s, respectively (Table ). The hepatic transaminases and renal function also peaked on the first day with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 4,590 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 4,965 U/L, and Cr of 3.07 mg/dL (eGFR ≤20 mL/min/1.73 m2). Thereafter, the patient’s Cr, transaminases, and coagulation parameters trended downward over the course of 10 days (Fig. ).
The patient was stabilized and treated for pneumonia in the intensive care unit for 7 days. The patient was extubated on day 5, had no signs of bleeding, and was discharged home on hospital day 19. On hospital day 5, the patient’s international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.8 (see Fig. for trend) with a PTT of 46.9 s, at which time an unfractionated heparin infusion was started for stroke prevention secondary to atrial fibrillation given a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 5 (indicating a high yearly risk of stroke), and concern that the patient was unable to reliably take oral medications in the setting of acute illness and deconditioning. However, the patient regained ability to take oral medications more quickly than anticipated and was, therefore, started on warfarin on hospital day 7. On the day of discharge, the Cr was 0.70 mg/dL (eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) with a PTT of 41.3 s and INR of 1.8 on warfarin. The ALT and AST were last measured on hospital day 10 at 271 and 32 U/L, respectively.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Heart Rate or Pulse': [120.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': True, 'Hemoptysis': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': False, 'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False}",3.0,3.0,3.0,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

Past medical history includes end stage renal disease on hemodialysis therapy, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusion with placement of pericardial window. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 per minute, O2 sat of 96% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. There were internal jugular vein distention, irregular heart sounds, and basilar lung crackles bilaterally. Electrocardiogram (EKG) confirmed atrial fibrillation and right ventricle hypertrophy with right axis deviation. There were normal QRS voltage and complexes, T waves, and ST segments. Laboratory data were remarkable for troponin I 0.04 ng/ml (normal < 0.02 ng/ml), pro-brain natriuretic peptide 108,187 pg/ml, potassium 3.4 mmol/Lt, creatinine 2.8 mg/dl, hemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, total bilirubin 1.41 mg/dl, and albumin 3.1 gr/dl. Cardiomegaly and blunting of the right and left cost phrenic angles were evident on chest X-ray.
Patient was admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) for fluid overload secondary to missing hemodialysis therapy and severe pulmonary hypertension. While in MICU, transthoracic echocardiogram was done, which revealed normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction > 55%) and severe tricuspid regurgitation (coronary sinus and right atrium were noted to be dilated, and a small loculated pericardial effusion was seen behind the right atrium, with no evidence of cardiac tamponade. Right ventricular systolic pressure was elevated at >60 mm Hg, consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension, and flattening of the interventricular septum (D-shaped left ventricle) with RV overload ().
Shortly thereafter, renal service was consulted and hemodialysis was initiated. Vital signs were recorded and reviewed, while the patient was undergoing hemodialysis therapy, as is illustrated on , the blood pressure trended up continuously as volume was being removed.
After hemodialysis session, the patient's shortness of breath improved and blood pressure trended up instead down as we may expect in normal individuals after removing intravascular volume. Transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated and demonstrated less left deviation of interventricular septum compared with previous echocardiogram ().

She underwent multiple surgeries on her left ear due to chronic otitis media, including a subtotal petrosectomy and a cochlear implant one year ago. Without improvement of her pain with wound debridement and antibiotic medication, cochlear implant removal was planned. Preoperative 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a slurred QRS complex and J point elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (), which was not different from the ECG performed a year ago in a previous pre-anesthetic work-up. Preoperative laboratory examinations and two-dimensional echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities.
The patient was monitored using pulse oximetry, automated blood pressure measurement, capnography, and three-lead ECG. Anesthesia was induced using propofol 140 mg, sevoflurane 6% vol, and rocuronium 40 mg, and tracheal intubation was performed. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1–2% vol, 1 L/min N2O, and 1 L/min O2. During the 4 h procedure, four episodes of transient ST segment elevation in lead II were observed, with maximum ST segment amplitude of 0.3 mV (, ). The ECG pattern changed from a slurred to a notched appearance, with a J point elevation changing from 0.1 mV to 0.2 mV (). Each elevation lasted < 5 min without hemodynamic instability. Coronary artery spasm or benign ECG findings of the ER pattern were considered. At the third episode of ST segment change, cardiac markers were noted, and both troponin-I (0.006 ng/ml) and creatine kinase-MB (0.4 ng/ml) were within normal ranges. Given that ECG changes were temporal and without hemodynamic change, and laboratory investigations were normal, diagnosis could not be established and, thus, no immediate treatment was pursued.
After uneventful extubation, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU). However, she complained of chest discomfort. On three-lead ECG monitoring, ST-segment elevation was not observed. For detailed evaluation, a 12-lead ECG was performed, but was no different from the preoperative ECG. Although vital signs and cardiac enzyme levels, including troponin-I (0.006 ng/ml) and creatine kinase-MB (0.2 ng/ml), were within normal range, VA was considered based on the intraoperative transient ST changes and symptoms in the PACU. Therefore, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered; however, its effect was unclear, and the chest discomfort lasted for approximately 1 h. After symptoms subsided, the patient was transferred to the general ward because vital signs were stable throughout the entire period and laboratory findings were within normal ranges. On follow-up consultation with the cardiology department, the possibility of coronary artery spasm was raised. However, the patient refused further work-ups, including echocardiography and coronary angiogram. The patient was discharged 10 days later without further complaints of chest symptoms and, thus, the cause of ST elevations remained unclear.",What is the patient's body surface area?

484,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-8406562-1,Extracted,"The patient was a 49-year-old man with chronic renal insufficiency. He underwent right renal transplantation in the Chinese People's Armed Police Force General Hospital in November 2016. Following transplantation, the patient underwent immunosuppression therapy, which included tacrolimus, prednisone, and myfortic, resulting in the return of normal renal function in the patient.
Two years later, the level of sCr in the patient gradually increased from normal to 274 mmol/L during routine laboratory testing. Enhanced MRI demonstrated multiple, variably sized quasi-circular lesions with slightly short signal intensity on T1WI, slightly long signal intensity on T2WI, and high signal intensity on DWI. The larger size lesion was about 4.66 cm by 3.10 cm (Fig. ). PET-CT revealed a soft tissue mass in the pelvis of the transplanted kidney (with an elevated SUV of 2.6), and multiple metastatic hypermetabolic soft tissue density nodules can be observed in the parenchyma of the transplanted kidney (with a maximum SUV of 2.9). No metastatic hypermetabolic lesions were observed in any other parts of the body.
A puncture biopsy of the transplanted kidney was performed, and the results indicated large neoplastic cells. The immunohistochemistry examination revealed the following: CD34 (few +), CD68 (KP1) (few +), CD163 (-), lysozyme (few +), MPO (+), Ki-67 (>70% +), CD3 (few +), CD20 (-), TdT (few +), CD15 (-), CD117 (+), FISH: EBER(-). Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of leukemic infiltration (Fig. ), with normal chromosomes (46, XY). Examinations of fusion genes for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myeloid leukemia were negative. NGS examinations of the transplanted kidney was performed on 34 commonly mutated genes in AML (listed in ) and showed mutations of KRAS (NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12Drs121913529), DNMT3A (NM_022552:exon15:c.1675delT:p.C559fs) , and no gene mutations in the bone marrow. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with de novo MS in the transplanted kidney. Detailed information on the donor was not available, but the other transplant recipient did not have any problems in the transplanted kidney.
The patient underwent systemic chemotherapy in our hospital in October 2019, and received DA regimen chemotherapy (daunorubicin 100 mg on days 1-3 and cytarabine 170 mg on days 1-7). The patient responded well to the treatment, and the size of the mass in the transplanted kidney decreased and the level of sCr decreased to 192 mmol/L. The patient underwent a second cycle of DA regimen chemotherapy 30 days later. The size of the biggest lesion decreased to 2.5cm by 1.8cm, but the level of sCr remained at around 180 mmol/L. Therefore, we changed the chemotherapy regimen to cytarabine 2.5 g every 12h on days 1, 3, and 5, and etoposide 100 mg on days 1-3 for 3 cycles. However, 3 days after the 5th cycle of the revised chemotherapy regimen, the patient presented with progressive generalized motor weakness and slurred speech, without headache and vomiting, and the patient couldn’t stand and walk without assistance. A routine blood test showed WBC 4×109/L, NEUT 3.84×109/L, HGB 94.3 g/L, and PLT 44×109/L. The patient’s liver function, serum ions, and other metabolic panels were within normal limits, except that the level of sCr was 157 mmol/L. Head CT and MRI did not show any new abnormal acute findings, and it was presumed that the neurologic symptoms experienced by the patient were a result of cytarabine neurotoxicity. Thereafter the patient was treated with prednisone 40 mg twice a day for 3 days, which led to a significant improvement in his symptoms. After recovering from the neurologic symptoms, the patient refused to continue chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patient was followed up on April 20, 2021 and he could speak fluently, but sometimes walked with an unsteady step. The size of the biggest lesion in the transplanted kidney decreased to 1.7 cm and the level of sCr was maintained at around 200mol/L.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [49, 'years'], 'creatinine': [200.0, 'mmol/L']}",0.009,0.009,0.009,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 49 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 200.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from mmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 200.0 mmol. To convert 200.0 mmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 200.0 mmol Serum Creatinine * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.2 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.2 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 22.624 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 22.624 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 22.624 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 22624.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22624.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 2262.4 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 200.0 mmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 2262.4 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (2262.4/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**49 * 1.0 = 0.009.

3556,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-6966219-1,Extracted,"A 16-year-old boy was referred for endoscopy due to severe IDA and recurrent hematochezia. He was noted to have mild intellectual disability at the level of elementary school but denied diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, or growth restriction. He initially denied hematochezia but later explained that he defecated feces stained with fresh blood 2 to 3 times a month for several years. His mother recalled that the patient had hematochezia at age 6 which led him to be misdiagnosed with hemorrhoids. The patient did not receive regular health care but visited the clinic for cellulitis treatment upon the diagnosis of IDA.
The patient had a height of 177.5 cm and a weight of 76.1 kg. His vital signs were stable and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Vascular engorgement was observed around the anus but no fissures were seen. A blood test showed a white blood cell count of 4,590/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 5.9 g/dL, a hematocrit of 23.2%, and a platelet count of 305,000/mm3. Mean corpuscular volume was determined to be 64.4 fL while ferritin level was at 3 ng/mL; these findings were suggestive of IDA. All other laboratory parameters were unremarkable.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge, dilated aberrant vein that drained both the splenic and left internal iliac veins (). This vein had developed most tortuously around the rectum. Congested small vessels around the rectum merged into the superior and middle rectal veins and drained into the left internal iliac vein. Additionally, the rectal mucosa showed prominent enhancement with associated thickening of the rectal walls. There was no evidence of arteriovenous malformations or fistulas. Doppler ultrasound of the liver demonstrated intact portal venous flow.
Colonoscopy was performed due to the suspicion of rectal varices based on the history and CT scan results. Colonoscopy showed numerous rectal polyps emerging up to 10 cm from the anus. Stalked or sessile polyps of various sizes were observed on the entire lumen of the rectum with some normal intervening mucosa. A few protruding vessels were identified. The polyp mucosa was covered with yellow-white fibrinous exudates and tortuous, dilated, superficial blood vessels were noted on their tips (). The entire colon and terminal ileum, except the rectum, were unremarkable. Biopsy specimens obtained from the tip of a polyp revealed diffused lymphocytic infiltration, crypt dilatation, mucinous infiltration of the crypt, and surface ulcerations (). These findings confirmed the cause of bleeding to be secondary to multiple rectal polyps.
Although the hugely dilated aberrant vein in the abdomen was considered a venous malformation, other abnormal findings were also noted in the systematic physical examination including subtle hypertrophy of the right upper extremity and light red-colored port wine stains on the trunk and the lateral aspect of the lower extremities (). Additionally, no prominent difference was observed in the thickness of the lower extremities despite macrodactyly on the right second toe. Taken together, the characteristic port wine stains, right upper extremity hypertrophy, and abdominal venous malformation meet the classic triad of KTS. Hence, KTS was diagnosed.
Various kinds of interventions, including radiologic and surgical treatment, were considered for the treatment of the abnormal abdominal vascularity found in this patient. However, his parents opted to postpone aggressive treatment, and he was therefore prescribed oral iron supplementation. The patient continues to have intermittent hematochezia but his hemoglobin level is maintained at 15.5 mg/dL with intermittent oral iron supplementation.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [177.5, 'cm']}",72.729,69.093,76.365,"The patient's gender is Male.

Ten days before admission, the patient had a tingling sensation in his left leg, from the posterior thigh to the foot. His spinal radiography findings were unspecified. Therefore, the patient was suspected as having a disc herniation, and observation was decided while continuing the medical treatment. Four days before admission, the patient had a tingling sensation that progressed in both legs. The symptoms did not improve, and motor weakness progressed below the ankle. In the physical examination at admission, motor power was grade 5 in the hip flexor and knee extensor in both lower extremities. However, it was grade 0 in the ankle dorsiflexor, and first toe extensor and flexor, and grades 4 and 0 in the ankle plantar flexor on the right and left sides, respectively. Sensory loss was not found in the L1 - L4 dermatomes, yet was 50% on the right side and 0% on the left side for the L5 and S1 dermatomes. He also had a heating sensation in his left foot and no knee-jerk reaction. He showed a weight loss of 6 kg during the last month, and the signal intensity of the bone marrow on L-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was diffusively reduced to be less than or equal to the disc. These findings indicated a hematologic disease and the possibility of malignancy with little preserved fat marrow. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse wall thickening of the gallbladder with some irregularity. However, the bone marrow biopsy slides showed a generally hyper-cellular (50% to 60%) marrow for the patient’s age, with small hypo-cellular regions (0% to 20%). On aspirate smears, the eosinophil counts were markedly increased, with expanded eosinophil myelocytes and metamyelocytes. The results of the pulmonary function tests showed an obstructive pattern, such as a forced vital capacity of 54%, a forced expiratory volume in one second of 46%, and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 70% of 33% of the predicted values. The findings from a nerve conduction study suggested multiple mono-neuropathies. In addition, his laboratory findings showed peripheral eosinophilia and positivity for myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (MPO-ANCA; ). Therefore, CSS was strongly suspected, and steroid and cyclophosphamide therapies were started after nerve biopsy under spinal anesthesia. At that time, the symptoms were progressing to the left wrist drop and both legs. However, nerve biopsy results were consistent with demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. The patient underwent cholecystectomy under general anesthesia to exclude gallbladder cancer, suspected on the basis of CT findings, and pathological confirmation was possible with a gallbladder specimen ().","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [175.8, 'cm']}",71.19,67.63,74.749,"The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 175.8 cm, which is 175.8 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 69.213 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (69.213 (in inches) - 60) = 71.19 kg.

An awake craniotomy was planned. Preoperative routine laboratory tests did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient had no problems with cognition or communication but complained of intermittent headaches with a visual analog score of 3–5. During the preoperative assessment, he was fully cooperative and understood the surgical and anesthetic (asleepawake-asleep technique) procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hyperintense lesion in the left temporal pole and insula, suggesting the progression of a recurrent tumor. Computer tomography (CT) scans of the brain and skull radiography showed a bony cleft that was 2 mm wide in the left half of the skull (). Two hours prior to surgery, 1.5 g 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was ingested on neurosurgeon’s instructions. Upon entering the operating room, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiogram monitoring were applied. An arterial catheter was inserted under local anesthesia for direct blood pressure measurements. The blood pressure and pulse rate were 124/62 mmHg and 57 beats/min, respectively. Following the intravenous administration of 50 μg fentanyl, the scalp nerve block and a ring block in the left hemisphere were performed over 30 minutes using a 25-gauge × 40 mm needle at the supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal, greater occipital, and lesser occipital nerves. A local anesthetic mixture of 60 ml (20 ml 2% lidocaine, 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine, and 20 ml normal saline with 1 : 200,000 epinephrine) was used. The patient tolerated the scalp nerve block with no evidence of intravascular injection.
Approximately 15 minutes after block completion, the seizure occurred initially with a sudden move up his trunk, followed by trembling of both extremities for 10 seconds. His mentality became stupor with dilated (7–8 mm) pupils without light reflex. The blood pressure and heart rate were 167/81 mmHg and 78 beats/min, respectively, with sinus rhythm and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Although the seizure subsided spontaneously, the patient remained in a stupor with dilated and fixed pupils (right: 7 mm; left: 8 mm) with no light reflex. The operation was postponed, as it was decided that proceeding with the awake craniotomy would not be feasible, and emergency CT was conducted in order to investigate the cause of the seizures. When the scan was completed after 15 minutes, the patient remained drowsy but could respond briskly to verbal commands. His pupils were anisocoric (right: 4 mm; left: 8 mm) with light reflex. The CT scan showed a localized fluid collection and small intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) near the temporoparietal cortex beneath the skull defect ( and ). At 30 minutes after the seizure, he continued to remain drowsy but could respond to verbal commands. Pupils were asymmetric but responded well to light. At 55 minutes after the seizure, he fully recovered without neurological sequelae but could not recall the incident. He had a muscle power of 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities and a Glasgow coma scale score of 15. His pupils were isocoric (2 mm) with prompt light reflex. Prior to this, the patient had not complained of nausea, dizziness, or perioral numbness.
After being closely monitored for 1 hour and 20 minutes in the postanesthetic care unit, the patient was transferred to the neurosurgical care unit (NCU) for 6 hours and 40 minutes. Since no hemodynamic or neurological deterioration was observed, the patient was moved to an operating room, where he underwent the surgery for 7 hours and 30 minutes under general anesthesia. The lungs were extubated in the NCU 1.5 hours after the operation. He was transferred to the general ward on post-operative day 2 and released from the hospital on post-operative day 10.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

His social history was notable for a 60 pack-year cigarette smoking, and he had cut down to five cigarettes a day after diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). He denied any significant past alcohol abuse, illicit drug abuse, or prescription drug abuse and reported consuming a beer or two on rare social occasions. Our patient was adopted so he is unaware of any past family history in regard to his parents. His brother has high blood pressure; otherwise he reported no other known malignancy or cardiopulmonary disease in the family. He worked as a mechanic and retired 20 years ago. He denied any known environmental exposures or allergies. Home medications included a daily probiotic, florastor 250 mg 2 tablets once daily, and acetaminophen/oxycodone – 325 mg/5 tablets once a day as needed for severe back pain. Our patient explained that he took opiate pain medication two to three times a week. Seven years prior, a bone marrow (BM) biopsy had revealed DLBCL, stage IVB, and he achieved complete remission (CR) with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (R-CHOP). Two years prior, he was diagnosed with monoclonal IgM kappa MGUS and BM biopsy revealed B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation (10% of the marrow cellularity). The differential diagnosis at this time included LPL and marginal zone lymphoma. Given that he was asymptomatic at this time, he was monitored without treatment.
In the Emergency Department (ED), his vital signs were a pulse of 88 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 145/62, and temperature was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit. His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air and he was mildly tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. At physical examination, he appeared well, he was well nourished, awake, and in no apparent distress. An ear, nose, mouth and throat examination showed clear nasal mucosa and normal mouth mucosa. His head was atraumatic/normocephalic. His heart rate was normal, with a regular rhythm, heart sounds were S1, S2, and there were no murmurs, rubs or gallops. There were rales in his left lung base without wheeze or rhonchi. His abdomen was soft, non-distended, and non-tender. His lumbar spine showed a mild reduction in range of motion. He showed superficial bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was alert and oriented × 4, with no focal deficits, and no motor or sensory deficits. His CN II-XII were intact, extremities showed no cyanosis or edema, and his skin was dry, intact, with no rash. Our patient was given one ipratropium bromide/albuterol nebulizer treatment and two doses of morphine 1 mg for back pain. During the admission, our patient received tramadol 50 mg once for back pain and required no other medication. His complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 6.2 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, platelet count of 156 × 109/L with normal differential. The complete metabolic panel showed sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 18 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 95 mg/dL, calcium of 9.2, albumin 3.8 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 23 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase of 32 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase of 46, and total bilirubin of 0.6. The urinalysis was within normal limits with no evidence of hematuria, pyuria, nitrates were not detected, and there were no bacteria. A computed tomography scan of his chest (Fig. ), abdomen, and pelvis showed layering left pleural effusion and para-aortic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extending to the iliacs and superficial inguinal nodes. Pleural fluid (PF) cytology was positive for malignant cells consistent with B-cell lymphoma and positive for MYD88 L265P mutation.
PF flow cytometry showed monoclonal kappa B-cell population with moderate CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD38 expression (Fig. ).
Inguinal lymph node biopsy showed lymphoplasmacytic, monoclonal B-cell population, CD20-positive, CD5-negative, CD10-negative B-cells, consistent with LPL/WM (Fig. ).
In comparison to his BM biopsy 2 years prior, the current study shows an increase in marrow involvement by B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation. The findings in conjunction with IgM monoclonal paraprotein favor LPL, and the positive MYD88 L265P mutation analysis supports this impression. Congo red stain was negative for amyloid (Fig. ).
The pleural effusion recurred post-thoracentesis and 420 mg ibrutinib was initiated, but due to intolerance with nausea and vomiting, required a dose reduction to 240 mg.

The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 18.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 95.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 141.0 + (18.0 / 2.8) + (18.0 / 18) = 293.706 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 293.706 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 293.706 mOsm/kg."

Physical examination revealed a systolic mitral murmur and a diastolic aortic murmur. No dyskinesia or paresthesia was detected. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a noncoronary SVA projecting into the mitral anterior leaflet, leading to moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic insufficiency, combined with a dilated aortic root. The ascending aorta measured 54-mm, and the left ventricular diastolic diameter was 75-mm, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 66%. No ventricular septal defect was detected. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed that there were no abnormalities or stenoses found in the coronary tree, and that the sac of the noncoronary SVA (measuring 36 × 47 × 51 mm) was protruding into the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (Fig. A and B).
Surgery was performed via median sternotomy. Considering the marked dilation of the ascending aorta, we established cardiopulmonary bypass via right formal artery-bicaval cannulation. The ascending aorta was not adhered to the pericardium, and was clamped proximal to the dilated part. Close examination of the tricuspid aortic valve and ascending aortic wall revealed the thickening of the wall, indicating inflammation. The unruptured sac of the noncoronary SVA was protruding downwards into the body of the mitral anterior leaflet, and contained a thrombus mass. After excision of the tricuspid mitral valve and the aneurysm and removal of the thrombus (Fig. A), the mitral valve apparatus could be clearly observed through the aortic annulus. Mitral valve replacement was performed via the transaortic approach. We excised the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve, and reconstructed the mitral annulus with a patch (Chest.Co, Shanghai, China). A Sorin mechanical valve (27 mm, Sorin Group, Italia) was implanted using interrupted mattress sutures (Fig. B). The aortic valve was replaced with a Sorin mechanical valve (23 mm, Sorin Group, Italia), and the ascending aorta was replaced with an artificial vessel (IGW0028-15, La Ciotat, France). The proximal end of the artificial vessel was located 5 mm above the ostium of the right coronary artery, and the distal end was located at the proximal part of the brachiocephalic trunk artery. The artificial vessel was enveloped by the intrinsic aortic wall.
Pathological examination of the aortic and mitral valves using hematoxylin/eosin staining demonstrated that mucoid degeneration, abscess formation, and substantial infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. A). Antibiotics were administered for 5 weeks. The postoperative course was uneventful. Follow-up TTE showed satisfactory functioning of both replaced valves. Aortic CTA demonstrated the restoration of the normal anatomical relationship at the aortic root (Fig. B).",What is the patient's body surface area?

The mother has a healthy 6-year-old girl but also had a spontaneous abortion and an artificial abortion due to embryo death. The mother's brother had a history of epilepsy and had passed away.
The infant's birth weight, head circumference, and length were 2,830 g (10–25th percentile), 33 cm (25–50th percentile), and 48 cm (10–25th percentile), respectively, with a normal Apgar score. However, she had mild blepharoptosis and there was a 3 cm cleft palate from the palate to the uvula. On day of life (DOL) 2, the infant vomited milk twice accompanied by weakness in sucking. A few hours later, she went into convulsions that involved rowing movements of the limbs. Her blood glucose was 0.7 mmol/L and blood gas analysis revealed anion gap metabolic acidosis (24.69 mmol/L). After providing glucose (8 mg/kg/min) and phenobarbital (10 mg/kg) injection treatment, the convulsions did not occur again, but she became somnolent, developed an unexplained abnormal liver function, and an aggravating increase in serum lactate (16.4 mmol/L). The infant was immediately transferred to our tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) center on DOL 3 for further newborn care.
The infant's serum lactate was normal on DOL 4 after giving intravenous fluids and nasogastric feeding. Blood glucose was normal on DOL 6 without intravenous fluids. The problems during hospitalization were poor neonatal sucking, reduced movements, and unexplained elevated liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 1,373 mmol/L, total bile acids (TBA) 58.2 μmol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 132 U/L,prothrombin time (PT) 46.1s, albumin 26.57 g/L) with normal stool color and abdominal ultrasound. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high signals on T2 and FLAIR, where the lenticular nucleus was swollen on both sides. There were multiple hyperintensity patches on the dorsal side of the brainstem and posterior limb of the internal capsule near the anterior and posterior horns of the right lateral ventricle (). Evoked otoacoustic emission test was not passed on both ears.
Blood tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) showed an increase in tyrosine 227.85 μM (25–225 μM). Urine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) showed an increase in oxalate 57.78 (0–33), 3-methylglutaconic aciduria 4.35 (0–1), and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactic acid 1122.49 (0–20). Next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing detected two compound heterozygotes of SERAC1 (c.1502-1G>C(likely pathogenic) from the maternal side, c.227-228dupAT(pathogenic) from the paternal side) and a de novo variant of SATB2 (c.1166G>A) (likely pathogenic) (). The quality control of WES data analysis and procedure of variant annotation refers to pipeline version 2 of Children's Hospital of Fudan University (). We classified the pathogenicity of the identified variants according to the ACMG guideline, the details showed in ().
On DOL 17, the infant was discharged from hospital with a nasogastric tube. After symptomatic treatment, the high GGT at admission had dropped to 264 mmol/L and the PT returned to normal (16.2 s). She experienced slow weight gain and increasing TBA, which was unmanageable by drugs after discharge. When she was 3 months old, there was a continuous mild increase in methionine (Met) for 2 months. After providing Met-free formula milk, the level of Met reduced to normal, and her motor development improved. When she was 12 months old, she had a high fever of 39°C. Afterward, her gross and fine motor regressed to the level of 5 months. Now, she is 15 months old with four primary teeth and has completed a cleft palate repair surgery in order to improve her nutritional status. When she was discharged from the hospital in the first time, the GGT were maintained between 430 and 470 mmol/L, the AST were maintained between 62 and 87 U/L and albumin were maintained between 31.4 and 36.9 g/L. In addition, PT (15.1 s) and international normalized ratio (1.31) was slightly elevated at 12 months of age. Only bile acids were continuously increasing. Because she had normal stool color, normal skin color, and normal abdominal ultrasound, we excluded the extrahepatic biliary atresia and choledochal cyst and did not perform liver biopsy.

him for TAVI. Computed tomography and angiography showed ASH with a moderately calcified
aortic valve, mild LVOT calcifications (), and an accessible femoral route.
The TAVI procedure was performed with a 26 mm Sapien 3 bioprosthetic valve (Edwards
Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). The initial result was acceptable, with no PVL nor coronary
obstruction. We noticed an upward movement of the valve during implantation (). There was no pre- nor post-dilations required. No
electrical or access site complications were encountered. The patient was transferred to the

He had no known history of psychosis prior to admission to the hospital. His social history was positive for alcohol consumption (25 mL a day for 10 years) and smoking (40 cigarettes a day for 30 years).
On admission, the patient was conscious and oriented to person, time, and place. Complete neurological examination including mental state was normal. The patient was in shortness of breath with the following vital signs: temperature 36.2 °C, blood pressure 156/91 mmHg, pulse 98 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. He reported progressively worsening cough productive of yellow purulent sputum. Bilateral moist crackles were heard in both lungs on auscultation but with no wheezing. Markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (white blood cell count [WBC] 10.25 × 103/μL, C-reactive protein [CRP] 57.50 mg/L, procalcitonin [PCT] 0.49 ng/mL). Laboratory analysis revealed increased baseline serum creatinine (10.63 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 4.94 mL/min). His liver function was moderately impaired and classified into Child-Pugh class B. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse inflammation and interstitial change and a small amount of pleural effusion in bilateral lungs.
Intravenous moxifloxacin was initiated 400 mg daily as empiric treatment for pulmonary infection on hospital day 1. A sputum sample was collected for microbiological culture before initiation of antibiotics and the result came back negative. On day 12, the patient was feeling tired and weak with hyperthemia (38.1 °C), hypertension (184/91 mm Hg), and worsened shortness of breath (26 beats/min). Plasma indicators for infection were elevated (WBC 11.50 × 109/L, neutrophils 97.1%, PCT 22.10 ng/mL). On the 13th day, moxifloxacin was switched to meropenem 500 mg intravenous every 8 hours. On 16th day, sputum culture revealed multidrug-resistant (MDR) A baumannii (resistant to carbapenem but sensitive to tetracycline). Then intraveous tigecycline was added to the regimen at a loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours.
Fourteen hours after tigecycline initiation, the patient became confused, disoriented to location, and the time. He had difficulty understanding instructions and was clearly disturbed in attention during the conversation. He was agitated, fearing that people around him were trying to harm him. Then he became verbally aggressive toward his family members and medical staff. His mental disorder worsened in the next 2 to 3 hours then he began having hallucinations, seeing a huge ball in the ceiling and asking the nurse to take it down so he could eat it. He asked other people to gather together and said he had important things to announce. His Confusion Assessment Method, which is a valid tool for the detection of delirium, was negative prior to the initiation of tigecycline, but became positive after it was started. His clinical manifestations also met the key features listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) criteria from the American Psychiatric Association that characterizes delirium.[
No focal neurological disease was noted after neurological examination. A computerized tomographic scan of the head was then performed, and no abnormalities were identified. Oxygen supplementation (4 L/min via nasal cannulae) was initiated after the arterial blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia (pH 7.41; PaCO2 25 mmHg; PaO2 68 mmHg; Na+ 132 mEq/L; K+ 5.5 mEq/L). The patient did not have any prior history of mental illness. Drug-induced delirium was suspected and tigecycline was speculated to be the most likely offending agent after medication review (Table ). Since his delirium was treated with little success with olanzapine, tigecycline therapy was discontinued the next morning after the patient stayed awake the whole night. During the following day after discontinuation of tigecyline, the patient's mental state improved and delirium cleared slowly. He restored the ability of focus and orientation. Perceptual disturbances disappeared, and no visual illusions or vague delusions of harm were noted again.
Meanwhile, markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (WBC 43.91 × 109/L, neutrophils 98.2%, PCT 34.04 ng/mL, CRP 89.09 mg/L). On Day 19, antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem (i.v., 500 mg q8 h) combined with minocycline (p.o., 400 mg q12 h), and amikacin (i.v., 200 mg qd). The regimen continued for 5 days but the patient did not respond well, showing even higher systemic inflammation markers and exacerbated dyspnea. Antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem 500 mg every 8 hours, and he started again on tigecycline 50 mg every 12 hours on 24th day with no loading dose.
In the morning of Day 25, the patient showed reduced psychomotor activity, decreased speech, but no obvious hallucinations. He had no idea of the time of day, nor where he was, although the day before he was fully orientated. The patient experienced a hypoactive state of delirium. CT examination of the chest showed increased inflammatory pulmonary lesions in bilateral lungs. Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia without carbon dioxide retention, and the electrolytes were found to be within range. Also, no significant changes in blood profile like levels of liver enzymes or serum creatinine was observed compared with the last test taken before the delirium appeared again. Tigecycline was discontinued and delirium resolved in the afternoon. Antibiotic treatment was then switched to levofloxacin (i.v., 600 mg qd) and minocycline (p.o., 100 mg q12 h). But the patient did not respond well to the present antibiotic therapy and his dyspnea exacerbated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit 6 days later as mechanical ventilation was required. Unfortunately, the patient died of recurrent attacks of left heart failure probably caused by uncontrolled serious infections on 33th day.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [77, 'years'], 'creatinine': [10.63, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",4.545,4.318,4.772,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

The patient is 77 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 10.63 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.

312,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-5137935-1,Extracted,"A 47-year-old Hispanic male presented to our emergency department with severe neck pain. He has had intermittent episodes of neck pain with radiation down his spine and lower extremities for the past year. It was described as a sharp and sometimes cramping, 8–10/10 in intensity, intermittent and was triggered by activity like lifting heavy objects. Two weeks prior to admission he was evaluated at a local clinic for the same complaints, treated with ibuprofen and referred to our rheumatology clinic where a workup was in progress.
His pain became more intense prompting him to seek medical attention and was admitted to our hospital for evaluation. He noted that he had been more fatigued lately with generalized malaise. He had difficulty climbing stairs and moving from a sitting to a standing position but was able to eat with a fork/spoon and comb his hair without any difficulty. He reported that his fingers turned blue on exposure to cold weather. He occasionally had joint pains with swelling and redness of multiple joints, associated with morning stiffness lasting at least 30 min. He also reported noticing frothy urine for the past year.
His past medical history was significant for hypothyroidism and hypertension. His medications consisted of lisinopril, aspirin and levothyroxine. He had no allergies. He denied any family history of thyroid, autoimmune or rheumatological diseases. He was a landscaper by profession. He denied smoking cigarettes, alcohol use or illicit drug use.
On examination, he was a young Hispanic male in some distress from the neck pain. He had unremarkable vital signs with a BMI of 25. His physical examination was normal. X-rays of his chest and spine were normal. His blood work revealed anemia with hemoglobin of 11 g/dl, marked hypoalbuminemia of 1.7 g/dl and a total protein of 3.6 mg/dl. He had a blood urea nitrogen of 33 mg/dl and serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dl. His triglycerides were elevated at 265 mg/dl, cholesterol of 209 mg/dl and a calculated LDL of 132 mg/dl. His previous blood work done a few days ago at our rheumatology clinic showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 53 mm/h, TSH 10.6 and free T4 1.27 ng/ml. A urinalysis showed 1+ blood with 9 RBC, hyaline and granular casts but no RBC casts, protein of greater than 600 mg/dl with a urine protein-creatinine ratio of 4 grams/gram of creatinine. HIV, hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. Antinuclear antibody was positive with a titer of 1:640 and a peripheral pattern.
A nephrologist and a rheumatologist were consulted. Given normal renal function, microscopic hematuria and massive proteinuria, membranous nephropathy secondary to SLE was suspected. Further workup revealed a low C3 of 76 mg/dl, a normal C4 of 36 mg/dl and the anti-dsDNA titer was positive at 29 IU/ml. Renal biopsy was done and it revealed immune-complex-mediated diffuse segmental proliferative and membranous nephritis with features of focal cellular and fibrocellular crescents (8–10%). The segmental active glomerular lesions were in approximately 79–83% of sampled glomeruli, which were characterized by segmental endocapillary hypercellularity, hyaline ‘pseudothrombi’ (intraluminal immune aggregates), duplication of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and, cellular and fibrocellular crescent. There was no significant tubulointerstitial chronic injury. The biopsy was diagnostic for lupus nephritis class IV-S (A/C) and V by ISN/RPS 2004 classification (). He was started on prednisone, hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil. Four months after initiating therapy he started to show improvement in his proteinuria. He continues to have a normal renal function ().","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [47, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.0, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",93.418,88.747,98.089,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

40,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-8022680-1,Extracted,"A 185-cm, 75-kg, 46-year-old man with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3 and a 15 pack-year history of smoking as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting, cannabis use, and gastroesophageal reflux presented for median sternotomy with open resection of a left-sided, biopsy-proven 13.1 × 9.4 × 4.5-cm type B-1 thymoma with distal tracheal deviation (Figures , ). The patient had initially presented with unrelated symptoms that led to a chest X-ray. This incidentally revealed the mediastinal mass, which was subsequently further evaluated. The patient had no family history of muscular dystrophies or electrolyte abnormalities. Although the original frozen section was read as lymphoma, final cytology confirmed thymic origin.
On the morning of the surgery, the patient denied dyspnea, orthopnea, double vision, difficulties chewing, speaking, or swallowing, or peripheral muscle weakness. Airway examination revealed a Mallampati IV classification with appropriate mouth opening and prognathism without restriction of neck movement. No stridor was appreciated in the sitting or supine position.
After discussion with the procedural team about vessels at risk for surgical sacrifice, a 20-G left radial arterial catheter was placed preoperatively using local anesthesia. Preoperative arterial blood gas (ABG) and other laboratory studies showed no significant abnormalities, preserved renal function with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate, a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, a serum blood urea nitrogen of 14 mg/dL, and a serum potassium of 4.5 mmol/L.
Anxiolysis was achieved using midazolam, and the patient was induced with intravenous ketamine combined with sevoflurane via a nasal continuous positive airway pressure device (SuperNO2VATM; Vyaire Medical, Mettawa, IL, USA), ensuring preservation of spontaneous ventilation. A 20-mg bolus of intravenous propofol was administered to facilitate placement of a size 4 igelⓇ supraglottic airway (Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, Berkshire, UK). Bronchoscopy was performed through the supraglottic airway to obtain visualization of the left main bronchus and secondary carina. Propofol was incrementally titrated until spontaneous ventilation was temporarily halted and capacity to provide adequate positive pressure ventilation was ensured. Reassuring bronchoscopy findings and ventilation allowed titration of rocuronium and uneventful placement of a left-sided 37-French, double-lumen endotracheal tube via direct laryngoscopy. Appropriate positioning was confirmed under bronchoscopic visualization.
The surgical resection was technically challenging given local tumor invasion into the left lung parenchyma as well as bilateral mediastinal parietal pleura. The resection required significant tumor manipulation, and the left phrenic nerve could not be spared by the cardiothoracic surgeons (Figure ). To help improve surgical conditions, intermittent alternating left and right lung isolation was required. The patient tolerated this well without significant desaturation. Hypercarbia levels were maintained within acceptable ranges anticipated for one-lung ventilation, especially compared to thoracoscopically assisted cases with carbon dioxide insufflation.
After considerable tumor manipulation requiring intermittent breath holds, an intraoperative ABG was obtained to assess oxygenation and ventilation status, revealing a potassium of 6.5 mmol/L. To confirm this value, another ABG drawn by a different physician showed a potassium of 6.2 mmol/L. In an effort to remove further confounding factors, a different anesthesia technician ran a third confirmatory ABG that returned a potassium of 6.1 mmol/L, a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 56 mmHg, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, bicarbonate of 24.7 mmol/L, a base deficit of 2.4 mmol/L, a sodium of 133 mmol/L, a chloride of 107 mmol/L, ionized calcium of 1.09 mmol/L, and a glucose of 133 mg/dL (Table ). T-waves were not peaked, and there were no other notable abnormalities on electrocardiogram.
The patient was given 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate and 6 g of calcium gluconate over 45 min. A five-unit bolus of insulin was administered intravenously with 12.5 g of dextrose, and an insulin infusion was started at 2 units/hour and titrated up to 5 units/hour. Given frequent one-lung ventilation and intermittent respiratory cessation, β-agonist therapy and hyperventilation were deferred. Diuretic therapy was avoided given implementation of other therapies, adequate urine production, and a lack of electrocardiographic changes or other symptoms. The patient’s potassium level improved to 5.2 mmol/L by the end of the procedure without evidence of hypoglycemia, and he produced 800 mL of urine. The patient’s temperature was 36.4°C at the beginning, 36.1°C during, and 37.1°C at the end of the surgery. After successful conclusion of the procedure, the patient’s respiratory mechanics were evaluated using negative inspiratory force and rapid shallow breathing index, and he was extubated uneventfully and transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient did not experience any further hyperkalemia during his hospital stay and was discharged on postoperative day 3. At follow-up, the patient expressed appreciation for the care he received.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [46, 'years'], 'weight': [75.0, 'kg'], 'height': [185.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [1.0, 'mg/dL']}",97.917,93.021,102.813,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 46 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 185.0 cm, which is 185.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.85 m. The patient's weight is 75.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 75.0 kg / (1.85 m * 1.85 m) = 21.914 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 21.9, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 75.0 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 46) * 75.0 * 1) / (1.0 * 72) = 97.917 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 97.917 mL/min."

4978,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-7888275-1,Extracted,"A male infant was born to a 30-years-old mother with no significant medical history (gravida 0, para 0, abortus 0) who became pregnant via natural insemination. At 23 weeks of gestation, the mother was referred to our hospital because of severe fetal growth restriction caused by utero-placental insufficiency and was treated with antenatal steroids. Fetal maturity was ascertained by calculating from the mother's last menstrual period and was confirmed by prenatal ultrasound. Prenatal counseling was conducted for the parents, and they requested to give birth by cesarean section. At 24 weeks and 0 days of gestation, the infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of interrupted blood flow in the umbilical cord; there was no umbilical cord coiling or amniotic fluid staining. The weight of the placenta was 60 g. Placental pathology revealed infarction. No findings of chorioamnionitis were observed. Immediately after birth, he was wrapped using a plastic bag on a prewarmed radiant warmer. The ambient temperature of the operating room was set to 27°C (). He was intubated in the operation room with a 2-mm endotracheal tube and transferred to the NICU in an incubator. The admission temperature at the axilla was 35.8°C. The humidity in the incubator was set at 90% on day 0 in order to reduce insensible water loss, and it was lowered by 5% daily to 60% (). His Apgar score was 2 at 1 min after birth, 6 at 5 min, and 6 at 10 min. Apart from his size, his physical examination and laboratory test results were unremarkable. Postnatal maturation assessment was adequate for a preterm infant born at 24 weeks of gestation. Genetic disorders were ruled out as a cause of intrauterine growth restriction based on the findings of physical examination and ultrasonography and the results of blood examination including blood gas, complete blood count, and biochemistry. Hence, genetic testing was not performed. His birth weight was 268 g (−3.92 SD). In order to prioritize stabilization, his head circumference and length were not measured at birth; when they were measured for the first time on postnatal day 16 (postmenstrual age 26 weeks, 2 days), his head circumference was 18.5 cm (−3.03 SD) and his length was 24.0 cm (−3.7 SD). On arrival to the NICU, he was placed on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation because of low pulmonary compliance, and a surfactant was administered on days 0 and 2. Sedation was not performed. Anhydrous caffeine was started from day 0. Prophylactic antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, and fosfluconazole) were administered after birth and continued until day 6. Because the umbilical artery was narrow, an umbilical artery catheter could not be inserted. The infant's blood pressure was measured after birth via a 24G peripheral arterial catheter to avoid the risk of damage that a cuff would pose to his immature skin and was the approximate value expected for his gestational age; thus, no inotropes were administered. After the catheter occluded on day 8, we assessed his blood pressure mainly by physical examination. The target ranges of osmotic agents were set with reference to previous studies, and his albumin level was kept above 2.5 g/dL to maintain osmotic pressure (–). Echocardiography was performed to diagnose patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on day 1. We administered 0.1 mg/kg per dose of indomethacin, because echocardiography represented an increased shunt volume of PDA (, ). PDA closed after indomethacin administration on day 1. He required 45 days of mechanical ventilation, including 40 days of high-frequency oscillation (). He was extubated on day 45 (30 weeks and 3 days of postmenstrual day) when we confirmed that the prongs of our continuous positive airway pressure machine fit his nose. His body weight when measured after extubation was 518 g on day 51 (31 weeks and 2 days of postmenstrual day). From day 42, he received a systemic steroid (dexamethasone) for 10 days, as advised by Doyle et al. (). After successful extubation, he required nasal continuous positive airway pressure for 7 days and a high-flow nasal cannula for 116 days. Target SpO2 was set at 85–95% before 34 weeks of postmenstrual age and above 95% afterward.
Parenteral nutrition was started on day 0 via an 18G umbilical venous catheter. After this catheter became occluded on day 12, a 27G peripherally inserted central venous catheter was used, but it also became occluded on day 19. From then on, parenteral nutrition was continued via a peripheral venous catheter. On day 1, oral administration of the mother's breast milk using a cotton swab was performed by the parents, and trophic feeding via nasogastric tube was started. A maximum of 3 mL/kg of 5-fold-diluted amidotrizoic acid was rectally administered for 1 week starting on day 1, resulting in successful defecation. After 3 days of trophic feeds, enteral feeding was stopped because the infant's abdomen was gradually becoming distended. His daily abdominal X-ray indicated significantly expanding intestinal gas, and we diagnosed him with meconium-related ileus. Intragastric administration of 3 mL/kg 5-fold-diluted amidotrizoic acid succeeded in triggering mass excretion of feces, as described in previous studies (–). Subsequently, abdominal distention improved, and enteral feeding was resumed. Fortified breast milk was used from day 20 when the infant's breast milk consumption reached 100 mL/kg per day. We maintained him on a breast milk diet for most of his hospital stay, adding medium-chain triglyceride oil from day 94 to 133 for calorie enrichment. The calorie goal was set at 120–140 kcal/kg/day. Oral feeding was initiated on day 98, and the gastric tube was removed on day 137. During the treatment, blood glucose was managed within the reference range with glucose administration and enteral feeding only, except for insulin administration at day 1 and from day 5 to 6. Fluid intake was determined from vital signs and physical findings, fluid balance, and blood test results. Fluid intake was relatively restricted in expectation of reducing risk of morbidities and complications (). Transepidermal water loss was estimated based on the sodium levels, fluid intake, urine output, and previous reports (). Total fluid volume administered on day 0 was 65 mL/kg; for most of the period after the patient stabilized, it was maintained between 130 and 160 mL/kg per day. Minimal handling was conducted in all aspects of the patient's management. As described above, anthropometric measurements were kept to a minimum, and our patient's weight was estimated from fluids and nutritional balance and was adjusted on the day it was measured. After his first weighing on day 0, he was not weighed again until day 30 to confirm the anticipated growth. His body weight, length, and head circumference were measured every 2 weeks after that. Until day 42, we kept him in a prone position without postural change, aiming to prevent both gastroesophageal reflux and unplanned extubation. During that period, we undertook careful skin management, making sure to give him proper support to prevent bedsores. Although minimizing postural change may increase the risk of skin and pulmonary infection, there were only two events after the day of birth when we had to administer antibiotics: from day 38 to 45 for suspected aspiration pneumonia and from day 66 to 76 for cellulitis due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus at the site of the removed peripheral catheter. Blood sampling was also minimized to reduce the frequency of painful procedures and the risk of iatrogenic anemia. For a month after birth, heel sticks were performed as little as once per day to analyze blood gas, electrolytes, metabolic factors (glucose, lactate), and biochemical factors (albumin, phosphate, C-reactive protein). We performed a comprehensive blood examination (complete blood count and biochemical tests) only once every week or two ().
In addition to minimal handling, we encouraged parental involvement from the day of birth. Shortly after the infant was born, the family began to talk to him and hold him. The parents frequently visited our NICU to engage in physical contact with him, including breastfeeding, which was performed from day 1 ().
Magnetic resonance imaging of the head at 45 weeks of postmenstrual age revealed no detectable abnormalities. An automated auditory brainstem response test was bilaterally passed. However, the infant developed bilateral retinopathy of prematurity (stages 2–3), requiring laser treatment. He was discharged from the hospital on day 176 (postmenstrual age, 49 weeks and 1 day) without any requirement for home oxygen therapy or tube feeding. His body weight at discharge was 3,238 g (−3.41 SD), his head circumference was 35.5 cm (−1.31 SD), and his length was 46.8 cm (−4.55 SD) () (). The patient's mother said that she could only say how happy she was that he had grown so much.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [268.0, 'g']}",1.072,1.018,1.126,"The patient's weight is 268.0 g so this converts to 268.0 lbs * kg/1000 g = 0.268 kg.

Hence, the patient's maintenance fluid is 0.268 kg * 4 mL/kg/hr = 1.072 mL/hr.
Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 1.072 mL/hr."

5454,26,Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-3583052-1,Extracted,"A 21-day-old white male presented to the primary pediatrician for poor feeding, who noted that he had not regained his birth weight. Electrolytes were ordered as part of a failure to thrive workup, which revealed a sodium of 106 mmol/L, a potassium of 7.1 mmol/L, and a glucose of 1.8 mmol/L. After having a 17-OH progesterone level drawn, the infant was transferred to our tertiary referral hospital for electrolyte derangements with the presumptive diagnosis of salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Birth history was significant for an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. Birth length was 51 cm (65th Percentile). Birth weight was 3.35 kg (37th percentile). Apgar scores were 8 and 9. Hyperpigmentation of the scrotum was noted at birth. Hypoglycemia was noted on the first day of life. He was discharged on the second day of life.
The past medical history was significant for two previous admissions for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin of 367 μmol/L.He was treated with phototherapy on both occasions. His parents noted that his skin seemed to be progressively more pigmented over the first three weeks of life. This “bronzing” was attributed to phototherapy.
Physical exam upon arrival revealed normal vital signs and a blood pressure of 68/33 mmHg. His weight was 3.1 kg (7th Percentile). No dysmorphic features were noted. Genital exam revealed normal male genitalia with both testes descended. Phallus was normal in length and caliber with the urethral meatus at the tip. Physical exam was remarkable for marked bronzing of the skin.
Once in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient was started on fludrocortisone and intravenous fluid support. He underwent a high-dose ACTH stimulation test and then was begun on glucocorticoid treatment at an initial dose of 28 mg/m2/day. Severe hyponatremia persisted despite the administration of 400 mcg/day of fludrocortisone in addition to 20 mEq/kg/day of sodium chloride. Diarrhea ensued. Escalating doses of glucocorticoid up to 54 mg/m2 were used. By the age of 5 months, he was weaned off of salt supplementation, and hydrocortisone doses were weaned to physiologic levels. Fludrocortisone doses have been gradually reduced.
The11-deoxycortisol values of theACTH stimulation became available early in this hospitalization and were consistent with 11β-hydroxylase deficiency with markedly elevated baseline and stimulated levels of 11-deoxycortisol (see ). The 17-hydroxyprogesterone obtained from his primary care physician returned at5.6 pmol/L (normal up to 2.9 pmol/L). As 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 11-deoxycortisol have been reported to be elevated in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and because salt wasting does not occur in 11-hydroxylase deficiency, 21-hydroxylase deficiency remained the presumptive diagnosis. The following day the baseline and stimulated 17-hydoxy progesterone levels returned to normal levels (4.5 nmol/L), arguing against 21-hydroxylase deficiency. He was evaluated for possible 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. A repeat 11-deoxycortisol after 12 days of hydrocortisone treatment returned to 1.49 nmol/L (normal range <.346–4.5).
Genetic testing was sent for CYP11B1 gene. The coding exons and the flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced in forward and reverse directions, using automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing methods and the mRNA isoform NM_000497 as the reference sequence.
Genetic testing was also performed for the DAX1 (NROB1) gene associated with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia. The coding exons and the flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced in forward and reverse directions, using automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing methods and the NCBI reference files U31929.Gbk (DAX1, mRNA) and NM_000475.Gbk (NROB1, mRNA) as the reference sequences. This testing was positive for a new missense mutation not previously described. A T to C base change in the second exon was found, which substitutes proline for leucine at codon 447. His mother tested positive as a carrier for this gene. He has two older male siblings who have undergone genetic testing and have been found to be unaffected.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [1.8, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [106.0, 'mmol/L']}",104.464,99.241,109.687,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 106.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 106.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 106.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 106.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 106.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 106.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 1.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 1.8 mmol. To convert 1.8 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.8 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.36 g glucose. To convert 0.36 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.36 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 360.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 360.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 36.0 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 1.8 mmol glucose/L converts to 36.0 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 106.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (36.0 - 100) = 104.464 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 104.464 mEq/L."

7795,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4284928-1,Extracted,"A 43-year-old Nigerian Yoruba woman para 1 (not alive) presented at the Urogynaecology Clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, on August 7, 2012, with 20-year history of leakage of urine per vaginam, which started 2 weeks after spontaneous vaginal delivery at term at a public secondary health facility. There was no history of augmentation, instrumentation, or difficult delivery. The labour however lasted 24 hours. She delivered a stillborn baby but could not remember the residual birth weight. She has urge to void despite the urinary leakage, and there was no stress incontinence. There were no urinary symptoms suggestive of infection. Initially, the patient was conservatively treated with urethral catheterization for continuous bladder drainage of urine for 6 weeks on outpatient basis with no resolution of symptoms after its removal. She had prophylactic antibiotic for 2 weeks during catheterization period. She had a failed vaginal surgical repair 19 years ago at a fistula center and had been living with the leakage of urine till presentation in our facility. She does not have any other medical condition. She menstruates regularly prior to surgery.
The patient separated from her husband shortly after the onset of urinary leakage, and she has been living alone with no family support. To avoid embarrassment of stigma, she relocated thrice within Nigeria and to neighboring Republic of Benin.
The patient is a middle-aged woman who is 1.7 m tall and weighs 82.0 kilograms. Physical and other systems examinations were normal except pelvic region. Bimanual digital vaginal examination in dorsal position shows reduced vagina length of 5 cm with obliteration of the fornices. There was no palpable defect on the anterior and posterior vaginal walls. The uterus was of normal size and adnexae were free. Examination under anaesthesia and dye test showed leakage of clear urine that was not dye-stained in the vagina after instillation of 100 mLs of methylene-blue dye into the urinary bladder. A diagnosis of ureterovaginal fistula was made.
Preoperative investigations done are as follows: haematocrit was 36 percent; full blood count, electrolyte, urea, and creatinine were normal. Urinalysis showed high level of nitrite and proteinuria. Microscopy, culture, and sensitivity of urine sample yielded a significant growth of Escherichia coli sensitive to nitrofurantoin and cefuroxime. Intravenous urography revealed prompt excretion of the contrast bilaterally. Both kidneys have duplication of collecting system with duplex ureters draining into the bladder. Opacification of urinary bladder shows a fairly smooth with a double density shadow and significant contrast below it suggesting vesicovaginal fistula (). Cystoscopy showed normal urethral caliber, and there was a bladder diverticulum with an opening inferior to the trigone, multiple ureteric orifices—two were located within the trigone while the other two were distal (1 to 2 cm) to the bladder neck. There was also a visible 8 bladder diverticulum measuring 2 cm by 3 cm inferior to the trigone (the lower edge was about 1 cm to the bladder neck) (). The conclusion at cystoscopy was bladder diverticulum and ectopic ureteric openings.
The patient had laparotomy done with combined spinal epidural regional anaesthesia. The intraoperative findings include moderate pelvic adhesions and bulky uterus with visualized normal ovaries and tubes. There were bilateral double ureters that drain separately into the bladder. Both kidneys were normal in size and location. Four ureteric orifices were visualized at the same location as described during cystoscopy. There was a bladder diverticulum measuring 2 cm by 3 cm located at about 1 cm short of bladder neck. The definitive surgery performed was ureteric reimplantation (ureteroneocystostomy) of the two distal ureteric openings to 2 cm superiolateral points of the two normally sited ureteric orifices, and diverticuloplasty. Ureteric stents were used to cannulate the neoureteric openings and a suprapubic cystostomy and urethral were catheterized each with size of 16 G Foley catheter. The woman had perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics and opioid analgesics and hydrated with 4 liters of intravenous fluids in the first 24 hours with satisfactory urinary output. Thereafter, she was commenced on oral fluids and diets with progressive improvement of her clinical status. The ureteric, suprapubic, and urethral catheters were removed on days 10, 14, and 21, respectively, and the patient had uneventful postoperative experience. She was discharged home after satisfactory bladder training on the 22nd postoperative day. She had urgency, which was managed with anticholinergic drug with resolution of symptoms. She resumed her menstrual period without hindrance.
Three months after the surgery, she had urodynamic studies performed at the PIUTA Ibadan Center at the Surgical Outpatient Department of the hospital with Solar Blue MMS Machine, Netherlands. The study showed a reduced bladder capacity of approximately 220 mLs with no signs of instability or leakage during filling phase but leaked on coughing at maximal bladder capacity (). She voided normally and to completion at the end of the study. She had no fresh complaint at subsequent clinics and was discharged from the follow-up clinic. During the discharge discussion, she expressed desire to have children in the future, and she was counseled on hospital supervised delivery with a specialist.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She had a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and denied history of biliary colic. On examination, she was febrile, agitated, and confused. Vital signs upon arrival were heart rate of 110/min, blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26/min, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature of 101.3 °F. She reported significant bloating and diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL (reference range, 12.2-18.1 g/dL), leukocyte count of 5.3 K/uL (reference range, 4.0-11.0 K/uL), glucose of 400 mg/dL (reference range, 60-100 mg/dL), and serum creatinine of 3.7 mg/dL (reference range, 0.6-1.4 mg/dL). Arterial blood gas analysis was consistent with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.15, HCO3 18 mEq/L, PaO2 89 mmHg). Urinalysis showed positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Urine microscopy revealed leukocyturia, hematuria, and moderate bacteriuria. The patient denied a history of diabetes mellitus.
Abdominal x-ray revealed gas over the right renal topography (). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed destruction of the right renal parenchyma, gas extending from the retroperitoneum to the retropubic space, and gas within the gallbladder wall (Figure ). Gas was also seen in the mediastinum. The diagnosis of EPN, EC, and pneumomediastinum was confirmed.
Empirical intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Imipenem and cilastatin with a renal dosage adjustment (250 mg IV every 12 hours) were initiated, along with fluid resuscitation with a crystalloid solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% every 8 hours. Percutaneous drainage of the kidney and gallbladder was performed 24 hours after arrival. A total of 140 mL of purulent material from the perinephric puncture was drained, as well as cloudy bile fluid from the percutaneous gallbladder puncture. Forty-eight hours later, the patient showed no clinical improvement, with persistent altered state of consciousness, high fever despite the medical management, and an increase in leukocyte count to 18.2 K/uL.
The patient was taken to the operating room for cholecystectomy and nephrectomy. A midline incision was made. The patient's gallbladder was enlarged, had a necrotic appearance, was extremely friable, and was attached to the liver. The kidney was completely destroyed and had a dark brown and necrotic appearance. At the time of renal dissection, friable perinephric tissue was found, as well as a fibrotic renal hilum, which made removal and hemostasis technically difficult. Total blood loss was 3.5 L, and the patient required 3 units of blood and 2 platelet units. A closed drain was placed in the perinephric space. Microscopy reported extensive proliferation of gram-negative bacilli in the renal parenchyma with extensive perinephric involvement and acute and chronic inflammatory changes. The gallbladder had embolic microabscesses and chronic inflammatory changes. Microbiologic analysis reported the same strain of Escherichia coli from urine, right kidney, perinephric exudate, blood, and gallbladder, suggesting hematogenous spread of the infection.
The patient required a 15-day hospital stay, with 10 days in the intensive care unit. She was discharged when her leukocyte count normalized. The drain was removed before discharge. Acute kidney injury was managed with a proper fluid replacement, and glycemic levels were within normal ranges achieved by IV insulin infusion administration.

There was no history of fever, vomiting, urinary or systemic symptoms, weight loss, or abdominal trauma.
The patient had no significant medical history, in particular, head injuries such as trauma, hemorrhage, or infection, and did not take any medications. Family history was unremarkable, with no antecedents of neoplasm or precocious puberty. Her mother was not taking any contraceptive hormonal medications, and there was no history of any other source of exposure to hormonal drugs.
On physical examination, the child appeared well. Her anthropometric parameters were as follows: weight 21 kg (50th percentile); height 117 cm (50–75th percentile). Her vital signs were normal, except for blood pressure at 130/90 mm Hg (>99th percentile for sex and height). She had neither dysmorphic features nor skin lesions (café-au-lait spots, facial acne). On abdominal examination, we palpated a mass, measuring 6 cm with regularly margins in the right upper quadrant. There was no central nervous system dysfunction (headache, vomiting or visual abnormalities). She had bilateral, symmetrical nontender enlargement of breast buds corresponding to stage 2 of the Tanner classification. There was no pubic or axillary hair, and her thyroid was normal on clinical inspection.
Laboratory work-up in the ED included a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and urinalysis. Her hematologic and basic metabolic panel, serum electrolytes, and liver and renal function tests were normal. Urinalysis confirmed hematuria. The child underwent an ultrasonography, which revealed a well-circumscribed heterogeneous echogenic mass, measuring 9.2 × 9.5 cm, in the right renal fossa. With suspicion of Wilms tumor, the child was admitted into the Oncology Department. On abdominal and pulmonary computerized tomography (CT), a high suspicion of nephroblastoma was made. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intermediary-risk nephroblastoma stage I.
The first endocrine work-up revealed a normal thyroid function and prepubertal gonadotropin levels (see ). Ultrasonography excluded ovarian and adrenal masses and showed infantile ovaries and uterus. Bone age was not performed. The endocrine diagnosis was bilateral PT.
The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) 2001 chemotherapy protocol (dactinomycin/vincristine) was commenced, with complete excision of the tumor performed 4 weeks later. Additional chemotherapy cycles were provided after surgery, for a total duration of 3 months. The clinical tolerance and response were excellent, without any side effects or signs of residual tumor.
A second endocrine assessment was performed at the end of chemotherapy. Surprisingly, we identified an accelerated linear growth (a gain of 3 cm in 4 months) in the context of rapid breast development (passage from stage 2 to stage 3 over 4 months) with no axillary or pubic hair. The second hormonal work-up found an activated pituitary-gonadal axis () along with advanced skeletal maturation and ultrasound signs of uterine hormonal impregnation. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) stimulation test was carried out and showed a pubertal response, confirming gonadotropin-dependent puberty ().
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a morphologically normal pituitary, but of pubertal size (pituitary height of 6 mm and marked convexity of the upper surface) and no congenital or acquired lesions in the pineal or hypothalamic-optic region (). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels (repeated twice at different time points) were normal. hCG-secreting tumor was considered as potential etiology of PP, but this diagnosis was excluded on both biological (high LH and FSH levels, normal hCG) and radiological arguments (no tumor in liver, mediastinum, ovaries, or CNS).
The definitive diagnosis of idiopathic CPP was made, and we began treatment with GnRHa (11.25 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly). Six months later, we noted a reassuring clinical evolution, with partial regression of breast development, reduction in growth velocity (2 cm/6 months), and increasingly random LH level at 3.4 IU/L. Recently, a prospective study [] showed that this biological evolution, with incomplete suppression of LH levels, is common in children with CPP under treatment. In a patient with a favorable clinical response (neither clinical pubertal progression, nor an advancement of bone age), this biological evolution should not be interpreted as indicative of treatment failure.
The global evolution of our patient, from oncological diagnosis up to 6 months after the beginning of CPP treatment, is depicted in .","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [21.0, 'kg']}",61.0,57.95,64.05,"The patient's weight is 21.0 kg.

Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (21.0 kg - 20 kg) = 61.0 mL/hr.

8611,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-5644139-1,Extracted,"A 57-year-old Japanese man presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe epigastric pain. His medical history included untreated hypertension and hyperuricemia for 3 years; Family history was unremarkable. He was a nonsmoker and did not consume alcohol. He was admitted to the hospital for further treatment.
On admission, his height was 165 cm and weight, which had been unchanged over the past 10 years, was 49 kg. His body temperature was 36.5 °C, and blood pressure was 168/94 mmHg. His heart rate was 90 beats/min and regular. With the exception of tenderness on palpation over the epigastrium, his physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC, 16,200/mm3 [normal range, 3300–8600/mm3]) as well as elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (246 U/L [normal range, 124–222 U/L]), uric acid (529 μmol/L [normal range, 230–420 μmol/L), and C-reactive protein (CRP, 39.8 mg/L [normal, <1.5 mg/L]). Hemoglobin concentration was normal (141 g/L; normal, 137–168 g/L). Serum concentrations of lactic acid, electrolytes, and bicarbonate were normal, as was his anion gap. An abdominal X-ray was unremarkable.
Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT demonstrated an intimal flap inside the SMA at the proximal portion of the aneurysm (Fig. ), suggesting that aneurysm formation might have ensued from spontaneous SMA dissection. Luminal stenosis of the SMA, with concentric intramural hematoma without extravasation, and aneurysm formation at the distal portion of the SMA were also observed (Fig. ). Notably, CT angiography demonstrated two lesions showing segmental dilatation proximal to the SMA aneurysm (Fig. ). Because of the risk of SMA aneurysm rupture, antihypertensive therapy was started; specifically, continuous intravenous infusion of nicardipine (2 μg/kg/min) was begun soon after obtaining the CT, and the patient’s blood pressure decreased to about 110/60 mmHg. Although there was narrowing of the SMA, especially in the proximal portion of the aneurysm, anticoagulation therapy was not instituted.
On hospital day 2, the patient’s epigastric pain persisted. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was again performed, but no obvious changes were seen compared with the CT findings on admission. Thereafter, his epigastric pain gradually resolved. By hospital day 4, the patient’s WBC count had normalized to 5400/mm3 and serum CRP had decreased to 15.4 mg/L. The patient’s epigastric pain had completely resolved by hospital day 5 but recurred on day 6. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT on the same day revealed a notable increase in the size of the SMA aneurysm to 31 × 29 mm, from 23 × 24 mm on admission, and a decrease in the aneurysm’s wall thickness in some areas (Fig. ). CT angiography strongly suggested occlusion of the distal SMA because SMA blood flow distal to the aneurysm, which had been detected on CT angiograph on admission, disappeared (Fig. ). WBC count and serum CRP level were also elevated to 8700/mm3 and 37.6 mg/L, respectively. Because of the risk of aneurysm rupture and ischemic bowel necrosis, the decision was made to perform surgical resection of the SMA aneurysm and partial distal ileum; the length of the resected ileum was 43 cm. This was performed on day 6. During the bowel resection procedure, the SMA was divided at a point showing segmental vasodilation, just proximal to the lesion (Fig. ). Gross inspection revealed no obvious bowel necrosis, but there was evidence of the formation of a pseudoaneurysm inside the mesentery (Fig. ). The SMA distal to the pseudoaneurysm was occluded by thrombus.
Histopathologic examination of specimens of the resected SMA focused on the four regions shown in Fig. . On microscopic examination, there was latent dissection inside the lesion, with vasodilatation adjacent to the proximal resection stump, and the pseudolumen of the dissection was filled with fibrin (Fig. ). In addition, the internal and external elastic membranes of the SMA had partially disappeared, and the lesion was seen to have medial vacuolization and lysis without infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. ). In an area slightly distal to this lesion, the internal elastic membrane was preserved (Fig. ), but partial vacuolization and lysis in the arterial media and eccentric intimal proliferation remained (Fig. ). At the neck of the SMA aneurysm, dissection of the arterial media was evident, and both medial vacuolization and partial disappearance of internal elastic membrane were again observed. Notably, remarkable stenosis of the true lumen due to intimal proliferation was evident (Fig. ). The arterial wall at the distal aspect of the SMA aneurysm showed a normal structure of internal elastic membrane and notably less vacuolization in the arterial media (Fig. ).
Postoperatively, the patient was in good condition. Intravenous administration of nicardipine was discontinued on hospital day 12 (postoperative day 6), and oral amlodipine (5 mg/day), valsartan (80 mg/day) and allopurinol (100 mg/day) were started on hospital day 13 (postoperative day 7). He was discharged from our hospital on hospital day 14 (postoperative day 8). The patient has now been followed for 6 months and has had no recurrence of SMA dissection or associated aneurysm formation.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [49.0, 'kg'], 'height': [165.0, 'cm']}",56.446,53.624,59.268,"The patient's gender is Male.

3603,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8314493-1,Extracted,"A 70-year-old Japanese man without any major family and psychosocial history was referred to our hospital to continue treatment for DME. At the patient’s former hospital, his major symptom was repeated visual disturbance of both eyes due to DME, and he received sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injection and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. Sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injections were once in both eyes, and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were 12 times in both eyes every 2–3 months (4 times with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 7 times with 2 mg aflibercept in the right eye and once with aflibercept in the left eye) during the 2.5-year follow-up period. At the patient’s former hospital, the last anti-VEGF therapies were injected in the left eye in July 2016 and the right eye in December 2016.
At the patient’s first visit to our hospital in January 2017, his body height and weight was 160 cm and 52 kg [body mass index (BMI) 20.3], respectively. His HbA1c level was 6.3 %, and he has been suffering from diabetes mellitus for 10 years with only diet therapy. His blood pressure was 120/61 mmHg, and he had no hypertension. Although he had hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 244 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 148 mg/dl), he did not receive any pharmacological treatments for it. He has been treated with donepezil hydrochloride for mild cognitive impairment in the neurology department of Tokyo Takanawa Hospital. However, because he works regularly and can attend a hospital by himself, he has no hindrance to daily life. In addition, there was no issue on financial and language/cultural challenges. A dilated fundus examination showed mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy [], with several small hemorrhages without macular edema, and his best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in both eyes. The central subfield macular thickness (CMT) on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was 279/320 μm (right eye/left eye).
Five months later, he noticed blurred vision in both eyes (visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes), and a fundus examination showed significant macular edema in both eyes (CMT, 404/478 μm). In June 2017, for the first time at our hospital, the patient received 2-mg intravitreal aflibercept injections in both eyes 1 week apart (6 June in the right eye and 13 June in the left eye). No laser therapy was applied. After short-term anti-VEGF therapies to both eyes, his systemic condition remained the same. The treatment was effective in both eyes, and 1 month later, his CMT recovered to 277/321 μm, and his blurred vision disappeared (visual acuity was 1.0 in right eye and 1.2 in left eye). Three months after the first treatment at our hospital (1 September 2017), significant macular edema relapsed in both eyes (CMT, 403/463 μm; Fig. ), visual acuity was 0.8 in right eye and 1.0 in left eye, and he desired continuous treatment for both eyes. In October 2017, he received intravitreal aflibercept injections in both eyes 1 week apart (3 October in the right eye and 10 October in the left eye). One month after treatment (10 November), his subjective complaint of blurred vision disappeared (0.8 in right eye and 1.2 in left eye), and the CMT decreased to 280/315 μm (Fig. ). During this period, his HbA1c levels were measured and kept at 6.5% (3 October, 10 October, and 10 November).
Upon initiating the intravitreal injection in the operating room, we measured his blood pressure as 141/69 mmHg (3 October) and 135/70 mmHg (10 October) without blood-pressure-lowering drugs (Fig. a). However, on 12 November, just 2 days after a follow-up visit to our hospital, he complained of a severe headache and walked to the emergency department at Tokyo Takanawa Hospital. He complained of a severe headache on the right back side of his head and visual disturbance of the left visual field with no other systemic neuropathological symptoms. He had no external injury presumed as trauma antecedent and no other apparent causes leading to cerebral hemorrhage. His blood pressure was elevated at 195/108 mmHg, and computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed the presence of a high-density area (2.5 × 3.0 cm) in the right occipital lobe indicating a subcortical hemorrhage (Fig. a). The patient was treated with an intravenous injection of nicardipine hydrochloride to lower his systemic blood pressure to < 140 mmHg for 2 days. On 13 November, CT showed no enlargement of the high-density area (data not shown). On 15 November, 3 days after the stroke, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a peripheral low-intensity zone in the same region (T2*-weighted MRI, Fig. b) and a low-intensity area (diffusion-weighted MRI, Fig. a) in the occipital lobe that was consistent with the CT results. Additionally, magnetic resonance (MR) angiography revealed no vascular anomalies or malformation (Fig. b), and T2*-weighted MRI revealed no cerebral microbleeds, thus ruling out cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Fig. b). He was therefore diagnosed with a hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage of the occipital lobe. On 14 November, 2 days after the stroke, the patient began oral treatment with 80 mg/day telmisartan, which was continued for 3 days. Starting 17 November, the telmisartan dose was reduced to 40 mg/day. During this period, his blood pressure was maintained at < 130/80 mmHg, and his symptoms of severe headache disappeared, and visual disturbance of the left visual field was alleviated. Ten days later, he was discharged from Tokyo Takanawa Hospital, and 20 days after discharge he visited our hospital to receive a follow-up ophthalmological examination. Two months after the stroke (5 January 2018), visual field tests with Goldmann perimetry at our hospital showed no apparent left homonymous hemianopsia (Fig. ). Follow-up CT (14 February 2018; Fig. c) and T2*-weighted MRI (24 July 2018; Fig. d) examinations revealed that the cerebral hemorrhage had been absorbed, and the lesion had decreased in size. One year after the cerebrovascular stroke, the telmisartan was discontinued because his blood pressure had stabilized to a normal level and remained around 110/60 mmHg.
The patient received no anti-VEGF therapy for 4 months prior to 3 October 2017 because his macular edema did not relapse. We happened to determine his plasma VEGF levels before and after the intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (October 2017) via specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SRL, Tokyo, Japan; Fig. b). The patient’s plasma VEGF level was 28 pg/ml on 3 October, just before the intravitreal injection of aflibercept in the right eye. However, the level rapidly decreased to below the detection limit (< 20 pg/ml) on 10 October, just before the injection in his left eye. Notably, the levels on 10 November (2 days before the cerebral hemorrhage) and 10 December were also below the detection limit. On 25 January 2018, we confirmed that his plasma VEGF level had recovered to 41 pg/ml. Thereafter, we continued to follow the patient for DME and diabetic retinopathy, and no cerebral hemorrhage recurred.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [160.0, 'cm']}",56.882,54.038,59.726,"The patient's gender is Male.

There was no family history of parathyroid disease, hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, or other endocrinopathies. At admission the physical examination revealed tachycardia, and serum calcium was 12.2 mg/dL. Thyroid ultrasound revealed an heterogeneous mass along the inferior margin of the left thyroid gland, measuring 8 mm. Laboratory investigations included total calcium level 11.95 mg/dL (normal range, 8.10 - 9.80), parathyroid hormone (PTH) 142 pg/mL (normal range, 11 - 67), phosphorus 1.8 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5 - 4.3), serum albumin 4.02 g/dL (normal range, 3.40 - 4.65), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.083 mIU/L (normal range, 0.270 - 4.200) and fT4 22.80 (normal range, 9.30 - 17.00). Biochemical hyperthyroidism was interpreted as consistent with pregnancy-induced rise of beta human chorionic gonadotropin. A fine needle aspiration from the mass demonstrated scant cells, and it was reported as benign cytology. She was diagnosed with PHP. Conservative treatment with intravenous fluid (lactated ringers 500 mL/day and normal saline 1,000 mL/day) and furosemide 20 mg/die was started, monitoring blood pressure, daily diuresis and body weight. Meanwhile obstetric evaluation showed appropriate for gestational age fetal biometry. Neck computed tomography 4D showed a solitary adenoma of the parathyroid gland, measuring 6 × 2.9 × 11 mm ().
On May 15 (14 weeks of gestation), the patient underwent cervical exploration with left superior parathyroidectomy. The histopathology showed a benign adenoma (). The basal level of PTH was 151 pg/mL, within 10 min after the parathyroid adenoma was removed the PTH level decreased to 12 pg/mL. Intravenous glucose solution 5% (500 mL) with calcium gluconate 10% was started in the first 36 h after surgery and then was continued with oral calcium 1,000 mg two times a day. Total calcium level at the end of the intravenous calcium infusion was 8.88 mg/dL. Vitamin D supplementation (25,000 IU/week) for 6 weeks (and then one time a month) was also started and continued for 6 weeks. The postoperative period was uneventful; in particular she did not develop hypocalcemia after surgery. Her serum calcium and PTH levels normalized; on May 22, PTH was 31 pg/mL and total calcium level 8.99 mg/dL. She was discharged on May 30.
In subsequent weekly follow-up, her serum calcium and PTH levels have been within the normal limits. On October 30, at 38 weeks of gestation, the patient gave birth to a healthy female baby of adequate weight. Ethical approval was not required based on national laws regarding anonymized data.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

Family history consisted of a mother-related uncle on dialysis with biopsy-proven Alport disease, another mother-related cousin with kidney involvement, and a grandfather who died due to sudden death at the age of 42. The patient was asymptomatic and normotensive (blood pressure 115/68 mmHg), with a body mass index of 24 and no tobacco consumption. Main laboratory results included hematocrit 44%, glycemia 78 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.07 mg/dL, creatinine clearance of 74 mL/min, sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, serum albumin 4.3 g/dL, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion 250 mg/day.

Podocyturia was assessed as follows: fresh urine samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm during 5 min and the supernatant was discarded; 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2–7.4 was added to the sediment to cover it. Smears were made from each sample on 2% silane-coated slides. The slides were stained with immunofluorescence technique and observed by epifluorescent microscopy. The slides were preincubated with no immune rabbit serum in phosphate-buffered saline 0.1 M, pH 7.4 (PBS, 1 : 100) at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with a polyclonal anti-synaptopodin antibody (1 : 100, ab109560 Alexa Fluor®, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) overnight in a wet chamber at 4°C. After several rinses in PBS, the slides were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1 : 200 Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for 2 hours at room temperature in a wet chamber. Finally, all the slides were mounted using Fluoroshield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and observed in an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

PEG had been performed 9 months prior to this admission. The patient's condition had been stable for 8 months after PEG. Vital signs and laboratory results upon admission were as follows: blood pressure, 80/40 mmHg; body temperature, 36.8℃; white blood cell count, 18,300/µL; hemoglobin level, 13.2 g/dL; BUN level, 10.3 mg/dL; creatinine level, 0.9 mg/dL; urine white blood cell count, high. His septic condition improved after adequate hydration and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the postprandial watery diarrhea persisted. On the 12th day of hospitalization, an upper endoscopy revealed a gastrocolic fistula and the internal bumper of the PEG tube was not seen (). The feeding tube was withdrawn after the upper endoscopy. On the same day, a colonoscopy also revealed a gastrocolic fistula in the transverse colon (). Several metal clips were applied to seal the gastrocolic fistula opening (). Abdominal CT performed before upper endoscopy showed that the bumper of the feeding tube had migrated into the colonic lumen () and revealed a fistula tract between the stomach and colon (). In a radiologic study using gastrografin administered through the nasogastric tube 1 week later, there was no leakage of dye (). The patient was discharged with a nasogastric tube for feeding after the external opening of the gastrocolocutaneous fistula was closed.

Tab isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg od was discontinued after 9 days.
Ventilatory support was withdrawn after 4 days (March 16, 2010) and she was put on nasal oxygen. On discontinuation of the nasal support on 17th March she desaturated within 10 - 15 minutes and was tachypnoeic, dyspnoeic and cyanosed. Her PaO2 dropped to 30% - 35%. This improved rapidly on reinstituting nasal O2. A repeat 2 D Echo (March 19, 2010) revealed mild LV dysfunction and pulmonary artery pressure of 62 mmHg.

He received triple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolone. His subsequent course was uneventful until 2 years post-transplantation (February 2002) when a rise in serum creatinine to 2.1 mg/dL (190 umol/L) prompted a kidney biopsy. The biopsy showed severe polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN) stage B [], and BK virus (BKV) DNA was identified in urine and serum by PCR. Cyclosporin A and azathioprine were substituted for tacrolimus and MMF. Over the following 6 years, creatinine was stable at 2.1–2.3 mg/dL (190–200 umol/L); BKV DNA remained detectable in the serum at fluctuating low levels of 422–570 copies/mL (2.63–2.76 log10 copies/mL) on the seven occasions when it was measured over these 6 years. Regular urine cytology was performed in the first 2 years following the diagnosis of PVN with no malignant cells seen. In May 2007, urine examination showed a small number of red cells (20 × 106 RBC/L) and in December 2007 urine examination showed 600 × 106 RBC/L. Subsequent urine cytology revealed malignant cells; no definite ‘decoy cells’ were seen. The patient was referred to a urologist, and during cystoscopy urinary bladder biopsies were performed. These showed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with invasion of the muscularis propria and a focal invasive micropapillary pattern. On immunohistochemistry, the tumour showed diffuse strong nuclear staining for Simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen (T-Ag) and P53 in >90% of cells (Figure ). No normal mucosa was present.

Within the cystectomy specimen, residual high-grade urothelial carcinoma with invasion into perivesical fat and prominent lymphovascular space invasion was seen (Figure ). The tumour showed a predominant invasive micropapillary pattern. Elsewhere, the urothelium showed focal evidence of in situ carcinoma (Figure ). No polyomavirus nuclear changes were evident in the non-malignant urothelium, and there was no convincing cystitis. Diffuse strong expression of SV40 T-Ag was seen in both the invasive and in situ carcinoma (Figure ), whereas the non-malignant urothelium and atrophic native kidney were negative.

Her medical history was positive for ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Five years ago, she underwent cardiac catheterization followed by a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with an implantation of five stents. Her ongoing medication included subcutaneous insulin, antianginals (diltiazem, nitroglycerine, ranolazine, TriCardin®), clopidogrel, and an antacid.
On presentation, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure 162/82 mmHg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Due to the worsening of her angina symptoms, she was admitted for elective coronary angiography to assess the status of previously placed stents. On admission, her labs revealed poor diabetic control (hemoglobin A1C 9.3%) and dyslipidemia (total cholesterol 214 mg/dl, triglycerides 203 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein 165 mg/dl, very low density lipoprotein 41 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein 45 mg/dl). Cardiac enzymes were not raised (creatine kinase-myocardial band 19.4 U/l and troponin-I 0.44 ng/ml). Blood counts, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, viral markers, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. Her previous transthoracic echocardiography was significant for hypokinesis of the inferoseptal segment of the left ventricle and an ejection fraction of 50%.
An elective coronary angiography revealed critical ISR in the distal right coronary artery (RCA) stent (Figure ). Furthermore, critical stenosis (80%) at the mid-distal junction of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and 40%-50% stenosis of the proximal ostium were also seen (Figure ). Patent stents were present in the proximal RCA and mid-LAD artery segments. The patient refused to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. Therefore, a two-staged elective PCI involving the RCA and LAD artery was planned to treat the ISR. Stage I PCI to RCA was performed after pre-dilating the vessel. RCA ostium was intubated with guiding catheter JL3.5-6Fr. The lesion was crossed using the Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II Guidewire (Abbott Cardiovascular, Santa Clara, CA). The area was then dilated with a Mini-Trek balloon (2 x 20 mm; Abbott Cardiovascular). Finally, a Xience Xpedition® everolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium coronary stent (2.5 x 48 mm; Abbott Cardiovascular) was deployed at 17 atmospheres (ATMs) while overlapping the previous stent. The entire length of the stent was post-dilated with an NC-Trek balloon (2.75 x 15 mm; Abbott Cardiovascular). An excellent final angiographic result with well-deployed stents and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) III distal blood flow was achieved.
Stage II PCI to the LAD artery was performed two days later. Left mainstem ostium was intubated with guiding catheter JL3.5-6Fr. The stenosed area was crossed using a Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II Guidewire. The mid-LAD artery lesion was directly stented with a Xience PrimeTM everolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium coronary stent (2.5 x 18 mm; Abbott Cardiovascular) and deployed at 13 ATMs overlapping the previously placed mid-LAD artery stent. Next, the overlapped segment and the previously placed stent were post-dilated with the same stent balloon at 15 ATMs. Ostial proximal LAD artery lesion was directly stented with another Xience PrimeTM coronary stent (2.5 x 18 mm) and deployed at 13 ATMs overlapping the first stents. Then the entire length of the stents was post-dilated with an NC-TREK balloon (2.5 x 15 mm) at 17 ATMs. An excellent final angiographic result with well-deployed stents and TIMI III distal blood flow was achieved in this case as well (Figure ).

He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3°C.
Physical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.
Due to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.
Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67 mg/dl, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 165. Troponin I was <0.012 ng/mL. Initial lactic acid was recorded at 13.9 mmol/L. An arterial blood gas revealed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 22.3 mmHg, pO2 of 105.5 mmHg, HCO3 of 5.3 meq/L, and a Base Excess of -24.8 mmol/l. The patient was anuric at this time. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471. The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).
While in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed. In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department. Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED. After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward. Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.
After successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition. He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone. Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient’s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient’s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors. A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped. Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days.

3474,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-4166791-1,Extracted,"A 90-year-old woman presented at our institution suffering from right hip joint pain that had been absent since an earlier visit when she was 83 years old. Her height was 153 cm and her body weight was 58 kg. She had a history of hypertension. The clinical course of her joint pain was as follows: she initially complained of continued right hip joint pain at the age of 83 years and 3 months. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration and bisphosphonate (BP) treatment for osteoporosis were given. A mild thoracic vertebral compression fracture was also observed approximately 7 years earlier at the patient’s first visit. Osteoporotic treatment with BP had been continued since that time. Right hip bone mineral density (BMD) 7 years prior and at present were 0.915 (T score = -1.7) and 1.094 (T score = -0.1), respectively. Left hip BMD had risen from 0.702 (T score = -1.9) 7 years earlier to 0.755 (T score = -1.5) at present. During follow-up, she sometimes complained of mild hip joint pain. At the time of this report, her joint pain was substantially decreased.
Right hip range of motion (ROM) was slightly restricted at the patient’s first visit, but did not worsen over 7 years.
A right hip plain radiograph at age 83 showed joint space narrowing (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL] grading II) [] (Fig. ) that was diagnosed as radiographic OA. There was no acetabular dysplasia. At the age of 83 years and 8 months, plain radiographs revealed greater joint space narrowing, a band around the bone defect change-like osteonecrosis, and a concave shape to the right femoral head (Fig. ). The necrotic region of the femoral head had progressed a year after onset and was noticeably worsened at the age of 86 (Fig. , ). Ensuing radiographs showed progressive destruction of the femoral head and osteosclerotic change of the remaining joint line (Fig. ). In addition, radiographs retrospectively uncovered a laddering-shaped deformity in the right lateral proximal femoral head and a fracture-like line that were consistent with the necrotic region (Fig. , arrow).
The particularity of this case was that 1) the patient was initially diagnosed as having radiographic OA, 2) joint pain was markedly improved after a few months, 3) the femoral head degenerated over several years in the absence of joint pain, and 4) radiographic diagnosis changed based on the timing of disease progression.

3704,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-3366317-1,Extracted,"A 48-year-old woman 155 cm tall weighing 30 kg, with cystic fibrosis had surgery planned for single lung transplantation. Twenty-years earlier, she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. She needed right lung transplantation because of progressive dyspnea and recurrent respiratory infection after left pneumonectomy, which was due to a huge aspergilloma in the upper lobe of the left lung 5 years before her visit to our hospital. There was nothing particular about her case except for her lung disease and her vital signs and laboratory workup were normal before surgery. In addition, arterial blood gas analysis (pH 7.35, PaCO2 51.8 mmHg, PaO2 74.6 mmHg, HCO3- 28 mEq/L, BE 1.3 mEq/L, SaO2 94.2%) showed mild respiratory acidosis. Results of the echocardiography before surgery showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%, an enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle, a mild tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and minimal pericardial effusion. The donor was a patient with traumatic SAH and SDH and was fit for donating a lung based of their medical history and laboratory workup.
The cystic fibrosis patient had an enlargement of the right thorax and a left mediastinal shift (organs such as trachea, heart, aorta, vena cava etc.) as a result of the past left pneumonectomy, and it caused an abnormal positioning, twisting, and narrowing of the subclavian vein and internal jugular vein; therefore, a 9 Fr. central vein catheter (advanced venous access, AVA high flow device, Edwards LifeSciences, USA) was inserted into the internal jugular vein under angiography in the angiography room because of difficulty in performing the catheter insertion and due to the risk of vascular perforation ().
The patient arrived at the operating room and was administered oxygen 5 L/min by nasal cannula. Additionally, noninvasive BP monitoring, electrocardiography, and pulse oxymetry was immediately done after arriving at the operating room, and a BIS monitor was attached and a monitor was connected to the right radial artery catheter and a femoral artery catheter. Before putting the patient under anesthesia, her measured vital signs were a BP of 115/78 mmHg, a HR of 85 beats/min, and a SaO2 of 95%. To induce anesthesia, 6 mg of etomidate and 5 mg of vecuronium were injected and an internal diameter 7.0mm tracheal tube was inserted after manual ventilation with 100% oxygen. The ventilator was set to a FiO2 of 0.5, a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, a RR of 10 breaths/min and a TV of 350 ml using the volume-controlled mode. After that, through the center vein catheter, which was inserted into the right internal jugular vein, a 7 Fr. pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo catheter, Edwards LifeSciences, USA) was inserted into the central pulmonary artery, and at that time, the pulmonary artery pressure was 61/26 mmHg. To maintain anesthesia, 3.5 µg/ml of propofol and 3.0 ng/ml of remifentanil with target-controlled infusion were consistently injected and the injection speed of these anesthetics was controlled according to the change in vital signs, and cell saver was used during the surgery.
After positioning the patient in the supine position with both arms elevated, the surgery started with a clamshell incision. First of all, before the pneumonectomy, by inserting a catheter into the aorta and the right atrium, cardiopulmonary bypass was done during surgery to not only prevent unstable vital signs due to severe pulmonary hypertension and profuse bleeding caused by severe adhesion of the right lung as a result of recurring infection but also to oxygenize the blood after the pneumonectomy. Before the cardiopulmonary bypass was started, 10,000 units of heparin were injected, and 3 minutes later, the activated coagulation time was 450-seconds. After starting the cardiopulmonary bypass, the ventilator was taken off and 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone were injected after the pneumonectomy. Thereafter, immediately, the bronchus, pulmonary artery, and vein of the transplanted lung were anastomosed to the patient. At some point, blood pressure dropped 80/45 mmHg because of bleeding or pressing of the intramediastinal structure, but it was relatively stable maintaining a blood pressure of more than 100/50 mmHg and SaO2 of 100%. The ischemic time of the right lung was 75-minutes.
Anastomosis of each organ was done well and reperfusion was attempted after pulmonary vein anastomosis. To reduce increased pulmonary artery pressure and prevent reperfusion injury, a weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass was attempted after setting the FiO2 to 0.4, the PEEP to 5 cmH2O, the RR to 14 breaths/min, the TV to 300 ml, and the nitric oxide (NO) to 20 ppm by the volume-controlled mode connected to a prepared NO ventilator. The results of the arterial blood gas analyses after connecting the NO ventilator were stable showing a pH of 7.48, a PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, a PaO2 of 449 mmHg, a HCO3- of 30.5 mEq/L, a BE of 6.4 mEq/L, and a SaO2 of 100%. The results of the arterial blood gas analyses after weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass was a pH of 7.42, a PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, a PaO2 of 89 mmHg, a HCO3- of 30.5 mEq/L, a BE of 5.2 mEq/L, and a SaO2 of 97%; therefore, a FiO2 of 1.0 was maintained. presents the results of the arterial blood gas analyses during the surgery.
The blood pressure decreased to 75/40 mmHg during the process of reducing the flow to gradually wean the patient off the cardiopulmonary bypass; thus, fluids were injected into her body, and 10 mcg/kg/min and 0.02 mcg/kg/min of dopamine and epinephrine, respectively, were consistently injected. After that, the surgery was completed with no complications and the patient was transferred to the SICU with manual ventilation. Total anesthesia time was 6 hours 45 minutes; the operation lasted 4 hours; cardiopulmonary bypass time was 2 hours 25 minutes. The volume of total bleeding was 3,000 ml; the amount of total fluid infused was 500 ml of crystralloid solution and 1,100 ml of colloid solution. Total transfusion was 10 units of irradiated WBC-depleted RBC, 7 units of FFP, 10 units of PC. Urine output was 1,600 ml.
2 days after the surgery, the patient received a tracheostomy to take her off the ventilator (). Six days after surgery, she was transported to the general ward and seemed to get better using a home ventilator. However, 42 days later, she died of inhalation pneumonia.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [155.0, 'cm']}",47.855,45.462,50.248,"The patient's gender is Female.

Six days prior to the consultation she underwent an elective hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids. Her past medical history included T2DM and peptic ulcer. She was a former smoker. Her medications included a combination of metformin/vildagliptin 850/50 mg b.i.d., empagliflozin 25 mg o.d. and omeprazole 20 mg o.d. The patient remained fasting for the 1st and 2nd postoperative day and, after feeding was re-instituted on the 3rd day, she reported episodes of vomiting during the 4th and the 5th postoperative day. On day 5, she also began to feel increasingly weak and fatigued, while on day 6 she became febrile, and was started on intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g t.i.d.)
On clinical examination, the patient appeared generally fatigued. Temperature was 37.7 °C, blood pressure was 160/80 mmHg, and heart rate 105 beats/min. The patient was tachypnoic with a respiratory rate of 35 breaths/min. Her abdominal examination revealed a fresh surgical incision, and diffuse tenderness with no focal guarding or rebound. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Her diuresis was excessive, with a urine flow rate up to 300 ml/hour. Due to postoperative fever, blood and urine cultures were withdrawn, and an abdominal ultrasound was performed revealing no pathological findings. In patient’s initial laboratory investigation the white cell count was 31.2 K/μL (N:81%, L:7%, M:11%) and serum glucose level was 121 mg/dl. Serum creatinine was 0.67 mg/dl and urea 27 mg/dl, while albumin and calcium values were within the normal range. Liver function tests, bilirubin, and lipase were normal (Table ). Arterial blood gas revealed severe metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.05, [HCO3−]: 3 mmol/L, PCO2: 12 mmHg, anion gap: 16.9 mEq/L, lactate: 0.6 mmol/L, [Na+]: 133 mmol/L, [K+]: 3.8 mmol/L and [Cl−]: 113 mmol/L.
The patient was transferred in the Department of Nephrology, where during a more detailed examination of her medical history, she reported that she had continued taking her antidiabetic medication by herself, although this information was not formally recorded in her medical file and charts. Furthermore, she remained fasting for 48 h postoperatively. As severe acidosis with only mildly increased glucose levels was revealed, euDKA due to SGLT-2 inhibitor was highly suspected and blood and urine samples were drawn for ketone examination. The urinalysis was remarkable with more than 160 mg/dl of ketones, as well as more than 1000 mg/dl of glucose. The profound glycosuria with only mildly elevated blood glucose was highly suggestive of treatment with an SGLT-2 inhibitor, which act by inhibiting glucose reabsorption and are the only antidiabetic agents increasing urine glucose concentration.
With the diagnosis of euDKA confirmed, as HCO3 levels were extremely low and the anion gap only mildly elevated, 100 mmol of NaHCO3 were initially infused over 2 h. In parallel, intravenous fluids and insulin administration were started based on DKA protocol. Serum HCO3 levels were only minimally increased at 3 h, but with the DKA causes being removed and on the basis of normal renal function they were further improved over time. Blood gases at 12 and 24 h post the initiation of treatment are presented in Table , suggesting that the pH was normalized in 24 h. As profound hypophosphatemia with serum phosphate of 0.7 mg/dl was noted 24 h after admission, phosphate infusion was also administered (20 mmol of sodium glycerophosphate over 16 h). The patient regained her appetite and was switched to a basal and pre-prandial insulin regimen. At that time, clinical signs of postsurgical cellulitis became apparent. At 48 h, the patient was transferred back to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for continuation of treatment for post-surgical infection with proper antibiotics. The laboratory results at 48 h are presented in Table .

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 113.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 113.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 113.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 113.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 113.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 113.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 3.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 3.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 3.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 3.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 3.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 3.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (113.0 mEq/L + 3.0 mEq/L) = 17.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 17.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 17.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 17.0 - 12 = 5.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 5.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 5.0 mEq/L / 21.0 mEq/L = 0.238. The patient's delta ratio is 0.238."

In a chest radiograph done under the suspicion of an upper respiratory infection, a round foreign object with a diameter of 21 mm was detected in the upper esophagus (). In a sleep endoscopy, it was confirmed to be a circular battery (), and ingestion was estimated to occur three days prior to the hospital visit, and it was determined that endoscopic removal would not be easy. Therefore, it was decided to immediately remove the battery under general anesthesia.
The infant had no underlying disease, and glycopyrrolate 0.05 mg was IM injected 30 minutes before arriving at the operating room as premedication for the anesthesia. The infant was monitored by ECG, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and a pulse oximetry, and before anesthesia, her blood pressure was 85/61 mmHg; her heart rate was 160 beats/min with 100% oxygen saturation. 10 mg of Ketamine was IV injected and after loss of consciousness, 5 mg of Rocunium was IV injected. When the muscles were sufficiently relaxed, an uncuffed endotracheal tube with a 4 mm inside diameter was intubated. After intubation, both lungs were checked through a stethoscope and found to be normal, and the endotracheal tube was set to 11 cm in accordance with the top front teeth. Anesthesia was maintained by 2 L/min of air, 2 L/min of O2, and 2.0-3.5 vol% of sevoflurane. The tidal volume was 90 ml; respiratory rate was 18/min through volume-controlled mechanical ventilation to maintain an end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) pressure of 35-40 mmHg and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at this point was 19 cmH2O.
An adult endoscope with a 9 mm outer diameter was used for the removal procedure because the hospital did not have a pediatric endoscope with forceps. 2 minutes after inserting the endoscope, severe abdominal inflation was observed, and PIP increased up to 28-30 cmH2O with the tidal volume decreasing to less than 50 ml. The battery had caused an inflammatory change and conglutinated onto surrounding tissue in the esophagus, and 3 minutes after inserting the endoscope, oxygen saturation decreased to 80%, and EtCO2 pressure rose to 70 mmHg therefore the surgery was stopped and the endoscope was removed. By manual ventilation using 100% oxygen, oxygen saturation was recovered to 100% and EtCO2 pressure to 40 mmHg, and thereafter, the endoscope was reinserted.
In the second attempt of the procedure, manual ventilation was done instead of mechanical ventilation. However, 1 minute after the insertion of the endoscope, a sudden strong resistance was felt in the reservoir bag, and the tidal volume was less than 20 ml despite applying more than 35 cmH2O for the PIP. Oxygen saturation dropped below 60% so the procedure could not be continued; therefore, the endoscope was removed again. Here, a PIP of 25-30 cmH2O and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained. The endoscope was reinserted after recovering oxygen saturation to 100%, but due to the increased airway pressure, ventilation was not possible, and oxygen saturation dropped back down to less than 40%. The authors suspected the possibility of TEF considering the period of intake and the excessive air volume seen in the stomach in the chest radiograph taken before the surgery. Hence, the endotracheal tube was inserted until one lung ventilation was possible and then retreated while auscultating to secure onto the location where the pulmonary sound from both lungs became equal. The adjusted position of the endotracheal tube was 15 cm based on the top front teeth. A PIP of 25-30 cmH2O and a tidal volume of 80-100 ml were maintained. In the next insertion of the endoscope, A PIP of 30 cmH2O and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained but abdominal inflation was excessive so air in the stomach was partially removed with the endoscope, and the operating doctor was required to use the minimal amount of air for the surgery to proceed. A PIP of 25-30 cmH2O, a tidal volume of 50-80 ml, and oxygen saturation of 100% were maintained during the procedure, and the battery was removed.
After the removal of the battery, the vital signs were blood pressure 96/69 mmHg, heart rate 152 beats/min, and 100% oxygen saturation. The patient was not extubated but moved to postoperative intensive care, and after pediatrics observed vital signs for about 3 hours to verify that there were no abnormalities, extubation was done. Subsequent vital sign checks and physical exam were normal, and there were no abnormalities found in the blood test. Moreover, the right main bronchus appeared on the screen in the postoperative esophagography (), and the chest CT scan found TEF at 1.4 cm in the upper carina ().

4340,18,HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events,risk,integer,pmc-4214496-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old male was hospitalized with intermittent pain in the right abdomen that had persisted for one week. The medical history revealed hypertension, but no history of trauma and radiation exposure or a family history of genetic diseases. Physical examination showed a large, hard, immobile mass with a smooth surface, ~6×6 cm in size. Laboratory tests revealed a small increase in the serum creatinine level to 120 μmol/l (normal range, 40–110 μmol/l), while the remaining results, including that for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were normal. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan () showed a large, dense mass, with calcification, located below the right kidney, an oppressed upper ureter and thickening of the renal fascia. An exploratory laparotomy discovered a stiff calcified immobile retroperitoneal mass of 5×6 cm, with a wide base below the right kidney. The mass could not be completely resected of its attachment to the surrounding organs. Pathology revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle- and polygonal-shaped tumor cells, with a banded or irregular osteoid matrix. The tumor cells exhibited varying degrees of atypia and visible mitotic figures (). From these results, a diagnosis of extraskeletal osteosarcoma was formed. Immunohistochemistry showed the positive expression of vimentin and S-100, whereas examination of cytokeratin, cluster of differentiation (CD)117, CD34, epithelial membrane antigen, melanoma, B-cell lymphoma-2 and CD99 staining was negative.
Two months after the surgery, CT imaging () revealed a retroperitoneal ESOS near the right upper ureter, with a large amount of calcification. The imaging also revealed multiple metastases of the hepatic capsular, renal fascia and peritoneum. After four months, the patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy due to tumor relapse. The surgery demonstrated that the retroperitoneal mass of ~10×10 cm in size was closely adhered to the right kidney, ileocecum and the posterior abdominal wall. There was significant chondroid tissue present on the omental tumors, which were 0.5×1.5 cm in size. Only the omental metastases were cut, and cytoreductive surgery was not viable due to the multiple metastases of the abdominal cavity and the severe adhesion with the retroperitoneal tissue. Pathological examination showed that the tumor tissue was predominantly composed of spindle-shaped cells and differentiated immature bone tissue. The cells showed mild-moderate atypia and were ordered in a storiform arrangement, with visible mitotic figures. From these results, a diagnosis of an omental osteosarcoma was formed.
The patient was administered two courses of chemotherapy, where each cycle lasted 28 days. During each cycle Endostar (15 mg/day for the first 14 days), cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on the first day) and epirubicin (25 mg/m2 for the first three days) were administered intravenously, but this had minimal efficacy. Five months after the second surgery, the patient experienced vomiting and an incomplete intestinal obstruction was suspected. The patient therefore underwent a third exploratory laparotomy. The surgery revealed a 25×30-cm right retroperitoneal mass oppressing the descending section of the duodenum and surrounded the descending colon, and a 1.1×1.2-cm implantation metastasis nodule in the outer membrane of the gastric body anterior wall (). The liver and spleen exhibited no metastatic nodules. A gastrojejunostomy and ileocolonic anastomosis were performed, and the pathology () revealed components of an osteosarcoma in the outer stomach wall, in accordance with a gastric wall osteosarcoma metastasis. The serum ALP level gradually increased to 199 U/l (normal range, 40–130 U/l). The patient eventually succumbed to retroperitoneal ESOS one year after the first surgery.",What is the patient's HEART score?,"{'age': [52, 'years'], 'Hypertension history': True, 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': False, 'Suspicion History': 'Slightly suspicious', 'Diabetes mellitus criteria for CCI rule': False, 'parent or sibling with Cardiovascular disease before age 65': False, 'atherosclerotic disease': False, 'Electrocardiogram Test': 'Normal', 'hypercholesterolemia': False, 'obesity': False, 'smoking': False, 'Initial troponin': 'less than or equal to normal limit'}",2,2,2,"The current HEART Score is 0.

At conception, her father was 31 years old, and her mother was 30 years old. She was delivered in good general condition, without asphyxia or hypoxia. She was born at term but displayed features of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) during pregnancy. Her birth weight was 2100 g (<3 percentile), and her height was 44 cm (<3rd percentile). From day 3 on, the baby was exclusively artificially fed until 2 years old, which resulted in gradual low weight gain. Her psychomotor development was normal. She started to practice speaking at 12 months but walked at 19 months. At school age, she found it difficult to learn, especially in math, and the score was usually less than 20 (out of 100 points). Short stature was noted at birth but became more noticeable from the age of 12 years; however, her parents did not record the growth rate per year in detail. She was first seen in the endocrine clinic at age 14.5 years and was referred for the assessment of short stature.
At admission, we performed a systematic physical examination. She was noted to have partial lipodystrophy as well as a peculiar face, looking considerably older than her age. On examination, she was found to have short stature (137.3 cm, −4.0 SD), low weight (27 kg, −2.7 SD), and low BMI (14.3 kg/m2, −2.5 SD). Her face showed typical features, such as microcephaly, triangular shape, small chin, and so on. Physical examination showed abnormal abduction of the elbow joint (elbow valgus) and brachydactyly, short fingers/toes, metacarpal sign and bilateral toe deformities (Figure ). Her puberty stage was Tanner III but no menarche.
Her father was 170 cm in height and grew significantly at the age of 14 years. Her mother was 153 cm in height with menarche at the age of 13 years. Her younger brother was 6 years old and maintained a height above the 50th percentile of the population with the same age and gender.

Seizure frequency was unchanged. Her home medications were valproic acid, clobazam, potassium bromide, and diazepam. On arrival to the emergency room she was found to be hypotensive (65/39 mmHg), tachycardic, and febrile. She received two normal saline boluses. Her laboratory results in emergency room included serum sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 171 mEq/L, bicarbonate 24 mEq/L, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.57 mg/dL, calcium 9.2 mg/dL, blood glucose of 60 mg/dL, and valproic acid level 23.7 mcg/L (therapeutic level 50–100 mcg/L), and normal liver function tests were performed.

In the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patient remained stable, received intravenous fluids, was tested positive for influenza, and started on oseltamivir. Repeat electrolyte panel on multiple occasions, as shown in , had hyperchloremia (154–171 mEq/L) with negative anion gap (−40 to −52 mEq/L). Due to persistent hyperchloremia and as the patient takes potassium bromide for the past two years for refractory seizures possibility of bromide toxicity was considered. On day one of admission to PICU, potassium bromide therapy was stopped and serum bromide level was sent. The bromide level was 691 mcg/mL (normal therapeutic range 200–1000 mcg/mL). Despite normal bromide level in our patient potassium bromide was temporarily withheld and continued on IV hydration therapy.

He had experienced a 2-kg weight loss over the last few days. His usual medications included aspirin 100 mg q24 h, atorvastatin 40 mg q24 h, and metformin 850 mg q8 h, which had been switched to dapagliflozin 20 days before, due to poor glycemic control, with HbA1c 12% (108 mmol/mol). His vital signs included a heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate 33 rpm, blood pressure 142/70 mmHg, temperature 36.1°C, and body mass index 22.5 kg/m2. On physical examination, somnolence, dry skin and mucous membranes, a Kussmaul breathing pattern, and a capillary refill of 3 sec were observed.

The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. Because of the right bundle branch block was not previously known, a new troponin test was performed six hours later with a peak value of 4.28 ng/mL. Treatment with crystalloids, continuous infusion of intravenous insulin, and administration of potassium and sodium bicarbonate were begun in the emergency room (ER). Due to a poor response over the first two hours, with the persistence of lactic acidosis, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where more aggressive rehydration with crystalloids was started, without further modifications of the original therapeutic plan.
Two days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the endocrinology ward. Because of his coronary risk factors and the elevated troponin on admission, a coronary angiography was performed, showing triple-vessel disease. Successful bypass surgery without extracorporeal circulation was performed a few days later, with internal mammary artery grafts to the anterior descendent and marginal obtuse arteries and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 101.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 101.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 101.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 101.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 101.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 5.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 18.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 18.0 mEq/L / 19.0 mEq/L = 0.947. The patient's delta ratio is 0.947."

He drank wine socially but never used tobacco products or illicit drugs and lived on a rural property with private well water.
The week before admission, he was working on this property and drank lots of well water. He developed congestion and muscle soreness, followed by a productive cough with blood-streaked sputum, wheezing, and shortness of breath. He went to the closest emergency department. His temperature was 37.8°C, heart rate 104/min, respirations 20/min, blood pressure 167/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air.

He referred severe psychomotor symptoms as well as anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation, weakness, diaphoresis, and decreased visual acuity occurring at any time of the day and improved by eating. Upon further questioning, our patient, who worked as a truck driver and whose symptoms had reflected poorly in his workplace, also expressed overall discomfort with life and wishes of death due to the intensity of his symptoms. He had no history of tobacco smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Medications taken prior to admission included candesartan 16 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg once a day for hypertension.
During the following weeks, the symptoms increased in severity and frequency, with continued unremitting anxiety and weakness accompanied by loss of consciousness and extreme burning sensation in his entire body. After this acute episode, he was evaluated by a primary care physician in a local hospital and hospitalized for 4 days, where he continued to present recurrent episodes of irritability and aggression to self and others. He was discharged and referred for psychologic evaluation by mental health services at another institution. No specific diagnoses were given.
Upon release from mental evaluation, he was evaluated by a third physician, who performed a 3-hour postprandial blood glucose test which revealed a blood glucose level of 58 mg/dL. Suspecting an insulinoma, our patient was admitted to a third-level hospital, and upon arrival his vital signs were: afebrile (37 °C), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 161/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. A physical examination revealed an oriented, well-nourished, and hydrated patient, without any stigmata on skin, a normocephalic and atraumatic head, and no masses or lesions. His eyes and ear, nose, and throat examinations were all within normal limits. His lungs were clear to auscultation without any added sounds, and heart sounds had a regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. An abdominal examination revealed a soft and nontender abdomen without any masses or organomegaly. Extremities showed no deformities, edema, skin discoloration, swelling, or tenderness. A neurological examination was within normal limits and showed an alert patient oriented to person, time, and place with fluent speech and comprehension. Cranial nerves II–XII were intact, with steady gait, with grossly intact sensation in all extremities. The reflexes were symmetric and 2+ at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles and had full strength in all extremities. Initial laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin level of 15.7 g/dL (normal range, 13.7–17.5 g/dL), white blood cell count of 9.51 K/uL (normal range, 4.23–9.07), and calcium levels of 9.60 mg/dL (normal range, 8.42–10.22).
He was placed on the standard 72-hour fast to induce a hypoglycemic episode and became symptomatic after 20 hours. Further laboratory testing revealed blood glucose of 29 mg/dL (normal range, 100–125 mg/dL), increased insulin at 426 mIU/L (normal range, 2.6–24.9 mIU/L), and C-peptide levels of 12.83 ng/mL (normal range, 0.5–2.0 ng/mL). Sulfonylurea levels, abdominal ultrasound, and contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were also performed without findings. Prolactin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin, and calcium levels, as well as MRI of his brain were normal, ruling out multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1).
Prior to imaging, liver and renal function tests were performed, revealing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 27 U/L (normal range, 21–72), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 24 U/L (normal rang, 17–59), and creatinine levels of 0.89 mg/dL (normal range, 0.66–1.25). Urine analysis revealed no abnormal findings. After negative initial imaging, a triple phased computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, with an early arterial phase revealing a 1.8 × 1.6 cm hypervascular mass located at the tail of the pancreas (Figs. , ). Both kidneys had normal size and morphology, and slight hepatomegaly was shown as well as round nodules less than 10 mm in size in segments 3, 7, and 8.
At the completion of imaging studies, our patient was presented to the surgical department and scheduled for distal pancreatectomy in addition to a splenectomy due to the tumor’s close proximity to his spleen.
During the course of surgery an incidental appendectomy was also performed. A 4.5 × 3.5 × 1.5 cm specimen (Fig. ) was collected during surgery and sent for pathologic analysis; the pathologic analysis reported the diagnosis of insulinoma, an encapsulated mass within the specimen that measured 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.0 cm and is consistent with the findings on CT scan.
Upon microscopic evaluation, histologic analysis revealed pancreatic tissue organized into islets within a vascularized stroma interspersed by hyaline tissue (Fig. ). Surgical margins were clear of invasion and no metastasis was found in liver or abdominal lymph nodes.
Our patient had no complications during the immediate postoperative period, in which he was tested for glucose (190 mg/dL, normal range < 126 mg/dL), lipase (207 U/L, normal range < 160 U/L), and calcium (8.5 mg/dL, normal range, 8.5–10.2 mg/dL), and administered omeprazole (40 mg intravenously once per day), insulin glargine (100 UI subcutaneous injection once per day), atenolol (100 mg orally once per day), HCTZ (25 mg orally once per day), metoclopramide (10 mg intravenously every 8 hours), nalbuphine (10 mg intravenously every 8 hours), and ceftriaxone (1 g intravenously every 12 hours). During the third postoperative day (POD), elevated respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and chest auscultation of diminished breaths sounds with rhonchi, pointed toward a diagnosis of left lobar pneumonia with pleural effusion. However, he was discharged on the fifth POD and prescribed ambulatory management and follow-up by endocrinology, pulmonology, and internal medicine units. On the ninth POD, he returned to our hospital with acute pain and serohematic secretions at the surgical site and was managed with drainage of the seroma and intravenously administered ketorolac (30 mg intravenously twice a day). A vaccination scheme was established on the 19th POD follow-up visit and started on the 18th POD with Prevnar-13® (pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine, diphtheria CRM197 protein), followed by Influenza (34th POD), and diphtheria and tetanus (DT) booster (53rd POD). On POD 21, he returned to our emergency room with acute pain, 10/10 intensity of both left quadrants. Laboratory results returned “within normal limits” and he was discharged on ambulatory management. He remains asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up and is currently being treated with ciprofibrate (100 mg orally once per day), amlodipine (10 mg orally once per day), enalapril (20 mg orally once per day), and aspirin (81 mg orally once per day)",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [37.0, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [93.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [19.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [9510.0, 'µL']}",2,2,2,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 37.0 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 93.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 9510.0 count/µL. To convert 9510.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 9510.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 9510000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 19.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2."
2109,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-5892612-1,Extracted,"In April 2014, a 31-year-old woman presented to our hospital with preexisting diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma (made 6 years earlier). Her medical history provided the following clinical course: ultrasound detection of a lesion (1.7×1.3 cm) in the posterior right lobe of the liver in 2008 and consistent detection of increasing amounts and growth of lesions yearly, with the largest mass measured by ultrasound being 4.3×3.0 cm. In 2012, the patient developed sporadic episodes of confusion, blurred vision, trembling hands, palpitations, and sweating, which resolved spontaneously and usually within 10–15 min. Sequential consultations with a neurologist and psychiatrist led to psychological diagnosis of hysteria or conversion disorder. The symptoms continued to occur and with increased frequency, appearing to correspond with physical activity and to be relieved following food intake. The patient developed a preference for sweet taste and her weight increased by 20 kg. In March 2014, the patient underwent a blood glucose test (fingertip prick) and was found to be hypoglycemic (2.52 mmol/L; normal range: 3.6–6.1 mmol/L), prompting her presentation to our hospital. She did not have any family history of endocrine tumors or diseases.
We performed a complete physical examination upon her admission, and general findings included height of 165 cm, weight of 93 kg, and no palpable lymph nodes in the neck, axilla, or inguinal region. Abdominal examination produced no remarkable findings. Serology testing showed fasting serum glucose 3.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3.6–6.1 mmol/mL), meanwhile serum insulin of 193.3 µIU/mL (normal range: 2.6–24.9 µIU/mL) and serum C-peptide of 9.6 ng/mL (normal range: 1.1–4.4 ng/mL), chromogranin A (CgA) of 19.71 ng/mL (normal: <100 ng/mL), and gastrin of 51.6 pg/mL (normal: <100 ng/mL); the lowest postprandial blood glucose level was 1.8 mmol/L. Abdomen contrast-enhanced CT imaging showed multiple lesions in the liver (largest being 4.3×3.5 cm) and one enhanced lesion (3.5 cm) located at the proximal jejunum; all lesions were intensified by contrast, and the pancreas appeared normal ( images).
The patient then underwent liver biopsy. Histological analysis indicated the lesions to be well differentiated and of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) type, grade G1. Immuno-histochemical analysis showed the lesions to be CgA(+), Syn(+), CD56(+), CK8/18(+), Ki-67(+2%), and insulin focal positive (–). Octreoscan showed high expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) in the jejunum area, liver tumors, and mesenteric lymph nodes, but no expression of SSTR was detected in any portion of the pancreas (). 68Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT confirmed the lesion located at the jejunum section, below the pancreas body, where glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression was detected and the most hypercaptant area was located (standard uptake value [SUV], 21.7); these findings supported the lesion to be of NET origin, located outside of the pancreas ().
The diagnosis of malignant insulinoma derived from ectopic pancreas was made. This patient was highly suspected of having multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient’s head showed Rathke’s cyst within the pituitary gland (8.6×5.6 mm, as shown in ). Ultrasound of the parathyroid showed mild hyperplasia, which was accompanied by a slightly elevated serum level of parathyroid hormone (PTH; 104.2 pg/mL, normal range: 12–88 pg/mL). Serum and urine levels of growth hormone and calcium were normal, and no symptoms related to the Rathke’s cyst were observed.
The patient’s multiple metastases precluded surgical therapy to resect all of the insulin-secreting tumors. Thus, in order to control the patient’s symptoms and suppress tumor growth, we prescribed everolimus (10 mg po qd) plus long-acting SSA octreotide (20 mg i.m. Q21d; Sandostatin LAR, Novartis) starting from June 2014. One week after the treatment initiation, hypoglycemia did not recur. Over the next 4 months of treatment, the largest lesion shrank to 2.2×2.1 cm, the amount of lesions reduced, and the jejunum lesion shrank to 1.8 cm, showing an overall partial tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria.
During the treatment course, the patient developed oral mucositis (grade 2), rashes, and recurrent respiratory infection (grade 2) related to the everolimus administration; these issues lessened upon gradual decrease of the everolimus dose (from 10 to 5 mg qd, and then to 5 mg orally every other day). Since the tumor remained stable during the dosage modification and the patient had experienced so many adverse events related to the drug, the everolimus was stopped in March 2015, from which time that patient was continued on the SSA alone as maintenance treatment. Till the date of this report, the SSA treatment has continued uninterrupted (for 3 years now), and no decision has been made on its cessation.
The patient provided written informed consent to authorize use and disclosure of her protected health information for publication.
The patient attended regular follow-up clinic visits every 2–3 months for the past 3 years; at the time of the writing of this report, the latest follow-up visit had occurred in June 2017. The patient has remained euglycemic and free of symptoms. Her serum level of PTH remained normal, being 86.3 pg/mL (normal range: 12–88 pg/mL) at the latest follow-up visit. Ultimately, the patient tolerated the treatment with SSA alone well, without incidence of side effects and with partial tumor response. The latest images taken by enhanced MRI in June 2017 () shows the partial response of the tumor located in liver and jejunum compared to base line status.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

7459,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-8422010-1,Extracted,"A 48-year-old male patient (186 cm, 88 kg) was referred to our orthopedic outpatient clinic with a history of atraumatic persisting left shoulder pain lasting for several months. Physiotherapy, oral analgesics, and subacromial infiltrations showed no lasting effect. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an RCT of M. supraspinatus (Patte Grade I; Goutallier/Fuchs Type I) and M. subscapularis (Lafosse Type I) [, , ].
The patient underwent ARCR using a suture bridge-like construct (SpeedBridge™ [SB], Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) for rotator cuff repair as well as an LHB tenodesis through one BioComposite SwiveLock™ (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA). The cranial part of the partially torn subscapularis tendon was attached to the LHB anchor.
At 6-week follow-up, the patient showed an adequate range of passive motion and no signs of shoulder stiffness. Nine weeks postoperatively, the patient suffered a low-velocity trauma to his left shoulder. He presented to the emergency room with immobilizing pain rated 9/10 on the numeric analog scale. Radiographic examination (, ) and a computer tomography scan (CT, , ) revealed an isolated fracture of the proximal humeral head (AO/OTA fracture and dislocation classification 11C1.3) []. The fracture line was located right at the lateral site of the suture bridge construct close to the anatomic neck (Neer Type II, []). Due to a displacement of 1 cm, surgical refixation was advised.
Under general anesthesia, the fracture site was exposed using a delta split approach. Total reruptures of previously reconstructed rotator cuff tendons were detected, and anchor material was removed. The fracture was reduced, and definitive fixation was performed with a PHILOS™-Plate system (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). Rotator cuff tendons were reconstructed and additionally attached to the plate through Ethibond® fibers (Ethicon, Somerville, Massachusetts) in Mason-Allen technique.
Post-operative radiographs showed good reduction of the fracture so that post-operative rehabilitation following a standardized protocol was initiated ().
At 3-month follow-up, the fracture healed anatomically with the patient’s passive range of motion already within normal limits. Constant score was 68 and improved to 92 points at 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Radiographic examination at 1-year follow-up revealed adequate fracture consolidation (, ).",What is the patient's body surface area?

2120,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-5253166-1,Extracted,"An 8-year-and-1-month old Caucasian female presented to her pediatrician with complaints of nocturnal enuresis and hyperactivity. Child was adopted at 2 years of age along with her younger sibling due to history of parental neglect by biological parents. Adoptive parents reported hyperactivity as a major concern. Physical examination revealed her weight to be 24.8 Kg (25th percentile for age) and height to be 128.7 cm (35th percentile for age). Vitals were stable and blood pressure at presentation was 113/75 mmHg. A comprehensive neurologic exam by her pediatrician revealed fine tremors in the upper extremity. Laboratory workup was initiated and a comprehensive metabolic panel revealed sodium (Na) of 124 mEq/L. She was referred to our medical center for comprehensive evaluation. Initial exam revealed an otherwise healthy child who was alert and oriented in time, space, and person. Vitals including blood pressure were normal for age. Admission chemistry and other laboratory values are shown in .
While the causes of hyponatremia can be extensive [, ], her presentation was consistent with euvolemic hyponatremia suggestive of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). Evaluation by us confirmed our impression of SIADH with serum Na of 123 mEq/L, serum osmolality of 264 mOsm/Kg (ref range 280–300), and urine osmolality of 614 mOsm/Kg (300–900). Adrenal function as assessed by early morning cortisol of 8.6 mcg/dL and thyroid function tests were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintense, nonenhancing enlargement of the right hypothalamus, concerning for a hypothalamic glioma (). Other workups including ultrasound of abdomen, pelvis, chest X-ray, and a PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test to rule out tuberculosis were essentially negative.
Initial management consisted of fluid restriction, furosemide (at a dose of 2 mg/Kg/day divided into three doses), and salt and potassium chloride supplementation. Though this resulted in her Na levels gradually improving to a maximum value of 130 mEq/L, the fluid restriction regimen was very difficult to follow and family expressed ongoing frustration. Given limitations for treatment options in treating children with SIADH and with Na levels trending down (range: 121–124 mEq/L), we initiated Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptor antagonist therapy with oral tolvaptan. Current literature is lacking data on use of these agents in children. So tolvaptan therapy was started at a dose of 7.5 mg under close supervision in the inpatient setting. The dose initiated was half of the lowest approved dose in adults which is 15 mg []. Initial response to therapy was dramatic in terms of correction of hyponatremia, with Na improving to low 130 mEq/L range.
With initiation of tolvaptan therapy, her Na levels improved allowing us to loosen our recommendation on water intake to a maximum of 2.5 L/day. Liberalization of fluid intake with this regimen seemed to help the family initially. Gradually though, Na levels trended down because her water intake was much more than her urine output with the therapy (). Child psychology and later child psychiatry were involved to help family and child be compliant with the fluid restriction. Dose of tolvaptan had to be increased gradually to a maximum of 30 mg daily. In an effort to keep the Na levels up, water restriction to 2.5 L/day was encouraged. But even this degree of fluid restriction proved to be difficult as she developed compulsive drinking behaviors. She would sneak water from bottles in trash cans, bathtub, faucet, and even toilets.
With ongoing management issues due to behavior problems and recent black box warning issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for liver failure in patients on long-term therapy [], decision was made to wean tolvaptan. She was weaned off V2 antagonist therapy over a period of 6 months. While her persistent hyponatremia was concerning, the limited benefits we were observing with treatment and the potential side effects led us to make this decision. Following this, patient was briefly on oral furosemide, which was eventually discontinued as long-term furosemide is known to exacerbate chronic hyponatremia [].
She was also noted to develop hypertension with blood pressures ranging around 140/106 mmHg requiring input from pediatric nephrology during the course of her treatment. She was initially started on amlodipine 2.5 mg twice a day but needed the addition of enalapril maleate in 4 months due to poor control of her blood pressure. She is currently on amlodipine 2.5 mg twice a day and enalapril 10 mg twice a day. Secondary causes of hypertension were ruled out by pediatric nephrology team. While hypertension was noticed after initiation of therapy, this is not a reported side effect of V2 receptor antagonist therapy. Her hypertension continued after she was weaned of tolvaptan therapy. It is unlikely that the hypertension was caused by volume overload as her weight continued to be stable. Etiology of hypertension is unclear as preliminary workups including renal ultrasound and renal Doppler were all within normal limits.
A complete neuropsychological assessment revealed IQ to be low normal. Patient had reading, attention, and auditory processing problems making school more challenging for her. She had no difficulties in doing grade level mathematics and spelling. These contributed to ongoing difficulties at school. Due to the well-known determinant effect of hyponatremia on bone health [], DXA scan was done which revealed Z-score of −1.8 at AP spine and −1.1 at total body less head region. Since she never suffered from any pathological fracture, education was provided to optimize calcium and vitamin D intake. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels checked periodically were always in the sufficient range (>30 ng/mL).
Currently, she is off all pharmacological therapy for her hyponatremia and her sodium levels range within 113–118 mEq/L. Fluid restriction is encouraged but not very strictly enforced due to fear of her developing unhealthy drinking habits. She is performing at age appropriate level in school. Regular monitoring for endocrinopathies by stimulation testing has so far been normal.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

The patient reported edema of the face and lower limbs, particularly in the afternoon, and he had not received any special treatment for this symptom.
No other relevant history of past illness was reported.
No other relevant family history was reported.
On examination, the patient presented with multiple nodules and lumps with a smooth surface that could be seen throughout the body (Figure ). Enlargement of the cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes was clearly observed.
Laboratory examinations revealed severe proteinuria (3.77 g/24 h; normal range, 0–0.15 g/24 h), hypoalbuminemia (1.8 g/dL), hyperlipidemia (cholesterol 15.7 mmoL, triglyceride 3.34 mmol/L), and increased serum creatinine levels (152 μmoL; normal range, 44–133 μmoL). These clinical parameters suggested that the patient’s symptoms were a result of nephrotic syndrome.
A kidney biopsy was performed and the analysis of nine glomeruli revealed one glomerulus indicative of glomerulosclerosis and one indicative of segmental glomerulosclerosis with peripheral podocytosis, vacuolation, and granular degeneration in the renal tubular epithelial cells (Figure and ). These pathological findings were indicative of FSGS, not otherwise specified (NOS). Immunohistochemistry of the kidney revealed that the glomerular capillary loop, peritubular capillary, and arterioles were positive for CD34 (Figure ), and the proximal tubule cells were positive for CD117 (Figure ) but negative for DOG1. Fat degeneration and necrosis were observed in the lymph node, and no tumor metastasis was revealed (Figure ). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the skin showed spindle cell tumor-like hyperplasia, which was slightly heteromorphic with focal necrosis and rarely mitotic (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CD34, Bcl-2, CD99, Ki67, and vimentin but negative for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and S-100. Representative immunohistochemical staining for CD34 is shown in Figure . The diagnosis was a desmoid tumor (DT) based on the above immunohistochemistry results.
Then, gastroscopy was performed and the results revealed a 0.6 cm mucosal mass that was hard to the touch, and poor mobility could be seen in the greater curvature of the stomach (Figure ). Several 0.4-2 cm masses were observed in the anterior wall of the middle and upper of the gastric fundus with fractured surfaces and fresh blood (Figure ). Moreover, pathological examination revealed the destruction of the gastric solid membrane structure and spindle cell tumor-like hyperplasia with mild dysplasia (Figure ), and epithelioid cells were occasionally seen with 6-8 mitotic figures/50 high power fields (Figure ). CD117 (Figure ), CD34 (Figure ), and SMA were positive by immunohistochemistry, and DOG1 was probably positive, and S-100 and CK were negative. These findings supported the diagnosis of GIST. Additional immunohistochemistry revealed that the skin was positive for CD117 (Figure ) and DOG1 (Figure ), the two most sensitive and specific markers for the diagnosis of GIST[]. In addition, a heterozygous missense mutation was found in the NPHP4 gene of the patient (NPHP4: NM_015102: exon17: c.2198G>A: p.G733D), which explained the occurrence of GIST and FSGS and indicated that this was not a random association[].","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [64, 'years'], 'creatinine': [152.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Male'}",44.461,42.238,46.684,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 64 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 152.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 152.0 µmol. To convert 152.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 152.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000152 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000152 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.017 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.017 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.017 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 17.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 17.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.7 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 152.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.7 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.7/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**64 * 1.0 = 44.461.

3285,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-4421527-1,Extracted,"A 55-year-old Filipino man with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, CKD (not taking activated vitamin D derivatives or phosphate binders) and coronary artery disease presented to a hospital in the Philippines with abdominal pain, nausea and post-prandial, non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting. His pre-hospitalization serum creatinine concentration was 3.0 mg/dL. An anterolateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed, and emergent coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery distal to a drug-eluting stent (DES) placed ~2 years earlier. A second DES was successfully placed, and he was discharged home on clopidogrel, aspirin, isosorbide mononitrate, metoprolol, rosuvastatin, imidapril and lansoprazole.
Four weeks prior to admission at our hospital, he was admitted to another hospital in the Philippines with intractable nausea and vomiting, fatigue, generalized weakness, constipation and a 30-lb weight loss. Symptomatic treatment was provided; on physical examination, he was noted to have a palpable left anterior neck mass. Serum chemistries showed markedly elevated serum calcium of 17.28 mg/dL and a serum creatinine of 3.8 mg/dL.
An abdominal ultrasound showed possible renal parenchymal disease, and an abdominal non-contrast computed tomography (CT) was normal except for two non-obstructing, hyper-dense foci (thought to represent stones) in the left kidney. In an attempt to treat hypercalcaemia, normal saline infusion (200 mL/h) and furosemide were begun. A narrow corrected QT (QTc) interval was observed, and he was transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) for closer monitoring.
On the next day, the serum calcium was 14.29 mg/dL and a narrow QTc interval remained. Haemodialysis was recommended; during catheter insertion, the patient's pulse and blood pressure dropped. Atropine and a dopamine infusion were started, but the patient developed chest pain and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia followed by supraventricular tachycardia, which converted to normal sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone. On the same day, a neck ultrasound revealed a 4.5 × 1.2 × 1.2-cm soft tissue mass behind the left lobe of the thyroid as well as a cystic component in the inferior pole with no gross calcification.
The patient's serum calcium was 16.36 mg/dL the following day, with serum phosphorus 4.87 mg/dL. Haemodialysis was attempted, but the catheter malfunctioned. A tunnelled haemodialysis catheter was subsequently placed, but profuse bleeding at the site prohibited immediate use. In the interim, he was treated with additional normal saline, subcutaneous calcitonin and ibandronate, which lowered his serum calcium to 13.77 mg/dL. The serum creatinine increased to 4.99 mg/dL.
Approximately 3 weeks prior to admission at our hospital, he was found to have an elevated PTH of 496.2 pg/mL. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry demonstrated osteoporosis (spine T-score −3.28, hip T-score −2.70). A 201Tl/99mTc pertechnetate thyroid scan revealed a minimally enlarged thyroid (4.8 × 2.4 cm right lobe, 4.2 × 2.7 cm left lobe), but suboptimal radioactivity accumulation precluded parenchymal evaluation. Delayed static images of the neck after 99mTc-sestamibi injection showed abnormal radiopharmaceutical accumulation in the region of the superior and inferior left parathyroid glands suggestive of adenoma or hyperplasia. Surgical excision was recommended.
With continued hypotension requiring a continuous dopamine infusion, repeat coronary angiography was performed and showed the recently placed DES to be patent. Cardiology recommended 6 months of clopidogrel therapy before proceeding with parathyroid surgery. He was transferred out of the CCU 2 days later, and cinacalcet was started. The serum calcium initially decreased to 12.49 mg/dL (with serum phosphorus 2.9 mg/dL and serum creatinine 2.5 mg/dL), but increased to 14.69 mg/dL (with serum phosphorus 2.9 mg/dL and serum creatinine 2.6 mg/dL) 2 days later, after which his cinacalcet dose was doubled and another dose of intravenous ibandronate was given. An interdisciplinary care conference concluded that continued medical management of the patient's hypercalcaemia was ineffective. The family requested that the patient be transferred to our hospital for surgery.
In preparation for surgery, a contrast CT scan of the head, neck and thorax showed a 1.8 × 1.4 × 4.5-cm heterogeneously enhancing, well-defined mass lesion spanning the posterior aspect of the left thyroid lobe. Mild compression of the trachea with slight rightward deviation was present. Repeat PTH was 1142.89 pg/mL.
Approximately 1 week prior to admission at our institution, he received another dose of intravenous ibandronate and underwent haemodialysis, which lowered the serum calcium from 16.16 mg/dL (with the pre-dialysis serum creatinine 3.0 mg/dL) to 14.97 mg/dL. The following day, his total serum calcium was 17.28 mg/dL and he developed a fever; vancomycin was started for presumed tunnelled catheter infection. A new permanent haemodialysis catheter was inserted, and he underwent daily haemodialysis, which lowered his total serum calcium to 12.97 mg/dL. He was subsequently transferred.
Upon admission to our hospital, the patient's serum calcium was 15.0 mg/dL. The PTH was 1347 pg/mL and increased to 1890 pg/mL the following day. Ultrasound of the thyroid () showed a normal thyroid gland with a 3.7 × 1 × 1.3-cm left lobe and a 4.4 × 1.3 × 1.8-cm right lobe. A large, elongated, hypoechoic, hypervascular mass with internal cystic change measuring 5 × 1.7 × 1 cm was found behind the entire left lobe of the thyroid. Intravenous fluids, furosemide and subcutaneous calcitonin were begun. Serum calcium initially fell to 13.4 mg/dL (with serum phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL) but rose again to 15.7 mg/dL (with serum phosphorus 5.0 mg/dL), and haemodialysis was re-initiated.
Based on a working diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma, the patient underwent the planned left parathyroidectomy with concomitant left thyroid lobectomy on the following day. Intraoperative PTH was 2462 pg/mL prior to incision, which decreased to 310 pg/mL immediately after removal and to 144.5 pg/mL within 10 min after removal. Gross pathologic findings included a 4-cm, in greatest dimension, portion of left thyroid with a 3.7 × 1.8 × 1.8-cm solitary abnormal parathyroid gland weighing 2 g. Microscopic examination () revealed a densely cellular proliferation of neoplastic chief cells demonstrating uniformly round, regular nuclei with smooth nuclear membranes, small variably prominent nucleoli and abundant granular cytoplasm. Features (as proposed by Schantz and Castleman in []) suspicious for carcinoma—thick tumour capsule, invasion into adjacent tissues, dense sclerosis within tumour and increased mitotic figures (>1/high-power field)—were noticeably absent.
One day after surgery, the PTH declined to 7 pg/mL and the serum calcium declined to 12.1 mg/dL (with serum phosphorus 3.5 mg/dL). His calcium continued to decline until 4 days after discharge with a total serum calcium of 8.2 mg/dL (with serum phosphorus 1.8 mg/dL) (). His serum calcium remained stable at 8.7 mg/dL ~6 months after discharge. He required no calcium or phosphorus supplementation.
The serum creatinine at admission to our hospital was 3.1 mg/dL. Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler revealed normal-sized kidneys (11.6 cm right long axis diameter, 11.4 cm left long axis diameter) exhibiting minimal bilateral pelviectasis. A minimally complex cyst with a septa measuring ~13 × 16 × 12 mm in diameter and a second small, simple cyst measuring ~8 × 10 × 9 mm in diameter were found in the left kidney. Numerous, scattered, echogenic foci were seen within the kidneys bilaterally, which may reflect small calcified renal stones. However, there was no evidence for obstruction. The patient has done well with a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL ~6 months after discharge.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [55, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.5, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male', 'Race': 'Asian'}",48.589,46.16,51.018,"The patient is 55 years old.

In computed tomography, the right thyroid lobe showed an 8 mm sized nodule. Her medical history was unremarkable. Her mouth opening was restricted to two fingers due to trismus owing to an erupting wisdom tooth. The pre-operative electrocardiogram (ECG), chest and neck radiographs, laboratory investigations and indirect laryngoscopic findings were normal. In the operation theatre, routine monitors (ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph and non-invasive blood pressure) were applied. After pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam 1.5 mg, fentanyl 80 μg, propofol 70 mg and atracurium 50 mg. On direct laryngoscopy (prior to giving the neuromuscular blocking agent), Cormack and Lehane Grading was 2B and both the vocal cords were mobile. The trachea was intubated with an ID 7 mm cuffed reinforced Lo-Contour™ flexometallic endotracheal tube (ETT) (Covidien, Mallinckrodt Medical Ltd., Athlone, Ireland) using the C-Mac D-Blade™ video laryngoscope. The tracheal cuff was inflated, and a circle system with inspiratory and expiratory tubings twice the standard length (improvised in advance) was connected. After capnographic confirmation of proper placement, the tube was fixed on the left side of the mouth at the 19 cm mark. A bispectral index-guided intravenous propofol infusion along with desflurane in 66% air-oxygen mixture was utilised for the maintenance of anaesthesia. Continuous atracurium infusion was given under peripheral nerve stimulator monitoring of neuromuscular blockade. Ventilatory parameters were adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO2 between 35 and 40 mmHg.
The patient was placed in supine position with head extended, neck flexed, right arm abducted and the left arm adducted. The robotic arms were inserted via the right axillary approach after utilising a Chung's retractor to facilitate exposure []. At the end of surgery, after reversing the neuromuscular blockade, on insertion of the video laryngoscope, we found the right true vocal cord to be immobile.

Physical exam revealed bibasilar crackles, a grade 5 crescendo-decrescendo murmur, elevated JVP, and lower extremity edema. Laboratory findings were pertinent for creatinine of 1.73, BUN of 45, and NT-pro-BNP of 10k. The rest of her physical exam and laboratory was normal. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with known left bundle branch block. 2D echocardiogram demonstrated severe aortic stenosis with mean aortic valve pressure gradient of 68.6 mmHg and peak velocity of 5.15 m/s with preserved systolic function. She received intravenous diuretics with some clinical improvement. She was seen and evaluated by cardiothoracic surgeon for evaluation of aortic valve replacement but deemed high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement with an estimated surgical mortality by Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 8.1%. Cardiac computed tomography angiography was done as part of transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation and showed severely calcified aortic leaflets with short and low left coronary system with coronary ostial height of 8.4 mm (). Special attention was paid to the left coronary leaflet calcification and the short and low coronary ostium. Coronary angiography revealed 50% LAD stent restenosis, diffuse distal LCX disease, and 90% proximal RCA stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was implanted to the right coronary artery. The decision then was made to proceed with TAVI utilizing coronary protection technique during the procedure. TAVR was then undertaken from the right femoral artery through a 14F Edwards arterial sheath. Two 300 mm long Prowater wires were advanced to the LAD and LCX arteries. With rapid ventricular pacing over a long Amplatz extra stiff wire, balloon aortic valvuloplasty using an Edward 4 × 23 mm balloon with simultaneous root aortography to see how the left main flow was performed (). There was flow compromise in the left main system to TIMI-2 flow; the wires were deformed and the large piece of calcium in the left cusp moved right over the left main coronary artery (). We therefore made decision to place two 3.5 × 12 mm Robel bare-metal stents in the LAD and LCX. An Edward 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve with rapid ventricular pacing was then deployed followed by deploying the two stents in a kissing fashion, and an excellent result was obtained (). Position of the valve and function was confirmed by aortography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The left main coronary flow was excellent.

No trauma was recollected. The symptoms had initially occurred the previous night. The patient denied any sore throat or congestion, dyspnea, chest pain or palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or rash.
The previous medical history included an excised soft tissue sarcoma of the left thigh with postoperative irradiation 5 years ago and regular follow-ups without pathological findings, as well as a benign prostatic hyperplasia and hyperuricemia. Regular medication included an uricostatic agent and an alpha receptor antagonist.
Physical examination indicated an edematous swelling of the right hand and forearm with superficial skin lesions of unknown cause, no reddening, a body temperature of 36.3 °C, a heart rate of 60 beats/min, an oxygen saturation of 94% with a respiratory rate of 19/min, and an arterial blood pressure of 156/69 mm/Hg with palpable pulses of the radial and ulnar artery, generalized tenderness upon palpation, and painfully restricted flection of all fingers. Laboratory tests showed a leukocytosis of 16,510/μl, and elevated levels for the C-reactive protein (CRP, 17.5 mg/dl) and creatine-kinase (CK, 669 U/l).
Computed tomographic imaging with application of a contrast agent (Ultravist® 300, Bayer Vital, Leverkusen, Germany) showed a generalized subcutaneous edema as well as a subfascial fluid accumulation around the musculature of the fore- and upper arm, moreover a reduction of density along the brachialis muscle. The supplying arterial blood vessels (Aa. brachialis, radialis and ulnaris) presented regularly.
Within 6 h a severe deterioration of the clinical findings occurred with progressive swelling and development of a compartment syndrome of the arm: a palm sized livid discoloration located at the medial elbow occurred, multiple blisters, a hypoesthesia of all fingers and heavy pain resistant to analgesics treatment. The radial and ulnar artery were not palpable anymore and no arterial flow was detectable using doppler sonography.
With the clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome of the upper extremity, the patient was consequently admitted to the theater for emergency surgical exploration, debridement as well as medial and lateral fasciotomy of the fore- and upper arm. An extensive excision of the necrotic tissue was performed. Blood cultures were taken as well as multiple tissue samples for histopathologic and microbiological analyses. Predominately, the forearm flexors appeared at risk (pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, palmaris longus, pronator quadratus, flexor pollicis longus). The skin and underlying fascia were affected to a lower extend and excised to healthy tissue. The resulting soft tissue defect was temporarily covered with Epigard®.
After sample collection intravenous antibiotic therapy was started with Clindamycin and Penicillin G.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the ICU. Microbiological analysis revealed group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, susceptible to Clindamycin and Penicillin G, histology a bacterial interstitial myositis with necrotic muscular fibers. Consecutively, the initially elevated blood infection parameters such as leukocyte count, and C-reactive protein levels were continuously decreasing.
However, the biochemical profile showed rising CK levels (5560 U/l) which were treated by fluid resuscitation and high-ceiling diuretics in the following to prevent an imminent crush syndrome. The morning after surgery CK levels had already decreased to 3537 U/l to further drop to 514 U/l the following day and 337 U/l another day later.
Three days after primary surgery, the patient was discharged from ICU and transferred to the general surgical ward for further observation and treatment.
The patient needed ten further visits to the theater for dressing changes but minimal further debridement prior to application of dermatotraction techniques to initiate wound closure as described previously []. Dermatotraction involved vessel loops anchored to alternate edges of the wound using skin staples. Remaining soft tissue defects of the upper arm were reconstructed with a pedicled, fasciocutaneous parascapular flap, the defects of the forearm with a free, ipsilateral anterolateral thigh flap (lateral circumflexing femoral artery perforator flap) (Fig. ). On day 43 antibiotic therapy was consecutively switched to oral Ciprofloxacin and continued for 10 more days.
After a total of five sessions of plastic reconstructive surgery, the wounds healed uneventfully, and after physiotherapy the patient was discharged from hospital 63 days after admission. Follow-up appointments were scheduled on a monthly basis at first, with continuing physio- and ergotherapy.
At the final follow-up 14 months after discharge, the flaps presented vital without any signs of inflammation or infection (Fig. ). The range of motion of the affected joints was as follows: elbow: extension/flexion 0°/0°/95°, supination/pronation 60°/0°/60°. Wrist joint: extension/flexion 50°/0°/30°, abduction/adduction 20°/0°/10°. Metacarpophalangeal joints 2–4: extension/flexion 0°/20°/80°.
An active flexion of the proximal and distal interaphalangeal joints 2–4 was not possible, as the superficial and deep flexor muscles of the forearm were significantly weakened as a result of the extensive necrosectomy. The opposition of the thumb was also partially restricted, gripping and writing was however possible even though in a limited fashion.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [156.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [69.0, 'mm hg']}",98.0,93.1,102.9,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

The patient had mid-upper abdominal pain 26 h ago, a persistent pain, severe with nausea but no vomiting. There was no waist and back pain, no chest tightness, shortness of breath, but the patient felt palpitations and fatigue. The patient has had chills since abdominal pain occurred, and the degree of abdominal pain has been increasing since the onset. We observed that the patient had a catheter inserted, and there was about 50 mL of yellow urine in the urine bag.
After a careful medical history inquiry, the patient was found to have been bedridden for a long period of time and suffered from many diseases, including hypertension, cardiac pacemaker implantation, history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prostatic hyperplasia and catheter indwelling status. The patient was diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia 8 years ago due to symptoms of impaired urination, but he refused surgery. Three years ago, the patient could not rule out urination because of prostate hyperplasia, so he chose catheterization. For so many years, patients have been living with urinary catheters, so urinary tract infections often occur.
When the patient came to the hospital, his temperature was 37.2°C, heart rate was 56 bpm, respiratory rate was 19 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 197/70 mmHg and oxygen saturation was 97%. Physical examination revealed slightly swollen abdomen and no obvious prominent lumps. Abdominal palpation showed tense abdominal muscles, a platy abdomen and obvious tenderness in the whole abdomen accompanied by rebound pain. Percussion of the abdomen indicated the presence of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Auscultation of the abdomen indicated that the sound of bowel movement in the abdominal cavity was slightly weakened.
Routine blood tests showed that the patient’s leukocyte count did not increase significantly (7.38 × 109/L), and the percentage of neutrophils was 91.2% with an increased hypersensitive C-reactive protein (132.81 mg/L). The patient’s red blood cell count was normal (4.92 × 109/L), but the platelet count was low (80 × 109/L). The significant increase in troponin (50 ng/L) and brain natriuretic peptide (630.53 pg/mL) indicated that the function of the patient’s heart was poor. Prothrombin, d-dimers and partial thromboplastin times were normal.
Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a small amount of free gas under the diaphragm and edema in part of the small intestine and intestinal wall with surrounding exudation. There was gas accumulation in the middle and upper abdomen and intestinal cavity, a small amount of effusion around the right liver, multiple cystic foci in the liver and cirrhosis. The distal end of the common bile duct showed calculi with multiple gallbladder calculi.

He underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of left renal artery. He presented subsequently with a history of recurrent episodes of seizures and persistently elevated blood pressure. MRI brain revealed vasculitis induced multiple infarcts. Right auto renal transplantation was considered due to refractory hypertension and ongoing complication. Preoperative vitals revealed GCS of 14/15, heart rate of 96/min, absent right radial pulse with blood pressure in left upper limb of 170/110mmHg. His blood investigations were normal with serum creatinine of 0.9mg%. Chest roentgenogram revealed cardiomegaly and electrocardiogram left ventricular hypertrophy.
The patient was fasted and premedicated with Syp.Triclofos 75mg.kg−1. Under standard monitoring (SpO2, non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, end-tidal CO2 monitor, temperature), anaesthesia was induced with air, oxygen and sevoflurane. The trachea was intubated following atracurium administration and the patient mechanically ventilated. Under ultrasound guidance, a 5F triple lumen catheter was sited in the right internal jugular vein. The left femoral artery was selected for direct arterial pressure monitoring. Anaesthesia was maintained with 50% mixture of air and oxygen, end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1% with morphine, fentanyl and atracurium boluses as needed. Normocarbia was maintained to preserve cerebral perfusion. Surgery was done in supine position. A good perfusion pressure of the transplanted kidney was ensured by maintaining a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg, CVP of 13-15 mmHg. Mannito 10.5g.kg−1 was infused 20 minutes before clamp release. Blood loss was replaced with fresh whole blood. Urine output was more than 0.5 ml.kg−1.hr−1 after the anastamosis.

She was referred to our tertiary care hospital for further management in view of clinically deteriorating symptoms. At the time of presentation in emergency room (ER), she had fair general condition: pulse—120/min, BP (blood pressure)—104/70 mmHg, RR (respiratory rate)—36/min, SPO2 (oxygen saturation)—64% on room air, cardiovascular system—normal, chest ex—B/L (bilateral) crepitations present, B/L decreased breath sounds, P/A (per-abdomen)—uterus 16 weeks, well contracted, nontender, P/V (per vaginum)—episiotomy healthy, lochia healthy. On reviewing her records, chest X-ray (done 24 hrs back) showed patchy peripheral extensive consolidation along with ground-glass opacities in B/L lung fields predominantly in mid and lower zones suggestive of atypical pneumonia. ECG (echocardiograph) showed sinus tachycardia. After initial management and evaluation, she was admitted in SARI (severe acute respiratory distress isolation) ward in collaboration with Medicine Department. All routine investigations, cultures, and ABG (arterial blood gas analysis) were sent. COVID-19 testing was done using nasopharyngeal swab. She was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was shifted to designated COVID-19 ICU (intensive care unit). Patient was put on NRBM (nonrebreathing mask) at 15 lt/min followed by NIV (noninvasive ventilation). Because of inability to maintain oxygen saturation, patient required intubation and was put on mechanical ventilation for a day. She was provided with supportive care guided by Government of India (GOI) guidelines, including the antiviral drug (remdesivir) and higher intravenous antibiotics with steroid therapy for 10 days. She was extubated on the very next day and was put on NIV again. Her blood reports were within normal range except indicative of infection: haemoglobin—12.2 gm/dl, TLC (total leucocyte count)—16,300, platelets—1,13,000, INR (international normalized ratio)—1.18, LFT/KFT (liver function tests/kidney function tests)—normal. Ultrasound chest was done on day 10 suggestive of B/L consolidation in left to right and no evidence of any effusion. During her hospital stay, she complained of pain left-sided abdomen. She was evaluated in conjunction with gastroenterologist. An ultrasound of the whole abdomen was done and she was diagnosed to have portal cavernoma, which did not require any active intervention. In view of persistent tachycardia, cardiology consultation was done. Her 2D echo (2-dimensional echocardiogram) revealed ejection fraction—55%, no clots, no RWMA (regional wall motion abnormalities). She was subjected to serial chest radiographs, as advised by pulmonologist, which showed a gradual resolution in sizes of patches and opacity as shown in Figures –.

Past medical history revealed complete heart block, for which permanent pacemaker was implanted 8 months ago. Airway examination revealed modified Mallampati Class I with restricted neck movements indicating difficult airway. Hematological and biochemical investigation reports were within the normal limits. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60%. The pacemaker was identified to be VITATRON E50A1D (Medtronic Inc., USA) (MODE: DDDR), in proper working condition. It was reprogrammed to asynchronous DOOO mode on the day before surgery. Defibrillator and transcutaneous pacing equipment were checked and kept ready before induction of anesthesia. Difficult airway trolley and crash cart for resuscitation were arranged and checked for all its contents. Pads for transcutaneous pacing were appropriately placed for use in case of pacemaker failure. Grounding plate of unipolar cautery was placed on the thigh of the patient. After preoxygenation, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 150 mcg and thiopentone 250 mg. Rocuronium 50 mg IV was given to facilitate intubation. Intubation was done using video laryngoscopy with 8.0-sided cuffed endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, fentanyl, and rocuronium. Cannulation of the right radial artery was done after induction of anesthesia. Cardiac output monitoring was done using FloTrac (Edward Lifesciences, CA). Acid-base status and electrolytes remained within normal limits during the intraoperative period. Total duration of anesthesia was 4 h. A total of 2.5 liters of crystalloid and 500 ml of colloid (6% HES 130/0.4) were administered during the procedure. Blood loss was minimal, and there was no requirement for transfusion of blood products. Temperature monitoring was done and was maintained in normal range using forced air warmer. At the end of procedure, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate at the end of procedure. The patient was extubated when he was fully alert with adequate reversal of neuromuscular paralysis and shifted to postanesthesia recovery unit for further observation.

8732,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-5628240-1,Extracted,"A 22-year-old woman (height 160 cm; weight 50 kg; BMI 19.5 kg/m2), gravida 1 para 0, at 16 weeks of gestation (WG) presented to the emergency department complaining of lack of ability to walk and severe weakness of the lower limbs. She had no history of symptoms similar to GS, and there was no family history of neuromuscular diseases. She previously had been in excellent health apart from mild hyperemesis gravidarum, which resolved spontaneously at approximately 10 WG without medication. She had no diarrhea and denied taking herbal medicine, diuretics, laxatives, or glucocorticoids prior to her illness.
The patient was in her usual state of health when 5 days back she noticed progressive fatigue and bilateral muscle cramping predominating in lower extremities. The patient noticed knee buckling with frequent falls. Rapidly, within that span, the muscle weakness worsened, and she was confined to bed and unable to mobilize her legs, when she decided to consult in the hospital.
Her vital signs on examination were heart rate 130/min, blood pressure 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air, and temperature 37°C. The patient's review of systems was found negative for shortness of breath, cough, and swallowing difficulties. On neurological examination, the patient was alert and well-oriented. Her motor strength in upper limbs was 4/5. Hip flexors, quadriceps, and hamstrings were 1/5 bilaterally; dorsiflexors and plantar flexors were 0/5 bilaterally. Her cranial nerve examination was intact, and the sensation was diminished to touch and pinprick on lower extremities. Cranial and neck muscles were normal, but examination revealed deep tendon reflex to be absent on knees and ankles. The examination of other systems was unremarkable.
Table shows the initial laboratory data of the patient. Serum level of potassium was 2.2 mmol/L, serum magnesium 0.57 mmol/L, creatinine 68 μmol/L, and urea 2.8 mmol/L. Serum levels of sodium, total calcium, glucose, cortisol, thyroid, and liver function tests were found to be in normal range. Other blood investigations showed the following: hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL, white cell count 7.5 × 103/μL with a neutrophil count 5.9 × 103/μL, and C-reactive protein 5 mg/dL. Serum creatine phosphokinase level was 55 UI/L.
Her electrocardiogram (EKG) exhibited sinus tachycardia with inversion of T wave in leads D III, V1 to V4 suggesting hypokalemia.
She was assessed by a neurologist, and a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS) was suspected. Her time nerve conduction studies (Table ) revealed increased distal motor and sensitive latencies and reduced conduction velocities predominating in low members suggestive of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, in keeping with GBS. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed normal white cell count, protein, and glucose levels. The infectious and autoimmune screen was nonrevealing, and a fetal ultrasound scan showed an ongoing pregnancy at the age of 16 weeks and 6 days.
She was then shifted to ICU, and the next day, a course of IV immunoglobulins (0.4 g/kg per day for 5 days) was started, but this therapy resulted in a very poor effect. She was also given a continuous potassium supplementation in form of potassium chloride infusion (130 mmol/day) and intravenous magnesium chloride (40 mmol/day) under cardiac monitoring. Her muscle weakness worsened over 5 days of the treatment and spread to the upper limbs, trunk, and neck muscles. There was no associated difficulty in breathing or swallowing at this time. Serial biochemical evaluations during her hospital stay revealed persistent hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia despite parenteral supplements (Fig. ). This was further investigated by urine analysis, which showed the potassium to be 51.5 mmol/L (normal range 16–83), chloride: 91 mmol/L (normal range 73–167), calcium: 29 mg/L (normal range 66–200 mg/L), and creatinine: 11.5 mmol/L (normal range 3.5–23). Arterial blood gas analysis was performed with the patient breathing room air, which showed metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.48, HCO3 37.3, PaCO2 43.5). She also had increased plasma renin activity (2.6 ng/mL/h; normal range 0.12–1.59) and serum plasma aldosterone (720 ng/dL; normal range 80–365). Under the presenting circumstances, a tubulopathy causing renal potassium loss was considered. Based on the findings of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis without hypertension, severe hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria, a diagnosis of GS was suspected. This diagnosis was ascertained with the sequencing of the implicated gene, which confirmed GS as a heterozygous mutation in SLC12A3.
It was decided to reinforce ion supplementation, so potassium and magnesium supplements were increased to respectively 195 and 60 mmol/day.
On day 7 of her hospitalization, her condition deteriorated, and her tidal volume and minute volume decreased with swallowing difficulty. Oxygen saturation was 90% at 10 L/min delivered via a mask. To prevent hypoxemia and avoid emergency intubation, she was intubated and ventilated on controlled mandatory ventilation mode, and her vital parameters (electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature) were monitored. At this point, hypokalemia of 1.9 mmol/L was evident along with magnesium 0.43 mmol/L. Periodic fetal evaluation documented fetal well-being and normal size fetus with normal liquor and Doppler.
On day 8, the hemodynamic status worsened and the patient experienced prolonged hypotension and intermittent episodes of bradycardia, which occurred spontaneously, without relation to vagal maneuvers, such as endotracheal suctioning. She required vigorous volume replacement with normal saline and the use of vasopressor (Norepinephrine infusion) to maintain her mean arterial blood pressure up to 65 mmHg. EKG examination showed sinus bradycardia with the rate of 45 and prolonged QT interval. Echocardiographic and Doppler assessment failed to reveal any abnormalities in myocardial morphology or function.
On day 9, spontaneously fetal demise was observed, and the patient developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). She underwent electrical cardioversion (200 J biphasic), which restored sinus rhythm. Serum level of potassium was 1.5 mmol/L, and serum magnesium was 0.4 mmol/L. In view of the recent clinical deterioration, the use of a potassium-sparing diuretic or aldosterone antagonist was discussed, but this approach could result in hypovolemia and possibly worsen the hemodynamic status. Spironolactone was finally administered to this patient (100 mg/day). Subsequently, she continued to present repeated VF on the same day, which was complicated by a refractory cardiac arrest despite advanced cardiac life support.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [50.0, 'kg'], 'height': [160.0, 'cm']}",51.429,48.858,54.0,"The patient's gender is Female.

After placement of regular monitors, anesthesia was inducted with thiamylal, fentanyl and atracurium, and the patient was then intubated with 5.0 mm uncuffed endotracheal tube. A 5 Fr Uniblocker tube (Fuji Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted under the guide of a 2.0 mm-out diameter (OD) fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY) in the lumen of endotracheal tube. (Fig. ) The position of Uniblocker was checked by the bronchoscope to make sure the upper marker of the balloon was 1 to 2 mm just beneath the carina. (Fig. ) The balloon was gradually inflated with air until the breathing sound disappeared over left lung field. Two episodes of balloon dislodgement occurred before the surgical procedure per se, the first when changing position to the left decubitus position, and the second when inserting the surgical instrument into the port, presenting as oxygen desaturation and loss of corresponding lung collapse, respectively. In both episodes the position of Uniblocker was examined by bronchoscope and was adjusted inwards to the proper position. Then the surgical lung remained well collapsed all the time through resection of the left lower lobe, around 4 hours long. The ventilator was set at volume control mode with FiO2 100%, tidal volume 8 ml/kg, I.E. ratio 1:1.5, and respiratory rate 24 /min. End-Tidal CO2 was around 28 to 38 mmHg, and SpO2 was always above 97% during the rest course of one lung ventilation. At the timepoint when the surgeon stapled the bronchus, the bronchial balloon was deflated and the Uniblocker withdrawn into the tracheal tube to avoid incorporation with the surgical staple line.[ The whole surgical procedure was then finished smoothly, and two-lung ventilation was resumed, with a total one lung- ventilation period of 245 minutes and blood loss of 20 ml without blood transfusion. The Uniblocker tube was removed immediately after he was sent to the intensive care unit. The entotracheal tube was removed by the patient himself one day later, but was reinserted hours later for O2 desaturation. After 10 days of ICU care, the endotracheal tube was successfully weaned. Though subglottic tracheal stenosis occurred at 17 days, deemed to be due to tracheal re-intubation, this problem was solved by laser coagulation surgery, and he was discharged home on day 19 Table .","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [9.0, 'kg']}",36.0,34.2,37.8,"The patient's weight is 9.0 kg.

Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 36.0 mL/hr."
1433,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-6195710-1,Extracted,"A 43-yr-old, 66 kg, 175 cm man was to undergo gastrectomy for a tumor in the stomach. He had no history of hypertension, myocardial infarction,or angina pectoris,but with a smoking history(10 packs year).His physical examination was normal. Preoperative resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (Fig. )and echocardiogram(UCG) were within normal limits. Laboratory data revealed no abnormalities.
No premedication was given. After the patient,s arrival in the operating room, intravenous access was established. Lead II and V5 of the ECG were monitored. Blood pressure (BP) was 128/70 mmHg and heart rate(HR) 75 beats/min. An ultrasound-guided subcostal TAP block was performed bilaterally []. Each hemi abdomen was injected with 20 ml 0.3% ropivacaine to give a dual block from T6-T9. TAP block was uneventful without heart rate and blood pressure variations. After 30 min, general anesthesia was induced, then it was maintained with sevoflurane inhalation, target controlled infusion (TCI) remifentanil and given sufentanil and cisatracurium intermittently. The patient was mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 ml and respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min to maintain PetCO2 at 35–40 mmHg under end-tidal CO2 monitoring. Arterial BP was continuously monitored via a left radial artery catheter.
Two hours after start of the operation, when the surgeons were dissecting para gastric lymph node, ST segment elevation in lead II was noted (Fig. ) and lead V5 showed no abnormalities. The change recovered abruptly without treatment 30 s later. When it happened, SpO2 was 100%, end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 1.3% and no obvious hemorrhage. Except for this, the patient,s course during 4 h of operation was uneventful: BP was about 100/70 mmHg, HR about 70 beats/min, body temperature about 36.5 °C and estimated blood loss was less than 300 ml. Four hours after start of the operation, the arterial BP was 88/55 mmHg and aramine 0.4 mg was given intravenously. The BP increased to 110/65 mmHg without HR change. Approximately 5 min later, the ECG showed premature ventricular contractions and a marked ST segment elevation again (Fig. ). Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were subsequently noticed with BP decreased to 32/14 mmHg, and electric defibrillation was initiated with repeated infusions of epinephrin. Within approximately 2 min, the ECG returned to sinus rhythm and BP gradually to normal. The patient remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of the operation. Following the operation, he was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) in our hospital. Serial ECGs and cardiac enzyme studies showed no abnormalities, thus ruling out myocardial infarction and CAS was diagnosed. The patient suffered no further cardiac attacks during his hospital stay. Consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case report.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [70.0, 'mm hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [128.0, 'mm hg']}",89.333,84.866,93.8,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

7611,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-2811305-1,Extracted,"A 24-yr-old woman was seen in the endocrinology clinic at Samsung Medical Center because of transient numbness and periodic paralysis. The patient reported that the symptoms started 10 yr ago. The patient experienced occasional, brief episodes of paralysis during exertion that resolved with rest. Mild numbness and tingling of the hands and feet were also present intermittently.
On examination, the patient appeared well. Her vital signs were normal; her height was 155 cm, and her weight was 44 kg. Neurologic examination was significant for positive Trousseau and Chvostek signs. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory tests revealed hypocalcemia (7.3 mg/dL; reference range 8.4-10.2), hyperphosphatemia (5.7 mg/dL: reference range 2.5-4.5), decreased 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ([1,25(OH)2D] 13.2 pg/mL: reference range 25.1-66.1), and decreased iPTH (4.9 pg/mL: reference range 10-65). 25-hydroxycholecalciferol ([25(OH)D] 20.2 ng/mL: reference range 11-70) and 24-hr urinary calcium excretion was normal as were bone densitometry, thyroid functions tests, and radiographs of the kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) and skull. The patient was treated with calcium carbonate and alfacalcidol with resolution of symptoms and dosages were adjusted to maintain a serum calcium level within the lower end of the normal reference range.
The older brother of the proband had a history of generalized seizures since he was 20-yr-old for which he was seen by a neurologist at an outside hospital. He also presented to Samsung Medical Center with his sister because of intractable seizure. Initial evaluation revealed a serum calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL (reference range 8.4-10.2), a serum phosphorus concentration of 6.1 mg/dL (reference range 2.5-4.5), and a serum magnesium concentration of 1.9 mg/dL (reference range 1.9-2.5). The serum concentration of iPTH level was 6.2 pg/mL (reference range 10-65). He was treated with an antiepileptic medication and calcium carbonate, but seizure activity persisted. He was taking calcium carbonate 3 g per day with antiepileptic drug. He was admitted to the neurology ward where he underwent EEG and brain imaging. The laboratory test on admission showed a serum calcium concentration of 7.1 mg/dL (reference range 8.4-10.2), a serum phosphorus concentration of 5.6 mg/dL (reference range 2.5-4.5), and a serum ionized calcium concentration of 0.92 mM/L (reference range 1.05-1.35). Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed non-physiologic calcifications in the basal ganglia, bilateral frontal lobes, and cerebellum. The EEG was normal. A dosage of calcium supplement was adjusted, and alfacalcidol was added. He reported subsequent absence of seizure activity during follow-up. During follow-up the calcium level increased up to 8.3 mg/dL (reference range 8.4-10.2) and the ionized calcium level increased up to 1.0 mM/L (reference range 1.05-1.35). After seizure activity subsided, he is followed-up by the physician near the home.
Although the parents of patients denied symptoms attributable to hypocalcemia, they agreed to evaluation. Laboratory examination of their father revealed hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and an inappropriately low PTH level. The results of laboratory test are shown on . The mother's laboratory work-up was normal. The remaining members of the family were not included in this study because of inaccessibility ().
After we obtained informed consent, the proband and her family members were examined to detect the CaSR mutations by direct sequencing analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using a Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Each of the 6 exons of the CaSR gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate intronic primer sets designed by the authors (). Cycle sequencing was performed with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on the ABI-3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Direct sequencing showed that all affected family members have a C to T transition at nucleotide 662 resulting in a Pro221Leu missense mutation in exon 3 of the CaSR gene ().",What is the patient's body surface area?

3315,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-6563334-1,Extracted,"A 79-year-old Caucasian male, with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation on warfarin and metoprolol, and coronary artery disease on atorvastatin with previous coronary artery bypass grafting and placement of a dual-function pacemaker/ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), was on a motor boat in a remote location. The patient’s boat went over a wake of a larger boat passing by. He bounced off his seat in a vertical direction and subsequently landed on his tailbone. After the high impact fall, he complained of both immediate lower back and diffuse abdominal pain but did not seek out urgent medical help.
Two days after the initial incident, he started to become pale and diaphoretic; additionally, his ICD delivered three shocks over a 30-min period. He presented via ambulance service to a local community hospital in hemorrhagic shock with a blood pressure of 63/22 and heart rate of 118 beats/min. A primary survey was pertinently positive for hemodynamic instability and diffuse abdominal and lower thoracic spine tenderness.
He was resuscitated with 1 L of normal saline leading to an improvement of his pressure to 106/88. Initial laboratory investigations included a hemoglobin of 95 g/L, lactate of 6.1 mmol/L, creatinine of 129, and a supratherapeutic INR of 8.8. An initial non-contrast CT abdomen and pelvis showed moderate hemoperitoneum with sentinel clot in the left upper quadrant and pericolic gutter, as well as the area adjacent to the posterior wall of the stomach. An additional finding of a severely comminuted, minimally displaced burst fracture of the T10 vertebral body was noted (). Further interventions included INR reversal with 3 mg of Vitamin K and 3000 units of prothrombin complex concentrate, and administration of 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 L of normal saline. Based on clinical severity, the patient was transferred to the trauma service at a tertiary-care Level 1 trauma center.
Primary survey revealed a protected airway, spontaneous and bilateral air entry, and hemodynamic stability with a blood pressure of 100/60 and a heart rate of 88 beats/min. His abdomen continued to be mildly distended and tender without peritoneal signs, however the patient reported it had improved since his original presentation to the local hospital. Repeat laboratory investigations revealed a stable hemoglobin of 94 g/L, and correction of his INR to 1.2. Given his stable condition, he underwent a CT RIPIT (Rapid Imaging Protocol in Trauma) [] and CT angiogram (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis. His imaging revealed pseudoaneurysms of the left gastric artery measuring up to 6 mm with another 9 mm rounded area of increased attenuation along the lesser curve of the stomach (, ). No extravasation was seen. Decision was made to monitor the patient closely with serial abdominal exams and repeat imaging in 72 h, or sooner if the patient exhibited any signs of deterioration.
Over the next 72 h, the patient’s vital signs and abdominal exams, improved and his hematological profile remained stable. Given the patient’s CHADS score of 2, it was decided to hold therapeutic anticoagulation until the patient’s bleeding risk decreased, however deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis was initiated. A repeat CTA was performed to follow the evolution of the two pseudoaneurysms. The imaging study revealed unchanged pseudoaneurysms but noted the distal aspect of the left gastric artery was attenuated in keeping with a focal dissection and intramural thrombus. Secondary to the dissection, the patient was started on 81 mg of aspirin daily. Over the next few days the patient continued to improve clinically, and was discharged home. The patient lived outside of the local area, and arrangements for close follow up were made.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [79, 'years'], 'creatinine': [129.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Male', 'Race': 'White'}",45.145,42.888,47.402,"The patient is 79 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 129.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Creatinine is 129.0 µmol. To convert 129.0 µmol of Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 129.0 µmol Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000129 mol Creatinine. To convert from mol Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000129 mol Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 129.0 µmol Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Creatinine/dL. 
The patient is not Black, so the race coefficient is defaulted to 1.0.
The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 1.5^(-1.154) * 79^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=45.145.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 45.145 mL/min/1.73m²."
304,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-4531180-1,Extracted,"An 81-year-old male with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, three myocardial infarctions, four coronary stents, and end-stage heart failure presented to an outside hospital in June 2013 for destination LVAD placement (HeartMate II, Thoratec). Prior to LVAD placement, he did not have hematuria. However, as an inpatient, he developed gross hematuria and ultimately underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Pathology revealed muscle-invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma (UC) with squamous differentiation. Metastatic workup included a CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as a bone scan, which were both unremarkable.
After discharge, the patient's bladder cancer management was referred to our tertiary center, which is also an advanced heart failure referral center with considerable LVAD experience. By July 2013, he had recovered well from his LVAD placement with improved energy and exercise tolerance along with decreased dyspnea. Following a discussion of the risks and benefits, the decision was made for surgical resection with ileal conduit diversion. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was considered but not pursued given the risks of thromboembolism and infection, preexisting renal insufficiency, and patient preference.
The patient was evaluated by anesthesia and cardiology preoperatively and cleared for surgery. He had previously been on aspirin 81 mg, but this was held for one week in preparation for surgery. The patient was bridged from warfarin to therapeutic enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily) for 5 days with the last dose being 24 hours prior to surgery. In August 2013, the patient was preadmitted before surgery. Per protocol, he was given antimicrobial prophylaxis, alvimopan, and heparin 5000 u subcutaneous on the morning of surgery. Preoperative hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dL, and INR was 1.3.
After intubation, bilateral transversus abdominis blocks were performed for adjunctive pain control. Radical cystoprostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and ileal conduit diversion were performed without complication. Intraoperatively, 3.6 L crystalloid, 250 mL 5% albumin, and 1 unit pRBC were administered. The patient had 265 mL of urine output and 600 mL of blood loss. A Jackson-Pratt drain and ureteral stents were left in place, and the patient was extubated. Total room time was 270 minutes, and time from incision to close was 133 minutes.
After surgery, the patient was admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CICU) and given subcutaneous heparin every 8 hours. Postoperative investigations noted initially stable cardiopulmonary status (chest X-ray shown in ). Complete blood counts were drawn every 8–12 hours, and INR was checked daily. On postoperative day (POD) 1, he was transferred out of the CICU on aspirin 81 mg daily but no further anticoagulation given an INR of 2.1. By POD3, the patient's hemoglobin had decreased from 9.7 g/dL immediately after surgery to 7.5 g/dL. He was given 1 u pRBC and furosemide, but the patient became hypoxic. He was transferred back to the CICU and a bumetanide drip was initiated. He received another unit of blood once stabilized, and his hemoglobin increased to 10.7 g/dL.
The patient's diet was advanced on POD7 after passing flatus. From POD9 to POD11, there was a slow downtrend in hemoglobin. On POD11, a CT demonstrated free fluid of mixed heterogeneity in the paracolic gutters and pelvis, consistent with organizing hematoma (). Over the next 72 hours, 4 units of pRBC and 4 units of FFP were given for anemia and an INR of 3.8. Afterwards, the patient required no further transfusions, suggesting a self-resolving bleed. He also underwent left thoracentesis for a pleural effusion with 1.8 L of straw-colored transudate removed. Despite maintained hemodynamics, the remainder of his hospitalization was prolonged due to pain (located near the surgical incision) and anticoagulation monitoring. The acute pain service was consulted on POD15 and assisted with inpatient pain management and the transition to a home analgesia regimen. Warfarin was initiated on POD13 at an INR of 1.5. On POD20, he was discharged with an INR of 2.0 and hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, stable over 6 days. Final pathology revealed T2aN0 high-grade UC with squamous differentiation, 26 negative nodes, and negative margins.
The patient's last follow-up was 18 months after cystectomy. Surveillance imaging showed no signs of recurrence. The patient continues to do well from a urologic and cardiac standpoint, including stable renal function (creatinine 1.4 mg/dL), satisfactory ostomy care, and appropriate activity tolerance.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [81, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.4, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",50.495,47.97,53.02,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 81 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.4/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**81 * 1.0 = 50.495.

9402,64,Delta Ratio,lab test,decimal,pmc-4996607-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old female presented to her primary care physician with hematuria, right flank pain, and suprapubic cramping. She underwent a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a large right renal calculus and two smaller left renal calculi. She was subsequently referred to our office.
Her past medical history included hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation, rectocele, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Her surgical history included open cholecystectomy, two cesarean sections, and right-sided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy treatment in 1996. Neither stone analysis nor metabolic evaluation was available. Her family history is noncontributory in regard to nephrolithiasis. Her medications included metoprolol, aspirin, and sotalol. Her only allergy was to morphine.
Physical examination revealed a Caucasian female with a BMI of 47 kg/m2. She had a heart rate of 52, blood pressure of 160/75, and was afebrile. Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nondistended, nontender protuberant abdomen with a well-healed Pfannenstiel incision. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.
Urine analysis revealed a pH of 6, four white blood cells/high powered field, 73 red blood cells/high powered field, and no bacteria. Her urine culture showed growth of less than 10,000 CFU of alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus and diphtheroids. She was treated with ciprofloxacin for 7 days and tamsulosin for 2 days preoperatively before her procedure.
Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count 7400 cells/mcL, hemoglobin 13 g/dL, hematocrit 39%, and platelets 202,000 cells/mcL. Her sodium was 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, chloride 107 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 27 mmol/L, blood urea nitrate 16 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.7 mg/dL. Her calcium was 9.0 mg/dL and uric acid 5.0 mg/dL.
The initial CT scan revealed a right staghorn stone measuring 5.6 × 5.9 × 4.2 cm with low Hounsfield units (356–572). Her skin to stone distance ranged from 16 to 17 cm using axial images at 0°, 45°, and 90°. The stone filled the middle and lower calices, as well as the right renal pelvis, resulting in moderate hydronephrosis. Her left kidney contained two stones as follows: an 8 mm stone in the renal pelvis and a 2 mm upper pole stone. She also had a left peripelvic cyst measuring 7.8 × 8.1 × 8.3 cm, which was nonobstructing ().
A right percutaneous nephrolithotomy through access of the right upper pole was planned; the proposed supracostal nephrostomy tract would be 16.3 cm (measured on sagittal films). With the patient prone on spreader bars, a 14/16F 55 cm ureteral access sheath was advanced retrograde over the initial guidewire. Under combined fluoroscopic and ureteroscopic control, a supra-11th rib access was obtained with a single pass of the nephrostomy needle. Using the holmium laser through the rigid nephroscope complemented by flexible ureteroscopy and flexible nephroscopy, the staghorn stone was cleared. At the end of the procedure, Surgiflo was used to seal the nephrostomy access using a 7F occlusion balloon catheter that was inflated at the junction of the collecting system and renal parenchyma. This positioning was confirmed before injection of Surgiflo using nephroscopy and fluoroscopy and left in place for 10 minutes. Finally, an indwelling 6F ureteral stent was placed. Overall, operative time was 4 hours with no intraoperative complications and estimated blood loss of less than 100 cc. A postoperative chest X-ray in the recovery room revealed no effusion and no pneumothorax (). She was discharged to home on postoperative day 1.
The patient returned to our office 1 week later for stent removal. At that time, she was doing well and only complaining of mild right-sided discomfort felt to be related to her stent. Her laboratory investigations at that time revealed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen of 19 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes were normal. Her hemoglobin and white blood count remained unchanged compared with preoperative values. Stone analysis revealed 20% calcium oxalate monohydrate and 80% uric acid. Her stone culture demonstrated low counts of mixed flora, including mixed gram-negative rods, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus viridans. She underwent an uneventful stent removal in the office and was discharged to home.
One day after stent removal, she returned to the emergency department complaining of severe right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased urine output. In the interim, she also noted new onset left-sided pain. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen of 25 mg/dL. Her blood glucose was 169 mg/dL. Compared with preoperative levels, her hemoglobin was slightly decreased at 10.3 g/dL with a hematocrit of 31% and platelets of 151,000 cells/mcL. A urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.0 with 153 white blood cells and 182 red blood cells/HPF and no bacteria. Her urine culture was negative.
Upon admission, a CT scan was performed that showed a large right-sided pleural effusion and migration of her left renal pelvis stone into the proximal ureter. Due to her anatomy and the large left peripelvic cyst, the migration of the stone into the proximal ureter was only apparent on careful review of the sagittal views of the CT scan ().
With urine output of about 50 mL over 8 hours and her creatinine rising to 3.0 mg/dL, interventional radiology placed an 8F catheter to drain the right pleural effusion; 2 L of straw-colored fluid was drained immediately. Bilateral nephrostomy tubes were also placed by to relieve her obstruction and pain. The effusion had an elevated creatinine of 8.0 mg/dL. After the placement of the chest tube and the nephrostomy tubes, the patient showed marked improvement, with return of her creatinine to baseline over the next 3 days. Her chest tube was removed on the 3rd day and both nephrostomy tubes were left open to drainage. Interestingly, she continued to complain of intermittent left flank discomfort, although the left nephrostomy tube continued to drain well. She was discharged home on day 6. Two weeks later, the patient returned to the operating room for treatment of her left proximal stone. Interestingly, the coil of the left nephrostomy tube was limited within the peripelvic cyst with only a small opening communicating with the collecting system. This was incised at this procedure, and her left nephrostomy tube was maintained due to patient preference; no ureteral stent was placed on the left side. The right nephrostomy tube was removed after prompt excretion from her right collecting system.
The patient returned to our office 1 week later for routine postprocedural follow-up and a left nephrostogram. The nephrostogram showed prompt flow of contrast to the bladder; the left nephrostomy tube was removed. Her urine culture was negative. Subsequently, a full metabolic evaluation was completed, which showed low urine volume, hypercalciuria, and natriuria. She was placed on a low purine, low sodium diet, and advised to increase her fluid intake to 3–4 L/day.",What is the patient's delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [107.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [27.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [140.0, 'mmol/L']}",2.0,1.9,2.1,"The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 107.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 107.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 107.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 107.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 107.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 107.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 27.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 27.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 27.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 27.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 27.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 27.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (107.0 mEq/L + 27.0 mEq/L) = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 6.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 6.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 6.0 - 12 = -6.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -6.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -6.0 mEq/L / -3.0 mEq/L = 2.0. The patient's delta ratio is 2.0."

He was arousable on scene and was transported by the Emergency Medical Services to a local Emergency Department, where he remained awake and alert. He admitted to huffing the Dust-Off, as well as a history of recurrent and heavy hydrocarbon huffing. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and revealed sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc of 472 milliseconds (). The patient was transferred to a regional burn unit for frostbite on his hand due to refrigerant exposure.
While in the burn unit, the patient had a generalized seizure and went into cardiac arrest. Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol was initiated. The patient was found to be in a torsades de pointes rhythm () and was given magnesium. He was intubated, resuscitated, and sent to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was placed on fentanyl and midazolam drips and continuously monitored. Episodes of hypotension and tachycardia were noted, as well as right bundle branch block on repeat ECG. He was started on multiple vasopressors and given amiodarone for dysrhythmias. Hypocalcemia (5.6 mg/dL) was treated with calcium gluconate boluses and resolved.
Pertinent medical history included multiple psychiatric admissions and tobacco and prior alcohol abuse. The patient was homeless and unemployed. Possible outpatient medications included multiple antidepressants and sedatives, but compliance was unknown.
At the time of toxicology consultation approximately 24 hours after presentation, physical exam revealed a young white male, intubated, arousable but easily agitated. Vital signs included a heart rate of 106, blood pressure of 110/67, respiratory rate of 14 per minute, and 100% oxygen saturation on the ventilator. Maximum temperature was noted to be 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit, with a temperature of 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit at consultation. His pupils were 3 mm and reactive to light. He was tachycardic with a regular rhythm. The remainder of the exam was benign with no appreciable neurological deficits, rigidity, or clonus.
Initial chemistry panel revealed creatinine of 1.55 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, magnesium of 3.0 mg/dL, and an anion gap of 19. AST was mildly elevated at 64 U/L with an ALT of 48 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 37 mmHg, pO2 of 80 mmHg, HCO3 of 22 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation at 94% prior to intubation. Over the next 24 hours, the patient was noted to have elevated lactate of 4.7 mmol/L and evidence of rhabdomyolysis (maximum CK 5058 U/L, day 2), shock liver (maximum AST 17432 U/L, day 3), acute kidney injury (maximum creatinine 1.86 mg/dL, day 2), troponin elevation (maximum 20.20 ng/mL, day 2), and coagulopathy (maximum INR 3.0, day 2).
Echocardiogram revealed left and right ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25% and global hypokinesis. Multiple chest X-rays were negative for an acute cardiopulmonary process. Labs drawn prior to discharge revealed resolving transaminitis and rhabdomyolysis, as well as normalized renal function and INR.
The patient was discharged eight days after admission with a repeat echocardiogram showing normal left ventricle size and function, normal wall motion, and an ejection fraction of 55%. He confirmed that he had only used Dust-Off on the day of presentation.",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [103.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [16.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [138.0, 'mmol/L']}",7.0,6.65,7.35,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 103.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 103.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 103.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 103.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 103.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 19.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 19.0 - 12 = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 7.0 mEq/L."

Otherwise, he had no history of foreign travel and familial problems. This time, he visited our emergency room due to high fever and chills for a day. Abdominal fullness, anorexia, and weight loss had also developed for 3 months before this visit. The physical examinations revealed a tachycardia of 114 beats per minute, fever of 38.4°C, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. The blood sampling showed leukocytosis, azotemia, and increased serum procalcitonin level (Table ). The urine analysis revealed the pyuria, suggesting the complicated urinary tract infection. The abdominal plain film showed mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic changes: cortical thickening, sclerosis with coarsened trabeculae, and flame-shaped lucent lesion in the pelvic bone with right site predominantly (Fig. ).
Considering the image results and other clinical symptoms such as anorexia and weight loss, the differential diagnosed of the bone lesion is crucial for the patient. The blood chemistry results on the second day, showed only mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and inorganic phosphorus, while highly elevated parathyroid hormone but decreased corrected calcium was noted, favor secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal function insufficiency (Table ). On the third day after admission, we check the serum tumor markers of leading causes for bone metastasis in the male patients, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and squamous cell carcinoma antigen for lung cancer and prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer, and all of 3 markers showed normal or mild elevation (Table ). Monoclonal globulin elevation was not identified in serum screening as well (Table ).
Otherwise the abdominal plain film, the skull X-ray plain film was performed on the second day after admission and demonstrated no osteolytic lesions (Fig. ). We arranged gallium-67 tumor scan and Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan on the third day and disclosed no lesions throughout the entire body except for the pelvic bones (Fig. ).
The patient was diagnosed as asymptomatic PDB based on the pelvic X-ray and elevated ALP level without extended high-risk bone involvement on bone scan, and complicated urinary tract infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He received intravenous hydration and piperacillin 4 g and tazobactam 0.5 g injection every 12 hours, which led to the clinical improvement of his urinary tract infection after 7 days treatment. We shifted to ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally once per day for another week and discharged the patient.

The patient's heart rate is 114.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 0 + 1.5 = 1.5.
Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 1.5.
Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 1.5.

107,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-7588675-1,Extracted,"The patient was an 18-year-old man who had been complaining of exertional cough and dyspnea for 4 months. He had no medical and familial history. He graduated from junior high school but did not go to high school or work. He presented to our hospital after visiting a general practitioner for epigastric discomfort and nausea. At that time, urinalysis revealed massive proteinuria. On the next day, he was referred and admitted to our hospital for a thorough examination. He had no history of hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, drug abuse, ureteral reflux, premature birth, or any other diseases.
On admission, physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.7°C, a body weight of 62 kg, and a height of 168 cm. Blood pressure was 157/85 mm Hg. There were evident leg edema, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, and no skin lesions. The laboratory findings revealed decreased serum total protein (5.9 g/dL) and albumin (2.6 g/dL); normal serum creatinine (SCr, 0.9 mg/dL) and eGFR (95 mL/min/1.73 m2); elevated LDL cholesterol (224 mg/dL); and slightly elevated serum calcium (10.6 mg/dL). BNP level was remarkably elevated (1,850 pg/mL). Urinalysis revealed a subnephrotic level of urinary protein (3.0 g/day), microhematuria (5–9/HPF), no leukocyturia, and no bacteria. The soluble interleukin 2 receptor level was elevated (2,905 U/mL); serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was normal (14.2 U/L); renin activity was remarkably elevated (39 ng/mL/h); plasma aldosterone level was within normal limits (184 pg/mL). The urinary N-acetyl-glucosaminidase level was remarkably elevated (85.6 IU/L). Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen and antibody were all negative. Immunoglobulins, complements, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all negative. Tuberculin test was negative.
The chest X-ray showed enhanced pulmonary congestion and no detectable hilar lymphadenopathy. In contrast, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed hilar lymphadenopathy without fibrosis in any lung field. Furthermore, abdominal CT revealed bilateral normal-sized kidneys and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Gallium-67 scintigraphy revealed uptakes in the pulmonary hilum, mediastinum, bilateral submaxillary glands, bilateral parotid glands, and bilateral inguinal regions. Echocardiography detected severe cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction 25%), diffuse akinesis of the ventricular wall, and atrial septal defect, but it did not detect thinning of the interventricular septum base. However, electrocardiogram-gated cardiac CT revealed thinning of the interventricular septum base, and this finding was supported by a cine magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac dysfunction and thinning of the ventricular septum base were supportive findings of cardiac sarcoidosis.
On the first admission, the patient received treatment for heart failure and hypertension, including temocapril hydrochloride, calcium channel antagonist, carvedilol, spironolactone, and carperitide. Thereafter, the urinary protein level decreased to <1 g/day, and the heart failure and hypertension improved. On the 30th hospital day, the patient was discharged. The inguinal biopsy that was performed as outpatient procedure detected granulomas; therefore, the diagnosis was sarcoidosis. On the 69th day, the SCr level gradually increased to 2.00 mg/dL (eGFR 39.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio increased to 3.2 g/gCr. At this time, the serum albumin and LDL cholesterol levels were 3.7 g/dL and 134 mg/dL, respectively. Therefore, he was readmitted for renal investigation.
Subsequent renal biopsy revealed the presence of 32 glomeruli, 8 of which showed global sclerosis. Mesangial proliferation, crescent formation, or epithelial change was not observed. In 4 glomeruli, segmental sclerotic lesions were found near the vascular pole and were classified as the perihilar variant of FSGS [] (Fig. ). The diameter of the Bowman's space of the FSGS lesions was maintained at approximately 200–230 μm. Conversely, several ischemic glomerular changes were found, including atrophic Bowman's capsule, glomerular tuft shrinking, and global sclerosis (Fig. ). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration accounted for 70% of the renal parenchyma. Mononuclear cell infiltration, giant cells, and noncaseous granulomas in the tubulointerstitium were noted. The majority of the granulomas involved small arteries and/or arterioles, many of which had intimal wall thickness, reduplicated internal elastic lamina, and narrow lumen (Fig. ). Many of the epithelioid cells of these granulomas were arranged concentrically around the artery/arteriole and formed a multilayer structure.
Immunostaining by an enzyme-labeled antibody method revealed focal and segmental deposits of IgM (1+) in the glomerular lesions. In the tubulointerstitium, no significant deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, and C3 were found. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68-positive macrophage accumulation in the tubulointerstitial granulomas but not in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy did not detect any glomeruli. Based on these findings, the pathological diagnosis was tubulointerstitial granulomatous angiocentric vasculitis with FSGS.
He received oral prednisolone 30 mg/day after the renal biopsy revealed renal sarcoidosis. At 27 days after the initiation of steroid therapy, the SCr level decreased to 1.60 mg/dL (eGFR 50.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), with a simultaneous decrease in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio to <0.5 g/gCr. Thereafter, oral prednisolone was tapered to 25 mg/day, and the patient was discharged on the 38th day of the second hospital stay (the 108th day).
After discharge, his blood pressure stabilized. Later in the clinical course, nifedipine could be reduced, and temocapril was discontinued. Echocardiography showed recovery of cardiac function (ejection fraction 55.4%). Oral prednisolone was gradually tapered to 2 mg/day after 8 years of steroid initiation, and the SCr level decreased to 1.22 mg/dL (eGFR 60.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) after 8.8 years of the initial presentation. The urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio was maintained at <0.3 g/gCr. No other immunosuppressants were used. No relapse in the clinical course has occurred at the time of writing this manuscript.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [62.0, 'kg'], 'height': [168.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.9, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [18, 'years']}",116.728,110.892,122.564,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 18 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 62.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 62.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 21.967 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.0, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 62.0 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 18) * 62.0 * 1) / (0.9 * 72) = 116.728 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 116.728 mL/min."

The containers and pipes used for production, use, storage, and transportation of monochloroacetic acid in the factory are made of corrosion-resistant materials. However, they had not been inspected and maintained for a long time. On 17 October 2019, at 10 am, a glass tube ruptured as 80 % monochloroacetic acid, heated to 60 °C, was being delivered under pressure. The liquid sprayed the patient’s chest, left armpit, and right wrist. Although he immediately took off the clothes, redness, swelling, and the sensation of burning appeared in the affected area of the skin. The patient rinsed the acid off with water for 15 min and dried the skin with a towel. He then reported the accident and waited for assistance at his workplace. He complained of monochloroacetic acid mist and smell in the workshop and inhaled some of the vapours of the acid. Shortly thereafter, pain appeared in the area that previously was in contact with monochloroacetic acid, and dyspnoea and irritating dry cough developed. The patient was rushed to the local hospital in an ambulance, and during the ride, the skin was washed with a 4 % solution of sodium bicarbonate. Despite this treatment, the skin continued to show redness, ulceration, and blisters, and some areas turned dark brown. He arrived at the hospital approximately 2.5 h after the accident, and emergency debridement of necrotic areas was performed immediately. Shortly after, the patient developed lethargy, dyspnoea, and hypoxemia and was transferred to the Qilu Hospital for treatment the following day (18 October 2019). Upon admission, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP) 152/104 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 90 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 13 breaths/min, body temperature 37 °C, and oxygen saturation 95 % (with oxygen treatment at the rate of 5 L/min). The patient was conscious, lethargic, and developed dry heaving and blurred vision. Crepitations were audible over the lung base bilaterally. Heart rhythm was normal, the abdomen was flat and soft, and no abnormality was apparent. shows the laboratory findings on admission to the Qilu Hospital.
After administration of anti-tetanus immunoglobulin, the wound () was treated again by repeated rinsing with iodophor and saline and covering with antibacterial dressing. An intravenous infusion was initiated to maintain water-electrolyte balance and provide antibiotic treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam and moxifloxacin. The patient also received daily intravenous infusions of 200 mg methylprednisolone as pulse therapy. Considering the large area of the burn and the long time during which monochloroacetic acid was absorbed, bedside continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) was applied every other day to rapidly remove acid from the circulation and prevent acute renal failure. Patient’s lethargy gradually improved, and the level of consciousness returned to normal on the third day of treatment. The wound dressing was changed daily, and the patient did not have severe acidosis, oliguria, or anuria. However, he developed a cough with purulent yellow sputum and his temperature rose to 38.8 °C but dropped to normal after the administration of antibiotics. Six days after the admission (on 24 October), the patient’s condition was relatively stable, and laboratory tests improved (). Wheezing, coughing, and expectoration continued, however. shows the head, abdomen, and chest scan () revealed cerebellar infarction, a few ischemic degeneration foci in the brain, a few inflammation areas in both lungs, fibrous foci, a small amount of effusion in bilateral pleural cavity, and adjacent pulmonary tissue swelling, indicating monochloroacetic acid aspiration pneumonia.

The patient remained stable until 5 November (see blood test findings in ). Methylprednisolone was discontinued and replaced with oral prednisone, which was gradually reduced. Given the stable condition of the patient, the burn department was contacted to arrange skin grafting. The patient was diagnosed with a 10 % third-degree burn. On 18 November, he underwent debridement and negative pressure suction of the upper limbs and left chest wall under general anaesthesia. Granulation and stale tissue on the wound surface were removed. Skin grafting was performed under general anaesthesia by rinsing the wound with hydrogen peroxide and sterile saline, and implanting the patient’s left anterior thigh full-thickness flap into the left upper limb and the left side of the chest wall.

1319,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-6967041-1,Extracted,"A 59-year-old man (170 cm, 78 kg) had cerebral infarction of the right precentral gyrus 2 years prior presentation and was diagnosed with bilateral ICA stenosis. He was treated conservatively (oral cilostazol and clopidogrel) and followed up; however, the stenosis of the left ICA progressed. Therefore, he was scheduled for CEA. There were no apparent complications related to his previous cerebral infarction. He was receiving an oral treatment for hypertension and dyslipidemia and had a long history of smoking (40 cigarettes per day for 40 years). There were no other notable findings in preoperative examinations. On the day of surgery, he was admitted to the operating room without premedication. Pre-oxygenation was performed using a mask without headband. Anesthesia was induced using 200 μg fentanyl and 5 mg midazolam, and 60 mg rocuronium was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. A Macintosh laryngoscope was used to expose the larynx. The view was classified as Cormack III. We attempted a tracheal intubation with a endotracheal tube (Shiley™ Endotracheal Tube with TaperGuard™ Cuff 7.5 mm), but the esophagus was inadvertently intubated, so it was removed. The second tracheal intubation by using a Macintosh laryngoscope was successful. Wheals appeared on the upper limbs, neck, and precordium without any vital sign changes after infusion of cefazolin sodium as a preoperative antibiotic, so administration was discontinued. The skin signs were believed to be an allergic reaction to cefazolin, which was changed to fosfomycin, and the patient also received an intravenous infusion containing 200 mg of hydrocortisone sodium phosphate. During surgery, he was placed in the supine position, but the neck was slightly rotated and lateroflexed to the right to secure the surgical field. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.4% sevoflurane and remifentanil at a dose of 0.2 μg/kg/min. Mild hypotension was observed intraoperatively. This was managed with fluid infusions and continuous administration of an appropriate dose of noradrenaline. Surgery was concluded without problems, and the preoperatively observed wheals resolved. Endotracheal aspiration was performed after waking up the patient, but it triggered a strong cough reflex. The patient was then extubated. The duration of surgery was 4 h and 57 min, the duration of anesthesia was 6 h and 29 min, the volume of blood loss was negligible, the in-out balance was + 3210 mL (crystalloid fluid 4175 mL, urine volume 965 mL), and mild swelling of the face and both upper limbs was noted. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a lucid state with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 110 beats/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 3 L of nasal oxygen and respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min. His arterial blood gas analysis was normal, and mild hoarseness was noted without swelling of the neck or stridor. Six hours after admission to the ICU mild bilateral neck swelling appeared. The hoarseness rapidly worsened, and tachypnea and stridor appeared 1 h later without oxygen desaturation. Emergency intubation with a tube (Shiley™ Evac Endotracheal Tube with TaperGuard™ Cuff 7.5 mm) was immediately performed with mild sedation with propofol under spontaneous breathing on suspicion of upper airway obstruction. We used a video laryngoscope (HOYA Co. Ltd., airway scope) with a gum elastic bougie tube introducer. Laryngopharyngeal findings at this time included no epiglottic edema. However, the edema of the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls was present, and it narrowed the oral and pharyngeal cavities. The neck swelling was pronounced, and the neck circumference was 63 cm (Fig. ). A CT scan was performed to investigate the cause and to facilitate differential diagnosis of possible postoperative hemorrhage, but no bleeding was observed. The bilateral parotid and salivary glands were markedly swollen (Fig. ), and the edema of the posterior pharyngeal wall was developed (Fig. ) when compared to the preoperative state. Blood test results revealed a leukocyte count of 8000/μL (eosinophils 0%), amylase at 1790 U/L, mumps immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 16.6 (+), mumps IgM at 0.27 (−), and C-reactive protein at 0.18. Based on these findings, we concluded that the patient had previously suffered from a mumps infection, but had no active disease. Moreover, he only presented with the clinical features of sialadenitis. We commenced administration of steroids to reduce the edema. On postoperative day (POD) 2, the serum amylase decreased to 457 U/L, gradual improvement of the bilateral parotid gland swelling was observed, and the patient was extubated. The subsequent clinical course was favorable, and the neck swelling disappeared. The general condition, airways, and ability to swallow were all normal when the patient was discharged on POD 11.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [120.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [70.0, 'mm hg']}",86.667,82.334,91.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

3705,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7676804-1,Extracted,"A 40-year-old male was brought by a friend to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation with a chief complaint of headache. The patient reported a headache that was diffuse, severe in intensity, throbbing in nature, and gradual in onset. The headache started when he lay down to sleep that evening. It was associated with nausea and numbness and tingling in his bilateral hands and feet. The headache was preceded by several hours of fatigue and generalized weakness. The patient drank six 12-ounce beers before going to bed. The friend at the bedside explained that he typically drank that amount, and expressed concern because the patient seemed much more intoxicated than he typically would be after drinking that amount.
The patient had a past medical history of depression and anxiety. He had a surgical history of an open reduction and internal fixation of a right calcaneal fracture 10 years prior. He took sertraline 100 milligrams (mg) daily, and had no drug allergies. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day and was a daily drinker, but had not experienced alcohol withdrawal. He denied use of illicit drugs. Family history was notable for a cerebrovascular accident and myocardial infarction in his parents, and vertigo in a sibling. He worked as a contractor for a gas and electric company, and spent most of his day outside. He had no recent travel history. A review of systems revealed a one-week history of right ankle pain, swelling, and redness that the patient attributed to a “spider bite.”
The patient was alert, oriented, and uncomfortable but non-toxic appearing on the initial exam. His temperature was 36.8° Celsius (C), with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 139/83 millimeters (mm) of mercury, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. He weighed 82.6 kilograms (kg), was 1.96 meters tall with a body mass index of 22.5 kg/m2. He appeared well developed and well nourished. His head was normocephalic and atraumatic. He had moist mucous membranes, without oral lesions, and with a normal oropharynx. Pupils were 2 mm, equal, and sluggishly reactive to light. His extraocular movements were normal. There was no scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. Visual acuity was grossly normal. The neck was supple without cervical lymphadenopathy, meningismus, or midline or paraspinal cervical spine tenderness. Heart was regular rate and rhythm, without murmur, rubs, or gallops. Breath sounds were clear bilaterally without wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdomen was soft and nontender, without rebound, guarding, or rigidity, and with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good distal pulses.
There was a small area of blanching erythema and ecchymosis in the right lateral malleolar region. There was no increased warmth, edema, other evidence of trauma, or painful or limited range of motion of the ankle. Neurologic exam showed cranial nerves II–XII intact, 4/5 strength throughout the bilateral upper extremities, 5/5 strength throughout the bilateral lower extremities, with normal tone, and normal sensation throughout. Speech was clear and fluent, and mood and affect were appropriate. Skin was warm and dry. A papular rash was noted on his lower extremities (). It did not involve the palms or soles.
The patient’s initial laboratory testing results are shown in . His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with normal axis, normal intervals, and no ST-segment elevation, depression, or T-wave inversions. Two hours after his initial evaluation, he began vomiting and complained of dysarthria, dysphagia, and vertigo. Tongue fasciculations were present. He received a dose of metoclopramide. Due to concern for an acute cerebral vascular accident, a computed tomography (CT) of the head, and a CT angiography of the head and neck were subsequently performed and showed no acute abnormality. Neurology was consulted, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain without contrast was obtained per their recommendation. The MRI was markedly limited by motion artifact and was of poor diagnostic quality. As described by radiology, the image showed foci of increased fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal involving portions of the cortex of the frontal lobes bilaterally, deep periventricular white matter, left side of midbrain, throughout the pons, and in the deep left cerebellar hemisphere.
The patient was reassessed when he returned from MRI. His BP and heart rate were relatively unchanged, but he was febrile (38.4°C). The patient had become somnolent and he was no longer managing his oral secretions. It was determined that he was no longer adequately protecting his airway. He was intubated without complication, blood cultures were drawn, and he was started on empiric broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained. The results are shown in . A diagnostic test was sent, which confirmed the diagnosis.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [1.96, 'm']}",89.48,85.006,93.954,"The patient's gender is Male.

Preoperative laboratory examination showed the following: PLTS, 109,000/µL; PT-ACT, 74%; PT-INR, 1.14; Fib, 203 mg/dL; D-dimer, 0.9 µg/mL; ALB, 3.8 mg/dL; T-Bil, 1.29 mg/dL; Cre, 0.9 mg/dL; eGFR, 65.1 mL/min/1.73 m2; CRP, 0.11 mg/dL; indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15), 45.7%; and a Child–Pugh A score of 6 points. Consequently, laparoscopic microwave coagulation therapy was planned for this patient. Since PVT and congestion of portal blood flow were observed in the left and 4th segment branch of the portal vein after microwave coagulation therapy by endoscopic ultrasonography during surgery, administration of antithrombin III concentrate with enoxaparin was administered for 5 days after surgery. Enhanced CT on POD 5 revealed a thrombosis in the segment 4th branch of the portal vein (Fig. ), and the patient was administered with 60 mg edoxaban as a result. Consciousness disorder occurred on POD 15, and CT examination revealed cerebellar hemorrhage with ventricular perforation (Fig. ). Blood examination at this time revealed the following: PLTS, 181,000/µL; PT-ACT, 52%; PT-INR, 1.39; Fib, 224 mg/dL; D-dimer, 5.6 µg/mL; ALB, 3.7 mg/dL; T-Bil, 1.23 mg/dL; Cre, 1.23 mg/dL; eGFR, 88.5 mL/min/1.73 m2. Although cerebellar hemorrhage was successfully treated by craniotomy hematoma evacuation with ventricular drainage, the consciousness disorder persisted.

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [67, 'years'], 'weight': [65.5, 'kg'], 'height': [173.6, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.9, 'mg/dL']}",73.789,70.1,77.478,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 67 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 173.6 cm, which is 173.6 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.736 m. The patient's weight is 65.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 65.5 kg / (1.736 m * 1.736 m) = 21.734 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 21.7, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 65.5 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 67) * 65.5 * 1) / (0.9 * 72) = 73.789 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 73.789 mL/min."
7536,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-5296625-1,Extracted,"A 42-year-old G2P1001 presented for a routine growth ultrasound at 36 wk 5 d. The fetus was found to have a vein of Galen malformation, which had not been identified during the 20-wk anatomy scan (Figure ). A review of her medical history was significant for a prior uncomplicated full-term vaginal delivery. Her living child is alive and well, meeting all appropriate milestones. The patient denied any significant family history for congenital anomalies or social history for toxic environmental or occupational exposures. Prenatal care was otherwise uneventful. Fetal MRI confirmed the diagnosis of VOGM, demonstrating a persistent median prosencephalic vein, which measured up to 22 mm in the transverse dimension and 74 mm in length (Figure and C). There was a network of feeding vessels (greater on the right as compared to the left) in the region of the medial temporal lobe, midbrain, and thalami, which likely represented feeder vessels emanating from the posterior cerebral arteries. Torcula and bilateral transverse sinuses were also enlarged. The lateral ventricles and cortical sulci were appropriate for the patient's gestational age. The infratentorial brain appeared normal, with no mass effect or midline shift.
A fetal echocardiogram showed cardiomegaly with preserved biventricular systolic function. The superior vena cava (SVC) was moderately dilated. The right atrium was severely dilated whereas the left atrium was only mildly dilated and there was an aneurysmal patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right to left shunting. The right ventricle (RV) was moderately dilated with qualitatively good RV systolic function. There was marked reversal of flow in the distal aortic arch, apparently draining predominantly to the brachiocephalic artery.
Over the next 2 d, repeat sonographic evaluation demonstrated new polyhydramnios and abnormal Doppler studies. The fetus developed an abnormal fetal heart rate tracing with areas of minimal variability and non-reactivity. At this point, because of the massive VOGM causing a steal phenomenon, evidence of heart failure, worsening doppler studies, and fetal monitoring showing fetal compromise, the decision was made to proceed with delivery and to achieve optimization of management in the neonate. An elective uncomplicated primary cesarean section was performed because of fetal cardiac failure and breech presentation. The neonate had Apgar scores of 4 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min. Cord blood gas studies showed a pH of 7.30 and base deficit of -2.2.
Physical examination revealed a weight of 2675 g (25th centile), length 47 cm (30th centile), head circumference 33 cm (40th centile). No visible anomalies were noted at birth. The pertinent physical findings were cranial bruit and a grade 2/6 soft systolic heart murmur at the left sternal border.
Chest radiography immediately after birth showed cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram performed at 1 h of life showed pulmonary hypertension, patent foramen ovale, dilated superior vena cava and reversal of flow in the descending aorta. Neurosonogram showed a large midline venous structure. MRI and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography showed VGOM and the vessels feeding the aneurysm (Figures and ). The feeding arteries are from bilateral middle cerebral arteries, bilateral anterior cerebral arteries and posterior cerebral arteries.
Over the first few days, the infant gradually became tachypneic and had a hyperdynamic precordium. Medical treatment of cardiac failure (furosemide, digoxin, and milrinone) was begun on the second day of life. Since the patient showed signs of cardiac decompensation despite the cardiac failure therapy, embolization with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was performed via the umbilical artery catheter at 7 d of age. The patient was intubated and placed on a conventional ventilator at 10 d of age. Trans-femoral embolizations were performed on the 10th, 12th and 14th day of life, and finally trans-axillary artery embolization was performed at 19 d of age. A repeat neurosonogram done on the 19th day of life showed intraventricular hemorrhage and mild post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, which however, did not require any intervention. The patient was extubated on the 20th day of life, MRI and MR angiography performed on the following day showed that the dilatation of the Vein of Galen had decreased markedly (Figure ). The infant was discharged at 53 d of age. When seen at 6 mo of age in the follow-up clinic, the patient was developing normally.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She was admitted to the hospital 12 days before because of an infected left foot ulcer that required debridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy. Six weeks prior to admission she was seen by a pain management specialist for swelling of the right elbow and she was diagnosed with olecranon bursitis. She was treated with bursa aspiration and corticosteroid injection. Cultures were reportedly negative. One to two weeks after the procedure, she had worsening of swelling, as well as pain and erythema of the olecranon bursa. She did not report fever, weight loss, fatigue, or weakness.
Her past medical history was remarkable for RA diagnosed at 30 years of age, arterial hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and asthma. Her surgical history included amputations of the first and second toes of the left foot and two tendon repairs (left hand and left shoulder). She received multiple therapies for RA including auranofin, methotrexate, leflunomide, and etanercept. Her last treatment was golimumab, which she used for 4 years. She did not have further follow-up with her rheumatologist and stopped this treatment about 2 years before onset of olecranon bursitis.
On initial evaluation, she had normal vital signs. Scleromalacia was noted bilaterally. Examination of the upper extremities showed ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints and swan neck deformities bilaterally. The left wrist had marked limitation of flexion and extension. The right olecranon bursa was tender and swollen, and the overlying skin was erythematous (). Range of motion of the right elbow was not limited. She had multiple subcutaneous nodules in the right leg and a stage IV ulcer on the medial aspect of the left foot. Generalized muscle atrophy was observed. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 6.8 × 103/μL, lymphocytic count of 1.2 × 103/μL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 344 × 103/μL. Serum creatinine was 0.5 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen was 17 mg/dL. Wound cultures were negative. Chest X-ray showed mild prominence of the pulmonary markings in the right infrahilar region.
The olecranon bursa was aspirated and 9 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was obtained. No crystals were observed under polarized microscopy. Fluid analysis showed a white blood cell count of 3.1 × 103/μL (41% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and 29% monocytes). Bacterial cultures were negative. Fungal culture was positive for Candida parapsilosis; this was sensitive to anidulafungin, micafungin, caspofungin, 5-flucytosine, voriconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole. The VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, Inc., Hazelwood, Missouri, USA) was used for fungus identification. The Sensititre YeastOne system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) was utilized to determine antifungal susceptibility.
She was treated with caspofungin 50 mg intravenously daily for 13 days. Four aspiration procedures were required (every 3–5 days) due to fluid reaccumulation. All samples were cultured but only the first two were positive for Candida parapsilosis. After intravenous therapy, fluconazole 200 mg orally daily was prescribed for one week. She responded well to this therapy but had recurrent swelling of the bursa. Bursectomy was recommended but she did not wish to proceed with the intervention or receive further treatment. After 3 months of follow-up, she continued to have fluid in the olecranon bursa and had some discomfort in the area.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [68, 'years'], 'creatinine': [0.5, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Female'}",102.098,96.993,107.203,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

The symptoms started insidiously and progressed to a point where his exercise tolerance was reduced to a few steps. He was a plumber by profession and a lifetime nonsmoker. He denied wheezing, fever, night sweats, chest pain, and weight loss. He had no history of hemoptysis or bleeding from any other body sites. He did not use any medications and denied recent travel or sick contacts. On physical examination, he appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His vital signs were blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, heart rate of 116/min, respiratory rate of 34/min, temperature of 99.1 F, and saturating at 96% on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. He was oriented to time place and person and was found to be using his accessory muscles of respiration. His chest examination was notable for coarse crackles on the right side without any wheezing. His cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with a 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard over the mitral area. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. His extremities were perfusing well and no peripheral edema was noted. His labs were notable for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC: 12.7 k/mm3; neutrophils: 84%; eosinophils < 1%), his electrolytes were within normal range, and renal function was deranged with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Na: 143 mEq/L; K: 4.6 mEq/L; Cl: 107 mEq/L; HCO3: 23 mEq/L; BUN: 40 mg/dL; creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL). His liver function tests (LFTs) were notable for elevated liver enzymes (AST: 48 U/L; ALT: 127 U/L). His arterial blood gas (ABG) was notable for a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 84 mmHg. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed right sided fluffy infiltrates (). He was admitted to the medical floor and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia. However, his respiratory status deteriorated and he was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was started on noninvasive mechanical ventilation (inspiratory pressure of 15 mmHg, expiratory pressure of 8 mmHg at 100% oxygen supplementation). An ABG showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 64 mmHg, and a pO2 of 68 mmHg indicative of acute respiratory acidosis. His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mmHg and 50% oxygen supplementation. The patient's CXR revealed infiltrates which were more dense and confluent (). His labs were significant for up-trending leukocytosis (15 k/mm3). The patient's blood and urine cultures were negative. Tests for legionella, mycoplasma, HIV, and influenza were also negative. Autoimmune and vasculitis panels [antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody (GBM)] tests were negative. An ABG after commencing mechanical ventilation showed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 81 mmHg. Computed tomography (CT) of his chest confirmed the presence of dense infiltrates predominantly located in the right upper and middle lobes (Figures and ). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 70%, mildly dilated left atrium, significant prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/35 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean); pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 22 mmHg, right atrial pressure of 4 mmHg, RV: 53/6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic); cardiac Index (by thermo dilution) of 2.1 liters/min/m2, and a pulmonary artery resistance of 9 wood units. Bronchoscopy revealed fresh blood in all the lobes with no obvious source and no endobronchial lesions. Sequential lavage from the right middle lobe was not progressively bloodier and hence less consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for cytology, acid fast bacillus (AFB), fungal stain, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Thoracentesis yielded 150 cc of serous fluid with a pH of 7.6, LDH of 80 U/L, protein of 0.9 g/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, cell count with a differential of 55% of neutrophils, lymphocytes of 25%, and mesothelial cells of 10%. This was consistent with a transudative pleural effusion. The cytology and culture results of the fluid from thoracentesis were also negative. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed thickening and elongation of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with myxomatous degeneration, up to 1 cm in thickness at the margin of the anterior leaflet, prolapse of posterior leaflet into left atrium, aneurysm measuring 1 × 1.6 cm2 and perforation into left atrium and severe mitral regurgitation but no vegetations. The patient continued to have increased oxygen requirements and persistent hemoptysis and eventually underwent an emergent mitral valve repair. Perioperative TEE revealed hypertrophied right and left ventricles, normal right and left ventricular function with EF of 55%, mild anteroseptal wall hypokinesis, prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet with a flail P3 segment, and severe mitral regurgitation with systolic flow reversal in right upper pulmonary vein (Figures and ). A final diagnosis of alveolar hemorrhage secondary to severe acute mitral regurgitation from myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve was made. Notably, his hemoglobin had decreased from 14.5 gm/dL to 11.7 gm/dL. Postoperative TEE did not show any evidence of mitral valve regurgitation (). A repeat bronchoscopy 3 days after the mitral valve repair showed clearing of the alveolar hemorrhage (Figures , , and ). The patient rapidly recovered thereafter as was reflected in his CXR ().",What is the patient's delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [107.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [23.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Sodium': [143.0, 'mEq/L']}",1.0,0.95,1.05,"The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 143.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 107.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 23.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L - (107.0 mEq/L + 23.0 mEq/L) = 13.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 13.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 13.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 13.0 - 12 = 1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 1.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 1.0 mEq/L / 1.0 mEq/L = 1.0. The patient's delta ratio is 1.0."
4666,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-5698679-1,Extracted,"A 22-month-old girl diagnosed with Sandhoff disease was referred to our hospital with chief complaints of spasticity and swallowing difficulty as well as difficulty with head control. She was born at full term through normal vaginal delivery. She was able to stand while holding on to something at 8 months of age, which suggested normal development. However, developmental arrest occurred at 13 months of age. Spasticity and genu recurvatum were observed while standing and holding on to something. The patient showed a progressive motor regression pattern, and at 18 months of age, she could barely maintain a propped sitting position. At 20 months of age, she showed symptoms of aspiration while swallowing and prolonged feeding time.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at 15 months of age did not show delayed myelination or abnormal enhancement (). Developmental regression was similar to that in GM2 gangliosidosis, such as Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease. The patient underwent hexosaminidase assay in white blood cells, which showed increased hexosaminidase A (%) and decreased total hexosaminidase. The total hexosaminidase A & B and hexosaminidase A levels were 321.2 nmol/hr/mg (reference range, 620–1,000 nmol/hr/mg) and 74.3% (reference range, 55%–72%), respectively. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with Sandhoff disease. However, the patient did not show cherry red spot on fundoscopy.
At the time of admission, physical examination revealed grade 3 and 2 muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities, respectively. Neurological examination showed sustained ankle clonus and increased deep tendon reflexes in all extremities as well as hypertonicity and decerebrate posture manifested by an exaggerated extensor posture of all extremities, while crying and/or when she was irritable (). In terms of spasticity, her four extremities scored grade 2 based on the modified Ashworth scale (MAS).
Overall, the patient had developmental regression. Especially, she showed a delay in development by 1 month in gross-motor domain, by 3 months in language and fine motor domain, and by 2 months in personal-social interaction domain in the Denver Developmental Screening Test II.
Dietary assessment revealed that the patient irregularly ingested a soft and blended diet of 70–130 kcal, five times a day, and the mean eating duration was approximately 1 hour. She had difficulty in eating and she showed signs of aspiration (e.g., coughing, gagging). Moreover, she had a poor feeding posture with inadequate trunk and head support.
Oral motor function assessment showed that the patient had increased tone and decreased movement of the tongue and hypersensitivity in the oral and perioral areas. The patient underwent videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), and was given barium-containing free water, yogurt (thick liquid), and rice porridge (soft). In the oral phase, motor control, including lip sealing, tongue control, and mastication, was inadequate with delayed oral transit time (1.3 seconds) and premature bolus loss []. In the pharyngeal phase, a delayed swallow reflex was observed without aspiration or penetration during or after swallowing ().
The patient's height and body weight were 85.0 cm and 11.6 kg, respectively. Her weight-for-height Z-score (−0.3) was in the 15th–50th percentile of the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards []. Nutritional evaluation showed that the patient needed a regular daily intake of 989 kcal. However, she could only consume 700 kcal/day, which was less than the required caloric intake. The patient was given supplementary balanced nutrition twice a day.
The patient received an intensive dysphagia rehabilitation program for 30 minutes a day, five times a week, for 6 weeks, and it comprised both direct and indirect interventions, such as oromotor facilitation, thermo-tactile stimulation, and lip strengthening, and compensatory techniques, such as postural modification and alteration of the feeding utensil to facilitate swallowing []. She was given anti-spasticity drugs for managing spasticity and achieving a stable posture during feeding. After the treatment, she was fed in a semi-reclined position, which reduced the signs of aspiration and the amount of food or liquid leakage from the mouth.
However, her nutritional status showed no improvement, with her daily calorie intake decreasing to 600 kcal/day after 4 weeks of admission. At 6 weeks postadmission, her total intake further decreased to 392 kcal/day. Her body weight continuously declined from 11.6 kg to 10.5 kg, and her weight-for-height Z-score (−1.6) decreased to the 3rd–15th percentile of the WHO growth standards, which was a sharp decrease of one major percentile line in a short period [].
Gastrostomy was therefore recommended, but her parents refused the procedure. She was then referred to another hospital for treatment of deconditioning due to dehydration, and she received gastrostomy.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [11.6, 'kg']}",43.2,41.04,45.36,"The patient's weight is 11.6 kg.

He had been born at full term and his growth and development had been normal. There was no family history of renal disease. Physical findings were as follows: height 174.0 cm, weight 71.5 kg, body mass index 23.6, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. He did not suffer from deafness. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Urine dipstick analysis was negative for occult blood and 2+ for protein. Urinary protein was 1.6–3.0 g/day. The urinary sediment contained <1 erythrocyte and 3–5 leukocytes per high-power field. Hematocrit was 43.0%, hemoglobin concentration 15.2 g/dl, platelet count 277,000/μl, and leukocyte count 6,200/μl. The serum urea nitrogen level was 15.4 mg/dl, creatinine 1.0 mg/dl, uric acid 7.9 mg/dl, cholesterol 222 mg/dl, total protein 7.2 g/dl, and albumin, 4.9 g/dl. IgG level was 1,070 mg/dl, IgA 139 mg/dl, and IgM 84 mg/dl. Total complement level was 35 IU/l, C3 72 mg/dl, C4 29.5 mg/dl, and C1Q 12.8 mg/dl. Antinuclear antibody was negative. The remaining autoimmune serological findings were within the normal range, and serum viral hepatitis markers were negative. Abdominal computed tomography and ultrasound showed slightly small kidneys with bilateral cysts. Funduscopic examination by portable ophthalmoscope was normal. On the eighth hospital day, a right renal biopsy was performed. Under light microscopy, ten glomeruli and a localized area of tubular atrophy were found (fig. ). One glomerulus was obsolescent and in another there was segmental sclerosis with hyaline deposits near the vascular pole (fig. ). Other glomeruli were slightly enlarged and had essentially minor changes, but in several segments a questionable increased mesangium was observed (fig. ). By immunofluorescence, no significant deposits of immunoglobulins or complement components were found, except for weak granular mesangial and paramesangial IgM deposits. From the clinical and histological findings, idiopathic FSGS was considered as a tentative diagnosis. Initially he was treated with platelet aggregation inhibitor and low-protein diets in our outpatient clinic, but the treatment was interrupted 3 months after admission. At the age of 31 years, he visited our hospital again to be checked for proteinuria. His urinary protein was 51 mg/dl and 0.8 g/day, his serum urea nitrogen level was 17.3 mg/dl, and creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl. To clarify the indication of prednisolone, a second renal biopsy was performed. Under light microscopy, only five glomeruli were found, but significant histological changes were not observed expect for focal tubular atrophy with mild interstitial cell infiltration. The patient was treated with 40 mg/day of prednisolone with gradual tapering for 18 months in our outpatient clinic, but the proteinuria was steroid-resistant and remained at about 1.0–1.5 g/day. His renal function gradually worsened. At the age of 52 years, his urinary protein was 64 mg/dl and his serum creatinine level 1.73 mg/dl.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [27, 'years'], 'weight': [71.5, 'kg'], 'height': [174.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [1.0, 'mg/dL']}",109.169,103.711,114.627,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 27 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 174.0 cm, which is 174.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.74 m. The patient's weight is 71.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 71.5 kg / (1.74 m * 1.74 m) = 23.616 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.6, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 69.559 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 27) * 69.559 * 1) / (1.0 * 72) = 109.169 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 109.169 mL/min."

The patient was infected by chronic HBV 20 years proir. The α-FP level was 1,000.00 ng/mL and the liver function was normal (Child-pugh A). CT scan showed that the liver was cirrhotic with a huge lesion in the right liver, which was considered as hepatocellular carcinoma, and a small lesion in the left liver was a typical hemangioma (). The FLR volume was calculated to be 356.0 cm3 (29.1% of 1,223.3 cm3 of the stander liver volume) based on the preoperative CT scan. It is reported that an FLR >30% of the stander liver volume is considered as a safe scope for hepatoectomy []. However, our criteria is FLR >45% of the stander liver volume for patients with cirrhosis. Given the high risk of postoperative liver failure for the patient, a 2-stage surgery should be adopted to increase the FLR. Although compared with portal vein embolization, ALPPS provides a better chance of complete resection for patients with primarily unresectable liver tumor, the morbidity from ALPPS was very high []. Thus, we decided to perform an AMAPS (a modified ALPPS) for this patient.
In the first stage of operation, abdominal laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia. After abdominal exploration and cholecystectomy, the right hepatic pedicle was dissected carefully, and the right hepatic artery was isolated and tagged with the homemade rubber strip, which also reduced adhesion around the right hepatic artery by the large flat area. Then, the right portal vein was freed and ligated (). After the falciform ligament was divided, the future transection plane was marked with ultrasound guiding. The microwave antenna, which was guided by ultrasound, was inserted into the liver parenchyma on the right future transection plane, setting a 4-minute and 70 watts output cycle (). This manner was repeated step by step every 2.5 cm to create an avascular groove along the future transection plane.
The duration of the first-stage operation was 210 minutes with a blood loss of 100 mL with no need for blood transfusion or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The postoperative FLR was re-evaluated by CT scan weekly. The FLR was estimated at 430.6 cm3 (35.2% of the stander liver volume) after 1 week, and was increased to 500.3 cm3 (40.9% of the stander liver volume) after 2 weeks. On postoperative day 20, the volume of left hepatic was increased to 626.3 cm3 (51.2% of the stander liver volume; FLR increase 75.9%; daily FLR increase 13.5 cm3/day), without any metastatic tumors ().
The second-stage operation was performed 21 days after the first-stage operation. Little adhesion was found during the laparotomy. The right hepatic artery was easily identified and divided through the homemade rubber tag. The right portal vein was found below the right hepatic artery and was divided. Then, a bloodless blunt liver resection was performed along the future transaction plane with an anterior approach (). The right biliary duct was indentified and sutured during the parenchymal transection. The median and right hepatic veins were divided and sutured last.
The duration of the second-stage operation was 100 minutes with a blood loss of 200 mL, and there was no need for blood transfusion or ICU admission. The result of pathology demonstrated a hepatocellular carcinoma with poor differentiation, and the resection margin was tumor-free (R0). The patient recovered without any complications and was discharged on postoperative day 7. No tumor relapse or metastasis was detected (), and the α-fetoprotein level was normal at three months after the surgery.",What is the patient's body surface area?

6532,44,LDL Calculated,lab test,decimal,pmc-4722418-1,Extracted,"A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypertension by a private clinic in August 2013, based upon a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and she was prescribed antihypertensive drugs to treat the condition. Initial therapy consisted of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and losartan 50 mg daily. After 1 week, her blood pressure was still high, so the doctor changed her medication to amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and indapamide 2.5 mg per day. Five days after initiating this second regimen of drugs, she developed pretibial pitting edema, and thorough workup was done for the symptom. There were bilateral adrenal masses on abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT). Routine blood tests revealed the following: potassium 2.2 mmol/L, plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.12 ng/mL/hr, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 16.76 ng/dL, and an aldosterone/renin ratio (PAC/PRA) >30, indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism.
Following her possible diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism, the patient was referred to our hospital for additional testing. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 155/111 mm Hg, height was 164.5 cm, and weight was 63.5 kg (body mass index, 23.47 kg/m2). Pretibial pitting edemas were detected, but no physical signs of Cushing syndrome were observed.
A routine blood test at the time of admission showed the following: white blood cell 6,900/µL, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet 351,000/µL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 76 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 126 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 7.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, total cholesterol 210 mg/dL, triglyceride 104 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 50 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 141 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c 5.9%. Biochemical evaluation of pheochromocytoma showed no excessive catecholamine production. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient was 12.64%, suggesting the possibility of hyperaldosteronism or hypercortisolism. PAC and PRA were 24.4 ng/dL and 0.76 ng/mL/hr, respectively, and the PAC/PRA ratio was 32.11 (). After correcting for hypokalemia, a saline loading test was performed, which revealed no suppression of the aldosterone level after saline administration, consistent with a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism (the basal PAC 24.4 ng/dL increased to 27.3 ng/dL after a 2 L saline infusion). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) resulted in no suppression of cortisol levels (). Adrenal CT demonstrated two bilateral adrenal masses in each of the adrenal glands, including a 1.6-cm mass on the right and a 2-cm mass on the left adrenal gland (). An adrenal cortical scan using iodine-131-6β-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) showed focally increased radioactive uptakes in the bilateral adrenal gland areas, with a substantially higher uptake on the left side ().
Bilateral adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation () revealed inadequate right adrenal venous blood sampling (right adrenal vein cortisol level/peripheral blood cortisol level [CRt/CP] <10), whereas the cortisol concentration in the left adrenal venous blood showed successful sampling on the left side. One explanation for this difference may be that the low level of CRt was the result of suppressed cortisol secretion due to excessive cortisol secretion from the left adrenal mass. The left adrenal vein aldosterone/cortisol (ALt/CLt) ratio was lower than that of peripheral blood, implying the possibility of suppressed aldosterone secretion from this side caused by a contralateral adrenal mass which might secrete excessive aldosterone []. Four days after the first AVS, a second AVS was performed using low-dose DST but without ACTH infusion (). This time, we also measured the epinephrine levels in the both adrenal veins and peripheral blood; a large peripheral-to-adrenal gradient of epinephrine assured successful catheterization on both sides []. CLt/CP testing confirmed that the left adrenal mass was a cortisol-secreting adenoma [].
Even though those two AVS results appeared to provide clear evidence of the lateralization of functioning adrenal masses, such an independent functioning of bilateral masses was highly suspicious. We therefore concluded that sequential adrenalectomies, rather than concurrent operations, would be beneficial for making a definitive diagnosis. Moreover, the patient agreed to do sequential operations. The first procedure was a laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy of the right adrenal gland to remove the putative aldosterone-producing mass, with the goal of controlling hypertension and hypokalemia. A firm, 1.5-cm ovoid, well-circumscribed, bright yellow tumor mass lacking necrosis or hemorrhage was arising from the cortex of the adrenal gland in the pathologic specimen. Within 24 hours after surgery, the patient's blood pressure had fallen to 110/80 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, serum potassium normalized at 4.5 mmol/L, and PAC decreased to 3 ng/dL. These large postoperative changes strongly suggested that the right adrenal adenoma was producing excessive aldosterone. By day 3, an overnight DST continued to show no cortisol suppression, indicating persistent secretion of corticosteroid from the left adrenal mass. To limit the likelihood of subclinical Cushing syndrome progressing to overt Cushing syndrome, we opted to completely remove the left adrenal gland as a means of controlling hypercortisolism. The excised portion of the adrenal mass contained an encapsulated brown solid mass.
The patient began taking prednisolone 10 mg once a day for steroid replacement 1 day after the second surgery. By 2 months she had lost 5 kg of body weight. At that time, a rapid ACTH test revealed adrenal insufficiency (). At 16 months after surgery, the patient has gradually reduced her prednisolone intake to 5 mg every other day. Her blood pressure and serum potassium levels have remained within normal ranges, without the need for additional antihypertensive medications or potassium supplements.",What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Adequate sensory and motor block was achieved. But within 10 min after injection of local anesthetic solution, patient complained of increased sweating in the face and diminished vision in the left eye. On examination, sweating was confined to the left half of the face with widened palpebral fissure of the left eye and the left pupil was dilated in comparison to the right pupil (4 mm/2 mm). Patient was reassured and the surgery was completed successfully. These symptoms resolved when the plexus functions returned to normal.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [70.0, 'kg']}",110.0,104.5,115.5,"The patient's weight is 70.0 kg.

She received induction with alemtuzumab and solumedrol and was maintained on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. There were no surgical complications or episodes of acute rejection in the post-transplant period. Allograft function was excellent with serum Cr of 1.0 mg/dL. Pre-transplant work up was notable for positive TST with normal CXR. She was started on INH immediately after transplant and received nine months of therapy for LTBI. One month after completing INH therapy, she was admitted with persistent fevers, night sweats and acute kidney injury, serum Cr of 2 mg/dL. Fever work up showed adenovirus in the blood and urine. There was increased flurodeoxyglucose uptake in the kidney allograft on positron emission tomography scan. Biopsy of the kidney transplant showed necrotizing granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Differential diagnosis of the granulomatous interstitial nephritis included renal transplant TB and adenovirus infection. Renal pathology changes were not consistent with adenovirus infection. AFB smear and cultures were negative in the urine and renal biopsy specimens. Due to persistent fevers, worsening renal function and clinical suspicion for TB, she was started on RIPE and Moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin was added as a fifth agent due to concern for INH resistance given she was treated with INH monotherapy for LTBI. Fevers, night sweats and AKI resolved on treatment without addition of cidofovir, which supported the diagnosis of renal transplant TB. Her IS was modified with discontinuation of MMF. She is currently maintained on tacrolimus and prednisone. She completed 6 mo of ATT and is cured of TB. Renal allograft function is stable with Cr of 1.3 mg/dL.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [38, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.3, 'mg/dL']}",53.978,51.279,56.677,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 38 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.3/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**38 * 1.012 = 53.978.

He presented to the clinic due to the spread of the symptoms to his upper limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lacuna infarctions. Laboratory analysis revealed anemia (hemoglobin [Hb], 9.8 g/dL) and renal dysfunction (creatine, 2.7 mg/dL). He was admitted to a nearby hospital for further examination and was diagnosed with hypertension and multiple mononeuropathy. In addition, laboratory findings revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, 16.82 mg/dL). After 8 days in the hospital, severe right-flank pain suddenly occurred, and anemia worsened (Hb, 6.8 g/dL). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) without enhancement revealed a right perirenal hematoma. He was then transferred to our hospital for investigation and treatment.
On admission, his height was 156.0 cm, and his weight was 54.5 kg (approximately 2-kg loss over months). His blood pressure was 192/114 mm Hg; pulse, 98 bpm; and body temperature, 37.1 ℃. On physical examination, palpebral conjunctiva was pallid, and he had severe right-flank pain with muscular defense. No skin rush was evident in the extremities, although hypesthesia was detected by neurologic examination. Laboratory findings on admission are presented in Table . The results of the urine tests were as follows: protein levels, 2.4 g/g⋅Cr; occult blood 3+ by dipstick test; red blood cells ≧ 100/high-power field; and sediment contained granular cast 2+ . The results of serum examinations were as follows: white blood count, 13,610/µL (with 74.0% neutrophils and 16.0% eosinophils); hemoglobin, 6.2 g/dL; platelet count, 32.1 × 104/µL; alkaline phosphatase, 1,867 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 360 IU/L; blood urea nitrogen, 39 mg/dL; Cr, 1.3 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 156 mm; C-reactive protein, 11.5 mg/dL; immunoglobulin (Ig) G, 2533 mg/dL; IgA, 306 mg/dL; IgM, 106 mg/dL; C3, 83 mg/dL; C4, 15 mg/dL; and CH50, 48 U/mL. ANA, PR3-ANCA, MPO-ANCA, anti-GBM antibody, and HBs-antigenemia were not detected. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed bilateral pleural effusion, right small renal infarction, and right perirenal hematoma. CT angiography revealed multiple small aneurysmal dilatations in the intrarenal branches of the bilateral renal arteries and the intrasplenic branches of the splenic artery (Fig. a–c). Emergency selective coil embolization was conducted to the right renal artery aneurysm, which was responsible for the bleeding (Fig. ). To obtain a definitive diagnosis, we performed a left sural nerve biopsy (Fig. ). We confirmed a small arterial occlusion with inflammatory cell infiltration in the sural nerve tissue, although a histological examination did not reveal fibrinoid necrosis or granuloma. Collectively, and based on his clinical and radiographic findings, we diagnosed polyarteritis nodosa.
On the fifth hospital day, we started oral prednisolone therapy at 40 mg/day. On the 8th and 15th hospital days, intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (500 mg/day) therapy was started for 3 consecutive days. Although these therapies suppressed the disease activity, including inflammatory response, urine protein, and pleural effusion, the patient failed to achieve remission. Intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide therapy was, therefore, given on the 30th day. Clinical symptoms such as numbness and weakness of limbs gradually diminished, and laboratory findings dramatically improved. Moreover, contrast-enhanced CT revealed the disappearance of pleural effusion and the decreased size of perirenal hematoma concomitant with aneurysms. The patient was then transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation training (Fig. ).","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [54.5, 'kg'], 'height': [156.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [2.7, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [67, 'years']}",20.0,19.0,21.0,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 67 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 2.7 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 156.0 cm, which is 156.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.56 m. The patient's weight is 54.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 54.5 kg / (1.56 m * 1.56 m) = 22.395 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.4, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 53.259 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 67) * 53.259 * 1) / (2.7 * 72) = 20.0 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 20.0 mL/min."

MRI revealed a mass lesion with ring-like enhancement (45 × 42 × 48 mm) in the left frontal lobe with midline shift. Awake craniotomy with iMRI was scheduled because the tumour was located in the left superior and middle frontal gyri.
General anaesthesia was induced. Following left frontal craniotomy and dural incision, the first iMRI was performed (Fig. ). One hundred fifty-eight minutes from induction, the patient regained consciousness after all anaesthetics were ceased. Tumour resection was performed with free conversation. However, after 143 min of surgery under the awake condition, the patient came to complain of excessive sleepiness though she could respond to verbal commands. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) did not detect after-discharge. The tumour was successfully removed en bloc fashion. Progressive brain swelling was not observed. The second iMRI was commenced 182 min into the awake phase (Fig. ). Thirteen minutes from the beginning of the second iMRI scanning, the patient did not respond to noxious stimuli. When the patient was removed from the gantry, she was unconscious and had stopped spontaneous breathing. Her pupils were isocoria and did not dilate. Neither epileptic seizure nor anaphylactic reaction occurred. The peripheral oxygen saturation was not measurable, but cardiac instability or signs of vomiting were not observed. We decided to discontinue the operation under the awake status. No electrolyte imbalance or hypoglycaemia was observed. Subsequently performed iMRI identified a thin subdural haematoma in the contralateral side (Fig. ). The fourth iMRI confirmed that most of the haematoma was evacuated following right frontal craniotomy.

Her history was notable for premature birth at 29 weeks, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and necrotizing enterocolitis. History was limited as patient's father was present during her medical evaluation, and patient was in mother's care prior to arrival. Of note, parents were separated but still shared custody.
Initial evaluation at an outside facility included a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which revealed a sodium of 176 mmol/L. She was given a lactated Ringer's bolus, resulting in a decrease of her sodium to 171 mmol/L. provides the initial lab results. Other testing included a rapid strep test, chest X-ray, complete blood count, and influenza and COVID-19 testing, all of which were unremarkable. A urinalysis was notable for specific gravity 1.020, ketones 5 mg/dL, protein 500 mg/dL, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase 100, and white blood cells 10–15 HPF. She was then transferred to Norton Children's Hospital for further management of hypernatremia. During transport, the patient reported hunger and stated that she was not given food at home.
On arrival to our facility, a basic metabolic panel (BMP) was repeated which was notable for sodium 158 mmol/L, potassium 2.7 mmol/L, chloride 119 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 32 mmol/L, and glucose 108 mg/dL. Random urine sodium and random urine creatinine were within normal limits. Random urine osmolality was decreased at 99.5 mOsm/kg, and serum osmolality was increased at 330 mOsm/kg. Given these findings, pediatric endocrinology was consulted due to hypernatremia and concern for DI. Additional labs showed a low prealbumin of 8 mg/dL (reference range: 11.0–23.0 mg/dL), normal renin activity of 4.5 ng/mL/hr, low aldosterone of <3.0 ng/dL (reference range 4.0–44.0 ng/dL), and normal AM cortisol of 13.7 ug/dL. She was started on normal saline fluids, given oral potassium-chloride replacement, and admitted to the pediatric ICU for further management.
On day 2 of admission, her sodium level trended down to 155 mmol/L with fluid resuscitation and her appetite improved. However, her urine output (UOP) was significantly elevated at 8.28 mL/kg/hr. Dad denied any history of polyuria or polydipsia. She was toilet trained and had no history of accidents. She had been meeting developmental milestones and doing well in virtual kindergarten.
Her weight on admission was 15.1 kg (1.8th percentile), height was 106 cm (8.9th percentile), and BMI was 13.44 kg/m2 (4.8th percentile). Of note, at 2 years of age, her height was in the 71st percentile and weight in the 30th percentile. Given these findings along with her significant electrolyte abnormalities on presentation, forensics was consulted due to concerns for chronic malnutrition. Additional work up included thyroid studies, which showed a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of 6.050 IU/mL (reference range: 0.470–4.680 IU/mL) and free thyroxine (T4) of 1.49 ng/dL (reference range: 0.78–2.19 ng/dL). Her celiac panel was negative, and growth factors were normal for age.
Our patient's sodium level improved with IV fluids and oral intake. Her hypokalemia and alkalosis also improved with potassium-chloride replacement. She was noted to have a mild acute kidney injury on admission with an elevated creatinine of 0.77 mg/dL, but her creatinine level normalized quickly with rehydration. Although clinical evidence of dehydration resolved, including physical examination findings and normalization of her heart rate and blood pressure, her sodium level rose to 149–150 mmol/L each time IV fluids were weaned. She also continued to have polyuria, although this slowly improved throughout admission. Due to the persistent hypernatremia and polyuria, DI continued to be a concern, and a modified water deprivation test was performed. During a traditional water deprivation test, the patient is made NPO, and serial labs are checked every 1-2 hours. These labs include serum sodium, serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine specific gravity. If the patient has DI, the urine osmolality and specific gravity will remain low despite a high serum osmolality and hypernatremia []. In our patient's case, she was made NPO at midnight, and fasting AM labs were obtained. Initial labs were concerning for DI with a low urine osmolality in the setting of a high serum sodium and serum osmolality. Desmopressin (DDAVP) was ordered to determine if administration would lead to concentration of urine. This would differentiate central from nephrogenic DI. However, before DDAVP could be given, father allowed the patient to drink. Of note, her UOP had decreased significantly, and so the decision was made to monitor. Another water deprivation test was performed overnight, and results were not consistent with DI. The lab results from her water deprivation tests are given in .
While these mixed results were not consistent with a frank diagnosis of complete vasopressin deficiency, the possibility of a partial DI diagnosis was considered. A pituitary MRI with and without contrast was obtained to look for abnormalities that may explain her findings. This showed a normal pituitary gland with decreased bright spot on T1 weighted imaging, likely within range of normal. This decrease in the bright spot has been reported in patients with DI but is also a normal variant found in 10% of the general population [].
At discharge, our patient's sodium level had remained within normal range for several days off IV fluids and despite fasting for prolonged periods of time. Her weight increased from 15.1 kg to 16.3 kg during admission. She was discharged in the care of her father per child protective services with a plan for close follow-up.
She was seen by pediatric endocrinology two weeks after hospital discharge, and her father reported no signs of excessive urination or excessive thirst. Her weight was up to 17.3 kg from 16.3 kg at discharge. A BMP, thyroid function studies, and repeat growth factors were all within normal limits. At her endocrinology follow-up three months later, a repeat CMP was still normal, and she had no symptoms of polyuria or polydipsia. She continued to have appropriate weight gain. Based on her course, findings, and resolution of symptoms with adequate weight gain, she was diagnosed with hypernatremia and dehydration related to sporadic vasopressin release secondary to her malnutrition.",What is the patient's body surface area?

The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 142.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 142.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 142.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 21.0 mmol. To convert 21.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.021 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.021 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.783 g glucose. To convert 3.783 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.783 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 3783.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3783.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 378.3 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 21.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 378.3 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 142.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (378.3 - 100) = 148.679 mEq/L.

He underwent T3-5 laminectomy for OLF-induced myelopathy and L2-4 postero-lateral fusion with instrumentation for canal stenosis (). He was symptom free for five years. When the symptoms started again and increased in intensity, the patient was referred to our institution for further management. On admission, the preoperative examination revealed grade 4 muscle strength and hypoesthesia below at the T7 area. He could perform the one-leg standing test on each leg, but only for two seconds. He was hyperreflexive in both lower limbs with a bilateral Babinski response. His preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA score) was 12 (4, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3) in cervical and 6 (2, 0, 1, 3) in thoracic. The patient had a height of 183 cm and weight of 122 kg; and his age-adjusted body mass index was 36.4 kg/m2.
Plain radiographs of the spine showed 47° thoracic kyphosis (T1-12), 26° thoracolumbar kyphosis (T10-L2) and 8.6 cm of sagittal vertical axis (SVA) (). Reconstructed computed tomography (CT) showed OPLL from C2-5 and T3-6 (). The spinal cord was compressed by OLF at T1-3 and T7-11 (). The cervical cord was also compressed moderately at multiple levels. We performed C3-7 laminoplasty (), T1-11 laminectomy and T6-9 posterior fusion with instrumentation, as there were multiple levels with severe OLF. Also more than half of the facets at the kyphotic thoracic spine needed facetectomy, although mobile segments were to be preserved with a fused L2-4 (). After surgery, his symptoms disappeared except for slight numbness in legs, and the patient returned to work.
Eleven months after the surgery, the patient presented with severe pain in the lower back, numbness in both legs and gait disturbance. He had been asymptomatic until that time. His JOA score had deteriorated to 8 (3, 1, 2, 2) in cervical and 3 (1, 0, 0, 2) in thoracic. On radiological evaluation, thoracolumbar kyphosis had progressed from 26° to 39° (). MRI revealed a severely compressed spinal cord with high intensity areas at the T10-11 level (). CT showed relapsed ossification: a small ossification medial to the T11 superior articular process, extending to the inferior articular process of T10 and along the dura mater at that same level (). Considering the situation, we performed a revision surgery, wherein we fused from T6 to L4 with instrumentation and removed the propagated ossification at T10/11 using navigation. However, due to the ossification of the dura mater, we were unable to completely resect the OLF, and we allowed some areas to float. We confirmed decompression of spinal cord by echo imaging. The postoperative course was uneventful, and his neurologic improvements were excellent with relief of low back pain. The patient could walk on the fifth postoperative day. Two years after the last surgery, the patient is pain free and walking comfortably without support, and his JOA score is 9 (3, 1, 2, 3).

9007,63,Delta Gap,lab test,decimal,pmc-6398077-1,Extracted,"Clinical History. A 27-year-old African American male with a history of unprovoked recurrent right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and bilateral testicular hydrocele presented with a 4-week history of bilateral flank and generalized nonradiating lower abdominal pain. The pain was described as constant ache, associated with early satiety, but without nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. He denied weight loss or any urinary symptoms. Social history was negative for tobacco smoking and alcohol or recreational drug use. Medications included diphenhydramine as needed for sleep and apixaban.
Physical Exam. Vital vital signs revealed temperature 37.1°C, blood pressure 121/69 mmHg, pulse 96 beats/minute, and respiratory rate 16/minute. Lungs and heart exams were unremarkable. Lower half abdomen was mildly tender with palpation, but without mass, rebound, or guarding. There was mild right costovertebral angle tenderness and trace bilateral pedal edema. Genitalia were within normal limits without edema.
Initial Laboratory Data. Routine chemistry revealed serum sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 5.0 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate 25 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 57 mg/dL, creatinine 12.6 mg/dL (baseline of 1.0 mg/dL one month prior), estimated glomerular filtration rate 6 mL/min/1.73 m2, and calcium 8.6 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed specific gravity 1.014, pH 8.0, no red or white blood cells, 100 mg/dL protein, and no glucose or blood. Urine protein to creatinine and albumin to creatinine ratios were 0.5 and 0.293 g/g creatinine respectively. Renal ultrasound and abdomen/pelvis CT without contrast revealed mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with nonspecific inflammatory changes ().
The bland urinalysis and lack of significant proteinuria/albuminuria suggest tubulointerstitial injury (late phase of acute tubular necrosis, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis) or obstructive uropathy. Differential diagnoses of obstructive uropathy relevant to current African American patient with unknown sickle cell history include recently passed papillary necrotic tissues or bladder stone, complicated medullary carcinoma (associated with sickle cell trait), diphenhydramine-induced neurogenic bladder, or retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF). Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is thought to be less likely given the bland urinalysis.
Additional Investigations. Given the mismatched relatively benign findings of both urinalyses and imaging studies and degree of kidney failure and associated symptomology suspicious for RPF, an abdomen and pelvis CT with intravenous contrast was obtained.
Abdomen and pelvis computed tomogram with intravenous contrast revealed mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with point of obstruction at the level of distal abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. There was an ill-defined, infiltrative soft tissue mass encasing both aorta, and inferior vena cava (approximately 7.2 cm). The mass appeared to infiltrate along the bilateral proximal common iliac vessels ().
Serologies to evaluate for autoimmune diseases and infectious etiologies including C-reactive-protein, human-immunodeficiency-virus, QuantiFERON gold, and antinuclear-antibody were negative. Serum lactate dehydrogenase obtained for possible lymphoproliferative disorder was mildly elevated at 248 IU (reference <192 IU). IgG4 level was 44.2 mg/dL (reference 4-86 mg/dL). Laparoscopic retroperitoneal mass biopsy revealed dense fibroadipose tissue with lymphocytic aggregates, focal scattered IgG4 positive plasma cells, and fibrin deposition without malignant cells.
Diagnoses. The diagnosis of idiopathic RPF was made. Kidney failure was thought to be due to severe bilateral ureteral encasement by RPF.
Clinical Follow-Up. Patient underwent bilateral nephrostomy placement with rapid improvement of serum creatinine. In addition, patient received a trial of prednisone 40 mg daily. At 4-month follow-up, kidney function normalized and CT revealed marked reduction in RPF size ().",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [98.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [25.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Sodium': [133.0, 'mEq/L']}",-2.0,-2.1,-1.9,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 98.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 25.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 10.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 10.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 10.0 - 12 = -2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -2.0 mEq/L."

Upper endoscopy revealed a circumferential ulcerated mass extending from 25 cm to 32 cm from the incisors, precluding passage of an adult gastroscope. The exchange for a pediatric gastroscope allowed for further evaluation and revealed a patch of nodular mucosa with ulceration at 23 cm from the incisors (Figure ).

This case was diagnosed as a case of congenital heart disease at 9 months of pregnancy by a primary care physician and referred to our hospital for safe confinement. Patient had a history of palpitations not associated with chest pain or any syncopal attack. At 15 years of age patient had breathlessness for which she was prescribed tablet furosemide 40 mg overdose (OD) by her primary care physician. She continued the medication only for 1-year. Previous echocardiographic evaluation done 3 years prior was suggestive of congenital heart disease (large VSD with severe pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, bidirectional shunt). Patient had gestational hypertension detected in the third trimester, but was not on any treatment. Patient had also been diagnosed as a case of hypothyroidism 1-year back and was on tablet eltroxin 50 µg OD. Otherwise she was asymptomatic throughout her pregnancy.
On physical examination, patient was of average body build, with weight of 48 kg, pulse rate of 80/min, good volume with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg in supine position and 150/90 in left lateral position. There was grade II clubbing and cyanosis. Her room air SpO2 was 80–85% and increased to 92% with oxygen supplementation. There was no pedal edema. Cardiovascular system revealed apex beat shifted to 6th intercostal space lateral to mid clavicular line. S1, S2 were normally heard, there was a loud p2 and a grade III holosystolic murmur heard in the right lower sternal border radiating to axilla. Patient's respiratory rate was 20/min with bilateral vesicular breath sounds with few basal crepitations. Fundal height corresponded to 32 weeks of gestation, fetal heart sound was well heard with a heart rate of 140/min. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a live fetus with intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Electrocardiography findings were sinus rhythm with first degree heart block, right bundle branch block and right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography revealed a large sub-pulmonic VSD, bi-directional shunt, severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) with right ventricular hypertrophy. Both the great vessels originated from the right ventricle (RV), suggestive of DORV []. Investigations showed hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, a platelet count of 2.2 lakhs/mm3 and an INR of 1.2. After shifting the patient to operation theater table, a wedge was kept under the right hip and oxygen supplementation was carried out by mask. After connecting all standard monitors, she was put in left lateral position and preloaded with 200 ml crystalloids slowly. Under full aseptic precautions, after local infiltration, an 18 gauge Tuohy epidural needle was used to locate the epidural space by loss of resistance to air at L2-L3 interspace and an epidural catheter was threaded 4 cm inside. Test dose was given and there was no evidence of intravascular or subarachnoid placement. Patient was turned to supine position, and a wedge placed under the right hip. Patient continued to receive supplemental oxygen by mask. As the expected duration of the surgery was <1 h, we used 2% lignocaine through the epidural catheter. After giving 5 ml of lignocaine 2% initially through the epidural catheter we waited for 5 min. Adequate level was not achieved. Additional 5 ml of lignocaine 2% was repeated and level was checked. After injecting another 3 ml of 2% lignocaine, a T6 level was achieved. A total volume of 16 ml of lignocaine was given including the test dose.

The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mEq. To convert from 138.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 138.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 138.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 138.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 138.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 14.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 90.0 mg/dL.

8116,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-5680775-1,Extracted,"The case we discuss is that of Mr. H, a 90-year-old patient with end-stage kidney disease, diagnosed as nephroangiosclerosis. This clinical diagnosis was based on a long-standing history of hypertension, the presence of diffuse signs of vascular disease, the absence of severe proteinuria, relevant haematuria or systemic symptoms suggesting a different cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, up to the last CKD phase, the progression trajectory had been relatively slow, after which a relatively rapid increase in creatinine was observed in the course of 1 year (creatinine 1.52 mg/dl in February 2007, 2.5 mg/dl in November 2015, 2.7 mg/dl in January 2016, 3.1 mg/dl in March 2016).
In June 2016 Mr. H was hospitalised for a further reduction in kidney function, probably after an oligo-symptomatic infection (C-reactive protein 71 mg/l, fibrinogen: 7.44 g/l). At hospitalisation, serum creatinine had reached 7.5 mg/dl, with severe acidosis (bicarbonate 15 mEq/l) and anaemia (haemoglobin 7.9 g/dl). The possibility of a cholesterol emboli syndrome was also considered, on account of the diffuse vascular disease observed, but no eosinophilia, livedo reticularis or skin lesions were present.
At hospitalisation, the patient’s weight was 80.7 kg, for a body mass index of 30.7 Kg/m2 (height 1.62 m), with no clinical signs of malnutrition; severe arthrosis and diffuse leg hyperkeratosis were also part of the clinical picture. During hospitalisation his general metabolic balance improved, but his serum creatinine stabilised between 6.0 and 7.0 mg/dL.
At 90 years of age, Mr. H lived alone, with help from the social services for home management; he received a hot meal at noon from a retirement home (in line with the usual organization of French home support). The meal served as a basis for lunch and supper, supplemented with bread, potatoes, or cheese. He kept a garden and claimed to grow the best potatoes in the area.
While the usual prognostic indexes may not be of great help in patients in advanced old age, his Charlson index was 9 (high comorbidity, two-year survival probability of 30%), i.e. a comorbidity mainly linked to age and end-stage kidney disease. Perhaps more importantly, given the close link between nutritional status and survival, his SGA (subjective global assessment) score was A (well nourished) and his MIS (malnutrition inflammation score) index was 3 (optimal).
With this background, the decision on whether or not to start dialysis was discussed, including the options of peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis and a low-protein diet. Since Mr. H suffered from severe arthrosis, which would have prevented self-performance, and did not receive nursing care, it was decided that peritoneal dialysis should not be undertaken. Haemodialysis was considered as a potential option that could be undertaken if absolutely necessary, and a low-protein diet was chosen as the best initial option. His diet was adapted to make up a 0.6–0.8 g/Kg/day moderately restricted, plant-based, but not fully vegan, low-protein diet that was supplemented with amino and ketoacids (1 Ketosteril pill for each 10 Kg of body weight), to avoid malnutrition. Given the low probability of creating a functioning arteriovenous fistula, the placement of a tunnelled catheter was decided on in case dialysis became necessary.
Close follow-up was started, with monthly or twice monthly controls; however, acidosis was very difficult to control and rapid unpredictable weight gain was observed, requiring frequent hospitalisation, in spite of good nutritional compliance, and good blood pressure control.
From a theoretical point of view, treatment should maximize survival and improve quality of life while the negative effects produced should be minimal. This was not fully clear in our patient and the medical and nursing staff was concerned about the clinical implications of dialysis start in a patient of Mr. H’s age; therefore there were further extensive discussions of treatment options, presented by the nurses and a psychologist. After this step, Mr. H, who had initially agreed to start dialysis was reported to refuse treatment, considering it incompatible with his daily routine. Subsequent conversations revealed that the underlying problem was missing his mid-day meal: “If I come to dialysis, I won’t be home at noon; and if I’m not home at noon, the people who deliver my meals will not find me, and if they do not deliver my meals, I won’t have anything to eat. I’m 90, I have severe arthrosis, and I’m no longer able to cook my meals myself. And I want to eat.”
Identification of the communication problem (presentation of a standard haemodialysis technique of 4 hours three times per week, instead of a tailored incremental approach) led to an empiric “narrative” compromise, with a prescription of 2.30–3.0 h of dialysis, one session per week, combined with a 30-min change in the delivery time of his meals. Mr. H felt that this arrangement was compatible with his needs.
At the time of the present report, Mr. H is alive and in good clinical condition. He is still on a once-daily schedule. Some relevant biochemical data are reported in Table . They show good overall clinical and biochemical stability, which would probably have been difficult to achieve without treatment: even if the formulae for e-GFR calculation are not precise in advanced old age, 9 mg/dL of serum creatinine corresponds to 5–6 mL/min of GFR according to the formulae employed, and the pre-dialysis level remains quite stable, thus suggesting that we were not dealing with an acute and reversible kidney injury on the basis of a chronic renal disease (Table ).
The main electrolytes are normal in the predialysis phase, except for mild acidosis (Bicarbonate between 17 and 20 mEq/L); parathyroid hormone is in the 100–300 ng/mL range and brain natriuretic peptide is between 80 and 120 pg/ml, in line with the absence of fluid overload (little need for weight loss in dialysis, on furosemide 120 mg/day). Haemoglobin has been kept on target (10–11 g/l) with recombinant erythropoietin; blood pressure has been controlled with Lercanidipine 20 mg, Nebivolol 5 mg and Urapidil 120 mg. Serum albumin is well preserved, and the patient’s “dry weight” increased after the start of dialysis. Mr. H is still on a 0.8 g of protein/Kg/day diet, supplemented with Ketosteril (1 each 10 Kg of BW).
Meanwhile, he has celebrated his ninety-first birthday. His good clinical and psychological adaptation to dialysis treatment have made the medical and nursing group confident that it will be possible to extend this option to a twice weekly schedule, with limited dialysis time (2.5–3 h) if necessary in the future.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 32.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 32.0 - 12 = 20.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 20.0 mEq/L."

In September 2008, she received a living-related donor renal transplant (HLA-A, B, DR mismatch 1-2-1) and afterwards had stable kidney function with a plasma creatinine level of 90 µmol/L and without detectable albuminuria (20 October 2009). Her native renal disease was unknown. Her hypertension was treated with a calcium channel blocker, and she had a pacemaker due to sinus node dysfunction. She received immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone 5 mg once daily, mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg twice daily and tacrolimus 3 mg once daily.
At admission, she complained of nausea and swelling of the face and lower limbs, which started after the vaccination. Plasma creatinine was elevated to 250 µmol/L. Urine dip stick showed no red blood cells, but 24-h urine collection revealed microalbuminuria of 100 mg (23 January 2010). Medical investigation included polyomavirus, ANCA (MPO and PR3), anti-GBM, ANA, anti-DNA, C3, C4, Ig-screening and CMV antigenemia—all of which were within normal limits.
Ultrasound of the graft did not reveal urinary obstruction, and there were no signs of infection. Renal biopsy showed acute cellular rejection (type IA according to the Banff classification) with severe interstitial oedema, interstitial inflammation (i2) and focal moderate tubulitis (t2). There were no signs of humoral rejection, and C4d staining was negative. Flow cytometric crossmatch was negative.
Treatment with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily was initiated. Despite 4 days of treatment, plasma creatinine was still 422 µmol/L. Chronic dialysis was initiated in November 2010.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [60, 'years'], 'creatinine': [422.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Female'}",9.818,9.327,10.309,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 60 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 422.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 422.0 µmol. To convert 422.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 422.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000422 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000422 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.048 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.048 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.048 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 48.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 48.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 4.8 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 422.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 4.8 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (4.8/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**60 * 1.012 = 9.818.
Hence, the GFR value is 9.818 ml/min/1.73 m²."
3995,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7478461-1,Extracted,"An 18-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department after he fell to the ground while climbing a 2-m fence. The weight and height of the patient was 101 kg and 1.76 m, respectively, and his body mass index (BMI) was 32.6 kg/m2. This patient was clear minded by presentation. He was unable to bear weight on his right ankle, which was in a severely malformed and swollen condition, but there appeared to be no open wound on the skin. The patient complained of pain and swelling and was unable to perform active ankle movements. Meanwhile, passive ankle movements were limited and painful. No other discomfort or past medical history was declared. A normal finding was obtained on neurovascular examination. A direct radiographic examination of the ankle showed a displaced lateral malleolar fracture with the talus wedged into the distal tibiofibular joint (Fig. A-B). An immediate manual reduction followed by fixation with plaster was performed by orthopedists (Fig. C-D). To further understand the pattern of injury, a computerized tomography (CT) examination with 3D reconstruction was performed, which demonstrated distal fibular fracture and widening of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis (Fig. E-H). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed rupture of the superior and deep deltoid ligament and the anterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) (Fig. J-L). Based on the radiological outcomes, the fracture-dislocation classification was considered as 44C1.1 (AO/OTA classification) and pronation-external rotation (Lauge-Hansen classification). Due to the extreme ankle instability caused by bone and ligament injury, surgical intervention was recommended and performed after 7 days until swelling in the foot and ankle had adequately dissipated, as indicated by a positive wrinkle test.
For the surgery, the patient was placed in a supine position under spinal anesthesia and tourniquet control. First, a curved 6 cm incision was made just below the medial malleolus and extended distally to expose the ruptured deltoid ligament and its individual components. Two suture anchors were placed at the insertion point of the deep component of the deltoid ligament of the talus, and 1 suture anchor was placed into the tip of anterior colliculus of the medial malleolus in preparation for deltoid ligament reconstruction. After that, an incision of approximately 10 cm was made on the lateral side of the fibula. Soft tissue was incised by sharp dissection to expose the broken site of the fractured fibula. Reduction of the fibula was conducted to recover the length, followed by applying a screw vertical to the fracture line for stabilization. Then, a 3.5 mm locking compression plate (LCP) was placed for neutralization. A large reduction clamp was maintained at the space of the syndesmosis and medial malleolus while the ankle joint was held in a neutral position. The mortise width and distal tibial-fibular space were restored and confirmed under C-arm fluoroscopy, and a 3.5 mm syndesmotic screw was applied. Finally, we repaired the deltoid ligaments with sutures (Fig. A-B).
Plaster was not applied after surgery. We applied early functional exercise, to include passive motion of the ankle and mobilization of the toes and knee joint 2 days postoperatively. Weight bearing was avoided. However, a radiographic examination 1 week after surgery showed that the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis was slightly wider than on intraoperative fluoroscopy, as the syndesmotic screw has a tendency to loosen (Fig. C-P). Therefore, a re-operation was conducted to deal with the syndesmosis. Using the same lateral approach as the first operation, a Weber forceps was used to reduce the gap between the tibia and fibula. Then, 2 more syndesmotic screws were inserted outside of the plate. The former syndesmotic screw was substituted with a longer one. Stability of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis was confirmed by the “HOOK” test (Fig. ).
Early passive motion of the ankle was continuously performed by a physical therapist. The radiographic examination and CT after the second operation showed a well reduced and aligned distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. Twelve weeks postoperatively, 2 syndesmotic screws were removed, and partial weightbearing was allowed with the assist of single crutch; 16 weeks postoperatively, the last syndesmotic screw was removed. Full weight bearing was allowed immediately. At 1 year after surgery, the patient was called back to the hospital for a radiographic and clinical examination. Radiographs and CT showed union of the fibular fracture; however, the syndesmotic space was slightly increased compared to the contralateral side (Fig. ). Fortunately, the patient was free of pain and returned to his previous level of daily activity; the range of motion of the injured ankle was nearly parallel with the contralateral side (Fig. ). According to American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS),[ the score was 90. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Nanjing first hospital. Signed written informed consents were obtained from the patient.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [1.76, 'm']}",71.369,67.801,74.937,"The patient's gender is Male.

Nine months prior to his admission (September 2013), he was diagnosed with effort angina and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. At the beginning of October 2013, he was found to have unprovoked PE for which he had received oral warfarin, delivering a prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 1.7 to 2.1 (reference range: 0.9-1.2) with a favorable clinical course. He had no history of renal disease, and steady serum creatinine (sCr) levels ranging between 0.96 and 1.12 mg/dL (reference range: 0.63-1.03 mg/dL) were noted until mid-December 2013. His sCr level was 1.89 mg/dL in mid-March 2014 and increased to 7.33 mg/dL in early June 2014. Therefore, he was referred and admitted to our hospital for further examination. His medical history included a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction at 58 years of age. He had been a smoker for more than 40 years but denied the use of any drugs.
At the time of admission, the patient was alert and had a temperature of 36.4°C, a heart rate of 89 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 176/94 mm Hg. His physical examination revealed livedo reticularis on the soles of his toes and a blue-purple discoloration of all toes bilaterally (), whereas his feet were warm to the touch and the peripheral pulse remained intact. Laboratory examinations revealed the following: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 64 mg/dL (reference range: 8-20 mg/dL); sCr, 7.23 mg/dL; white blood cell count, 9800/µL (reference range: 3900-9800/µL); eosinophils, 1092/µL (reference range: 0-400/µL); platelet count, 166 × 103/µL (reference range: 130-369 × 103/µL); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 59 mm/h (reference range: 0-10 mm/h); serum albumin, 3.5 g/dL (reference range: 6.9-8.4 g/dL); triglycerides, 203 mg/dL (reference range: 40-185 mg/dL); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 129 mg/dL (reference range: <139 mg/dL), fibrinogen, 410 mg/dL (reference range: 129-271 mg/dL); fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, 13.5 µg/mL (reference range: 0-5 µg/mL); D-dimer, 5900 µg/L (reference range: 0-1500 µg/L); PT-INR, 1.76; C3, 104 mg/dL (reference range: 86-160 mg/dL); C4, 45 mg/dL (reference range: 17-45 mg/dL); and C-reactive protein, 0.49 mg/dL (reference range: 0-0.14 mg/dL). Tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBsAg antibodies, and antibodies to the hepatitis C virus were all negative. His urine was trace positive for protein, 2+ for occult blood, and contained 0.09 g of protein in a 24-hour specimen, whereas his creatinine clearance was 3.9 mL/min. The urinary excretion of β2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was 22 856 µg/L (reference range: <200 µg/L) and 5.4 U/g·Cr (reference range: 0.9-2.4 U/g·Cr), respectively. A computed tomographic scan revealed a calcified thoracic aorta without a dimensional disorder and an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of approximately 4.4 cm. Diagnostic noncontrast-enhanced T2-weighted half-fourier-acquired single-shot turbo spin ecocho (HASTE) magnetic resonance imaging subsequently revealed hypointense areas and bright signals, which were suggestive of an atheromatous plaque consisting of lipids and fibrous tissues, respectively, in the abdominal aorta (). Oral warfarin was discontinued on admission, and the patient was subjected to empirical treatment with pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day combined with limaprost alfadex at a dose of 30 µg/day. A 5-mm-deep punch biopsy was performed on clinical day 7 within the territory of livedo reticularis on the lateral aspect of the left first toe. Typical biconvex needle-shaped empty spaces, suggestive of cholesterol clefts, were observed within the lumen of the arteriole in the subcutis (). A diagnosis of CES was made based on pathological and imaging findings as well as clinical manifestations.
Due to the elevated D-dimer level of 10 600 µg/L confirmed on clinical day 8, the decision was made to resume anticoagulation therapy despite our failure to detect deep venous thrombotic lesions using ultrasonography. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin and then switched to warfarin 2.5 mg/day on clinical day 30. Oral prednisolone (PSL) at a dose of 20 mg/day was also initiated on clinical day 22, resulting in the amelioration of eosinophilia and cutaneous manifestations within a few days and the subsequent stabilization of sCr levels at approximately 4.3 mg/dL. His elevated blood pressure was also controlled at approximately 120-130/70-80 mm Hg with irbesartan (100 mg/day) and amlodipine besilate (5 mg/day). However, sCr levels started to increase when PSL was tapered to 5 mg/day. The patient developed general fatigue, appetite loss, decline in urine output, and progressive swelling in both legs without any calf pain at the end of September 2014, with an elevated sCr level of 8.07 mg/dL, and was readmitted for further examinations. Similar to his initial admission, a laboratory analysis at this point revealed mild hypoalbuminemia (3.6 g/dL), whereas echocardiography and chest radiograph findings did not support the concurrent presence of heart failure. The relationship between deteriorated cutaneous manifestations and recurrent eosinophilia of 1365/µL resulted in the diagnosis of relapsed CES. The patient received hemodialysis (HD). After the resumption of an increased dose of PSL (15 mg/day) and the addition of a transient session of LDL apheresis (LDL-A) to the therapeutic regimen, his cutaneous manifestations improved and eosinophilia disappeared; however, severely deteriorated renal function did not recover, and he was finally started on a periodic HD program with favorable volume control ().","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [76, 'years'], 'creatinine': [8.07, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",6.527,6.201,6.853,"The patient is 76 years old.

Dapagliflozin was added 8 months prior to admission. He reported a weight loss of 3 Kg following the commencing of dapagliflozin, but his weight appeared stable during the last 3 months. The A1C was 7.1% one month before admission. The patient noted that he suffered from recurrent episodes of abdominal pain the last 2 months.
At presentation the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats/min, temperature 36.8°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air. The patient appeared mildly dehydrated with a BMI of 26.5 kg/m2. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness in the epigastrium and left upper quadrant. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
An arterial blood gas analysis was performed and revealed metabolic acidosis pH 7.33, HCO3− 10.9 mEq/L, and PCO2 21 mmHg with an increased anion gap at 29 mmol/L. Plasma glucose was mildly elevated at 203 mg/dL. Serum lactate was 1.1 mmol/L, i.e., within normal range.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 94.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 94.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 94.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 94.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 94.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 94.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 10.9 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (94.0 mEq/L + 10.9 mEq/L) = 29.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.1 mEq/L.
Plugging in 29.1 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 29.1 - 12 = 17.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 17.1 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 17.1 mEq/L / 13.1 mEq/L = 1.305. The patient's delta ratio is 1.305."

One glomerulus revealed fibrous crescent formation, and 11 showed segmental double contour of glomerular basement membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed slight staining for fibrinogen, but no staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, kappa light chain and lambda light chain (Fig. ). Electron microscopy showed massive granular deposits in the mesangial area and some subepithelial area (Fig. ). According to these findings, we speculated fibronectin glomerulopathy as a diagnosis. Thus, we performed immunoassays using anti-human fibronectin antibodies. The staining with IST-4, which detects plasma and cell-associated fibronectin, was positive but no staining was observed with IST-9, which stains only cell-associated fibronectin (Fig. ). The mesangial deposits were therefore shown to comprise plasma fibronectin. The patient was finally diagnosed as fibronectin glomerulopathy.
Her family history was investigated further. Although her mother and younger sister had previously been detected to have proteinuria, their urine and blood tests were normal. Her father showed no urinary abnormalities and normal kidney function at his annual health examination. Given that no family history of renal disease could be identified, the current case was determined to be sporadic. The patient and her mother underwent genetic testing of the FN1 gene, which revealed no abnormalities.
Treatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and a sodium-restricted diet were started. However, 10 months after the kidney biopsy, the patient’s proteinuria had increased and her renal function was deteriorated, with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 9.52 g/gCr, serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL. Her serum albumin decreased to 2.0 g/dL.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [21, 'years'], 'weight': [53.0, 'kg'], 'height': [158.6, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.73, 'mg/dL']}",98.367,93.449,103.285,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 21 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.73 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 158.6 cm, which is 158.6 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.586 m. The patient's weight is 53.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 53.0 kg / (1.586 m * 1.586 m) = 21.07 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 21.1, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 51.114 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 21) * 51.114 * 0.85) / (0.73 * 72) = 98.367 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 98.367 mL/min."
6841,51,SIRS Criteria,diagnosis,integer,pmc-7189307-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old male presented to the emergency department with four days of sore throat, odynophagia, and productive cough with clear-white, blood-tinged sputum. He also noted unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past three months but denied dyspnea, night sweats, fever, chills, or prior pulmonary complaints. Additional complaints included nausea, vomiting, polydipsia, and polyuria for the past few days after he stopped taking his long-acting insulin to adjust for decreased oral intake. He was sent to the emergency department by his primary care physician for abnormalities on chest X-ray taken the previous day, at which time he had been prescribed cephalexin empirically for suspected community acquired pneumonia.
His past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and long-acting insulin without previous hospitalizations. He immigrated to the United States approximately 40 years ago from Central America and had never left the United States since. He works as short-distance truck driver and previously smoked heavily for a decade before quitting 20 years ago.
Upon arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs included blood pressure 123/90 mmHg, heart rate 134 beats per minute, respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, temperature 97.8°F, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. His physical exam revealed a cachectic man in mild distress with tachypnea, without nasal flaring or retractions, with dry mucous membranes, and hoarse voice. Lung auscultation revealed diffuse bilateral crackles. Cardiac exam revealed tachycardia with regular rhythm. Abdominal exam did not demonstrate hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. There were no other significant physical findings on examination.
His chest X-ray revealed diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities and airspace disease with a possible lingular cavitary lesion (). A thoracic CT without contrast was obtained which revealed numerous, bilateral tiny nodular densities, most prominently in the upper lobes, and confirmed the lingular cavitary lesion (). A few scattered mediastinal lymph nodes were also noted. Serum chemistry was remarkable for an anion gap of 35, beta-hydroxybutyrate of 8.09 mmol/L, and blood glucose of 532 mg/dL. Hematology showed a white blood cell count of 13 000/μL with 0% eosinophils. Venous blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 32, and lactic acid of 5.46 mmol/L. Urinalysis was positive for 4+ glucose and 3+ acetone. Later, HIV antigen testing for types 1 and 2 was negative and CD4 count was 343 cells/μL. Vancomycin 1 g and piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g were given intravenously in the emergency department. Intravenous insulin was started with dose adjustment according to an in-house nursing algorithm alongside vigorous hydration.
He was admitted to the ICU on airborne isolation with differential diagnoses including coccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis, complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis. In the ICU, empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole 800 mg/day was started intravenously for suspected pulmonary Coccidioides infection. Although serum anion gap and bicarbonate normalized on day two, he remained tachycardic and tachypneic and required supplemental oxygen. He also continued to have odynophagia that necessitated enteral tube feeding until hospital day five, when he was finally able to tolerate an oral diet. At this point, he developed a mild elevation of transaminases and fluconazole was changed to itraconazole 200 mg twice daily due to concern for hepatotoxicity, and abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) were obtained to rule out hepatic involvement from the suspected fungal infection. Both of these studies were negative for ascites, focal hypoattenuation within the liver, or hepatic or splenic enlargement. The CT additionally did not demonstrate abdominal adenopathy. Aminotransferases trended from their peak on hospital day three to normal on day eight.
A week after admission, he remained tachypneic, hypoxic, and hoarse. Three sputum samples were negative for acid-fast bacilli but Coccidioides antibody titer and complement fixation had not yet resulted; thus, bronchoscopy was performed, revealing irregular-appearing borders of false and true vocal cords with erythema and edema, two vocal cord polyps, inflamed upper trachea in the subglottic space, and several flesh-colored endobronchial lesions bilaterally. Forceps biopsies and brushings were performed on the endobronchial lesions, true and false cords, and posterior trachea just below the larynx. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in the right middle lobe and lingula. BAL fluid cell count and differential showed a neutrophilic predominance with spherules and endospores, consistent with Coccidioides immitis or Rhinosporidium seeberi. The biopsy specimens demonstrated the same pathogen in the laryngeal tissue. The culture of the BAL fluid eventually grew Coccidioides immitis on the day prior to discharge (day 14), but the laryngeal tissue was not cultured.
Otolaryngology consultant recommended outpatient follow-up with consideration for laryngoscopy after resolution of his acute illness. Two days after bronchoscopy, Coccidioides antibody titer returned positive at 1 : 16. The infectious disease consultant recommended continuing itraconazole for a minimum of 12 months with serial monitoring of Coccidioides titer, transaminases, and itraconazole level every three months. He continually improved on antifungal therapy until successfully weaning from supplemental oxygen and discharge after two weeks of hospitalization.
Coccidioides complement fixation returned strongly positive at 1 : 1024 nine days after discharge. Histoplasma urine antigen was positive but below the limit of quantification. At his follow-up appointments two and twelve weeks after discharge, his productive cough was present but improved and his hoarseness, dyspnea, and odynophagia had resolved. His liver enzymes remain within normal limits.

The patient's temperature is 97.8 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 65.8 = 36.556 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 134.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 13000.0 count/µL. To convert 13000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 13000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 13000000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 40.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 32.0 mm Hg, At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.

3149,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-5165135-1,Extracted,"A 65-year-old man with a remote history of possible PE and current tobacco use presented with swelling, erythema, and warmth of his right lower extremity for three to four weeks (). He denied cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, chest pain, recent travel, prolonged immobilization, or history of malignancy. Approximately ten years ago he was diagnosed with a PE at an unrecallable hospital and did not receive anticoagulation. The events surrounding this self-reported PE could not be verified.
Five weeks before presentation, the patient went to the Emergency Department with low back and right buttock pain radiating down to the mid-posterior right calf and was diagnosed with sciatica. Two weeks later, he returned with pleuritic chest pain and exertional dyspnea, thought to be secondary to costochondritis; he left against medical advice. Three weeks later, on the day of admission, he was evaluated by his primary care physician, who obtained a lower extremity venous Doppler study that showed extensive DVT in his right lower extremity ().
The patient's medications included bupropion, cholecalciferol, ibuprofen, prazosin, simvastatin, vitamin A, and over-the-counter supplements including DIM. He had used over-the-counter testosterone supplements for six months but discontinued them 13 months before hospitalization. Prior to his hospitalization, he used DIM one tablet daily for three to four months. He did not know the dose, but a common dose is 100 mg per tablet. He had a 60 pack-year smoking history, with cessation for five years prior to resumption one year ago. He had a documented weight loss of 7 kg over one month, but he endorsed a recent increase in exercise, including skiing and weight lifting. Colonoscopy four months earlier found a benign polyp. Prostate specific antigen was less than 3 ng/mL a year before and during hospitalization.
Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 123/81 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 36.1°C, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The right leg was mildly swollen with erythema and warmth. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Chemistry panel, complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and coagulation studies were normal. PE-protocol computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figures and ) showed bilateral pulmonary artery filling defects with marked involvement of the right middle lobe branch with associated probable infarction. He was treated with anticoagulation and counseled on tobacco dependence.

The patient's heart rate is 104.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 6 + 1.5 = 7.5.
Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 7.5.
Because the patient has previously been diagnosed for pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 7.5 + 1.5 = 9.0.
Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 9.0.

30,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-8443410-1,Extracted,"A 66-year-old man (body height, 168 cm; body weight, 88.5 kg) experienced dyspnea, a sensation of chest tightness, and back pain for a few days before he was brought to our hospital on an emergency basis. His symptoms became aggravated suddenly as he was about to get off a taxi on his way home from work. He presented with a history of close contact with a coworker with COVID-19 and was waiting for instructions from a public health center.
In the ambulance, the following conditions were documented: Glasgow Coma Scale score, E4V5M6; heart rate, 80/min and irregular; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; body temperature, 38.4ºC; oxygen saturation, 98% (O2 delivered with reservoir mask at a rate of 15 L/min). On admission, his white blood cell count was 22,300/µL; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 35 × 104/µL; creatinine level, 2.23 mg/dL; creatine kinase level, 2582 IU/L; creatine kinase myocardial band level, 164 ng/mL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 97 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level, 19 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 173 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9%; C-reactive protein level, 13.8 mg/dL; troponin T level, 9.640 ng/mL; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, 11753 pg/mL; procalcitonin level, 0.62 ng/mL; d-dimer level, 16.34 µg/mL; and soluble fibrin level, 113.1 µg/mL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation; ST-elevation in II, III, aVF, and V2–V6 leads; and ST depression in aVR leads (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesis extending from the anterior wall to the apex and the inferior wall in left ventricle, with an approximate ejection fraction of 20%. We diagnosed STEMI and decided to perform emergency coronary angiography (CAG). A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows in both lungs and tracheal intubation was performed in the emergency outpatient unit (Figure ). Continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 μg/kg/min) was started because his systolic blood pressure dropped below 80 mmHg. After heparin (5,000 U) was administered intravenously, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room.
CAG was performed by cardiologists, emergency physicians, clinical engineers, nurses, and radiological technologists who donned appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the room. CAG revealed total occlusion of the middle of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure ). After a loading dose of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 162 mg; clopidogrel, 300 mg), an intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was inserted, and a 7-Fr guiding catheter was inserted into the left coronary artery. We removed white material, which did not at a first glance appear to be a typical thrombus, with an aspiration catheter, but blood flow did not improve. The onset-to-device time and door-to-device time were 116 and 84 minutes, respectively. Subsequent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) revealed several structures, which were thought to be thrombi; therefore, we performed plain old balloon angioplasty (Figure ). After the balloon was expanded, blood flow improved slightly in the LAD but not distally. Next, we placed an everolimus-eluting stent (4.0 × 38 mm) in the middle of the LAD, but peripheral blood flow was still not observed. Repeated IVUS revealed severe stenosis caused by plaque with thrombi. An additional balloon was inflated at the distal site, and a cutting balloon was also used. Another everolimus-eluting stent (2.25 × 38 mm) was placed at the distal site, but no blood flow improvements were seen angiographically.
We moved a double-lumen catheter to the distal LAD and performed CAG from the distal LAD, which revealed retrograde blood flow up to the middle of the LAD and collateral circulation from the septal branch to the RCA. Repeated IVUS examination revealed thrombi and plaque at the distal end of the stent and no intrastent blood flow (Figure ). Then, we tried to perform PCI for the total occlusion of RCA, but it was unsuccessful. At this point, 7 hours passed since the patient entered the cardiac catheterization room, and so we finished the procedure. The levels of activated clotting time during PCI were maintained at 280–310 seconds. After PCI, pathological examination proved the aspirated white material was white thrombi. Chest computed tomography performed after PCI showed ground-glass opacities distributed unevenly in both the lungs, as well as left-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he showed pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with 1 mg of epinephrine and one cycle of CPR. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was considered, but his family decided against it. The blood pressure was maintained through the continuous administration of noradrenaline, dobutamine, and adrenaline. His nasopharyngeal swab was tested with polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19-related pneumonia was diagnosed. Remdesivir treatment was initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day on the 5th day of hospitalization and continued at 100 mg/day. Because of the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium (9 g/day) was also administered. However, the patient's oxygenation level worsened, and he died on the 7th day. It was difficult to confirm a main cause of death because we were not permitted to dissect patients due to COVID-19. We assumed that he had died from both cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction and septic shock due to covid-19 infection.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 66 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 2.23 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 88.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 88.5 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 31.356 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 31.4, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 66.142 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (66.142 (in inches) - 60) = 64.127 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 64.127 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 64.127 kg + 0.4 * (88.5 kg  - 64.127 kg) = 73.876 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 73.876 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 73.876 * 1) / (2.23 * 72) = 34.048 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 34.048 mL/min."

She was born at term with a birth weight of 2900 g [-0.96 standard deviation (SD)]. The parents reported that she began to gain weight rapidly at 1.5 years of age. There was no consanguinity between the parents. The patient had two healthy siblings (of ages 11 years and 9 months). Body weight was 61 kg (±3.9 SD) and height was 130 cm (±1.8 SD) with a body mass index (BMI) of 36 kg/m2 (±3.3 SD). She had a plethoric facial appearance, axillary acanthosis nigricans, pale/blue fingers and toes and stage 2 thelarche, bilaterally. The patient was admitted to hospital for further evaluation. During follow-up, it was observed that she had episodes of excessive sweating and a body temperature as low as 35.4 °C. Blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg (95 percentile: 120/80 mm/Hg). Laboratory evaluation showed the following results: sodium (Na), 156 mmol/L [normal range (NR): 135-145 mmol/L]; aspartate transaminase, 87 U/L (NR: 8-45 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 57 U/L (NR: 7-55 U/L); urine density, 1024. The remaining liver function tests, serum electrolytes, lipids kidney function tests and complete blood count were normal. The patient had no polydipsia; thus, hypernatremia was considered to be due to insufficient intake. Oral fluid replacement was given and the hypernatremia was corrected (Na: 141 mmol/L). Impaired glucose tolerance (141 mg/dL at two hours) was detected in the oral glucose tolerance test performed due to morbid obesity and acanthosis nigricans; and the patient was started on metformin. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, due to the elevated transaminase levels, which revealed grade 3 hepatic steatosis.
In terms of hormonal problems that may present in the patient’s follow-up hormonal evaluation revealed the following results: free T4, 0.7 ng/mL (NR: 0.98-1.6 ng/mL; thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 4.8 µIU/mL (NR: 0.5-4.3 µIU/mL); adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 24 pg/mL (NR: 10-60 pg/mL); cortisol, 1.5 µg/mL (NR: 3-21 µg/mL); LH, 1.3 mIU/mL (prepubertal NR: <0.3 mIU/mL); estradiol, 12.9 pg/mL (prepubertal NR: <12 pg/mL); prolactin (PRL), 33 ng/mL (NR: 4.7-23.3 ng/mL). Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was <25 ng/mL and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) 1870 ng/mL. Bone age was advanced at 10 years. Peak cortisol response to low dose ACTH stimulation test was low (9.9 µg/mL).
A diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency, central hypothyroidism and central precocious puberty was made and treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, thyroxine and leuprolide acetate. No further evaluation or treatment was considered for GH deficiency, due to the patient’s normal height. However, a predisposition to neural crest tumor was considered despite the low IGF-1 and IGFBP3 levels of the patient. Brain and pituitary magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were found to be normal. The IQ score was 65. The pale appearance of the fingers was considered to be due to Raynaud’s phenomenon ().

The concentration of sodium is 156.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 156.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 156.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 156.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 156.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 156.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 141.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 156.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (141.0 - 100) = 156.984 mEq/L.

Shortly after, the patient began feeling dizzy and started to vomit and ultimately presented to the hospital with severe fatigue, lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She last took metformin (she was on a 750 mg twice daily home dose) on the morning of her presentation to the hospital and admitted to taking exogenous ketone supplements containing 30 g of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) three times a day.
On evaluation, she was hemodynamically stable with baseline normal mental function but appeared dehydrated. Assessment of vitals showed the patient was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute and borderline tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Her electrocardiogram did not show any arrhythmias or concerning changes in ST segments. On examination, she had dry mucous membranes and diffuse lower abdominal pain to palpation without guarding or rebound tenderness. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell count of 30,100/mm3 (normal range: 4,500-11,000/mm3), creatinine 1.47 mg/dL (0.60-1.30 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen 32 mg/dL (7-18 mg/dL), glucose 176 mg/dL (74-106 mg/dL), serum bicarbonate 8 mEq/L (21-32 mEq/L), anion gap 27.7 mEq/L (3-15 mEq/L), and a serum lactic acid of 2.9 mmol/L (0.4-2.0 mmol/L). The patient also had a moderately positive serum qualitative acetone level, plasma osmolality 312 mOsm/kg (275-301 mOsm/Kg), sodium 136 mEq/L (136-145 moml/L), and HbA1C of 8.4% (<5.7%). A urinalysis showed elevated urine ketones and was negative for glucose. Her pH from a venous blood gas analysis on admission was 6.81.
Differential diagnoses of diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and salicylate toxicity were investigated. Serum and urine drug screens were negative for ethanol, acetaminophen, and salicylates. The patient was started on intravenous fluids with dextrose 5%-0.9% normal saline, sliding scale insulin, and 50 meq sodium bicarbonate 8.4%. After two days in the intensive care unit, the patient clinically felt much better. Her anion gap closed and her pH on a venous blood gas analysis was 7.38. The patient was transferred to the floors and was discharged the following day.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [176.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [136.0, 'mEq/L']}",137.824,130.933,144.715,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.

He described the pain as increasing progressively in intensity, worsening after meals, and accompanied by nausea. He also suffered from diarrhea twice. He was diagnosed with Graves' disease 2 weeks ago, and was being treated with MMI (20 mg per day). His other medications included bisoprolol and 100 mg aspirin for atrial fibrillation. He did not have any history of drug or food allergies. He denied the use of tobacco, alcohol, and any dietary supplements. His family history was unremarkable, and did not include thyroid disease or gastrointestinal disorders.
Upon admission, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, heart rate of 121 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 21 times per minute, and a body temperature of 39.0℃. He had a slightly enlarged thyroid gland, but there was no pharyngeal injection. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric and upper abdomen without rebound tenderness, guarding, or rigidity.
The results of blood tests were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,460/µL, hemoglobin of 16.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 103,000/µL. Biochemical parameters were glucose of 222 mg/dL, triglycerides of 113 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 30.3 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.45 mg/dL, sodium of 133.8 mM/L, potassium of 3.9 mM/L, chloride of 97.3 mM/L, aspartate transaminase of 34 IU/L, alanine transaminase of 46 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase of 46 U/L, total bilirubin of 2.60 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 46.7 mg/L, amylase of 86 IU/L (normal range: 29-110), and lipase of 86 IU/L (normal range: 14-60).
A thyroid function test at the first visit revealed TSH of 0.01 mIU/L (normal range: 0.27-4.20), free T4 of 3.89 ng/dL (normal range: 0.93-1.70), total T3 of 199.8 ng/dL (normal range: 80-200), anti-TPO antibody of 17.84 (normal range: 0-34), and TSH-receptor antibody of 8.8 IU/L (normal range: 0.00-1.75). In Tc-99m thyroid scan, the uptake ratio was 4.8%. There was no elevation of serum antibodies for respiratory viruses including adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and rhinovirus. He also tested negative for serum antibodies against tsutsugamushi, leptospira, and hantavirus.
The following day, MMI therapy was restarted after holding 42 hr because his fever had subsided and there was no evidence of agranulocytosis. However, 5 hr after he took the second dose of MMI (10 mg), abdominal pain and fever (39.2℃) developed again. At that time, laboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 5,580/µL (72.7% neutrophils and 1.9% eosinophils), total bilirubin of 1.84 mg/dL, and CRP of 26.0 mg/L. His serum amylase and lipase levels increased to 265 IU/L and 682 IU/L, respectively. Electrophoresis revealed that his pancreatic amylase isoenzyme levels were elevated. An abdominal CT revealed a swollen pancreas with peripancreatic inflammatory fat stranding, suggestive of acute pancreatitis (). An abdominal ultrasound was then performed, which showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or biliary duct dilatation ().
After the withdrawal of MMI, his fever and abdominal pain improved, and pancreatic enzyme levels began to decrease and finally normalized (). We measured IgG and IgG4 to exclude autoimmune pancreatitis. The serum levels of IgG and IgG subclass-4 were in the normal range (901.5 mg/dL, normal range: 700-1,600; and 349 mg/L, normal range: 30-2,010, respectively). The serologic typing of HLA alleles revealed DRB1*0803 and DQB1*0601.

The concentration of sodium is 133.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.8 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.8 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.8 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.8 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 222.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 133.8 mEq/L + 0.024 * (222.0 - 100) = 136.728 mEq/L.

2914,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-4316229-1,Extracted,"A 39-year-old male office worker without a previous history of specific diseases and symptoms underwent a scheduled colonoscopy as part of a medical check-up. The patient underwent colonoscopy in another institute 3 years ago, and did not experience any specific symptoms from the use of sodium phosphate bowel purgative (Solin oral solution, Korea Pharma Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea) as a colonic cleansing agent. Other examinations also indicated no abnormal findings.
One day prior to the colonoscopy, the patient received a dose of PEG agent (Colyte powder, Taejoon Pharma Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea). About 5 minutes later, he experienced a generalized rash, itching, swelling and tingling feeling in his arms, dizziness, dysphagia, and dyspnea, and therefore, he visited our emergency room (ER). The patient did not have a history of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, and hepatitis), or any allergic disorders such as bronchial asthma and food allergies. He had been smoking for over 10 years and drinking at least once per week. In addition, no specific family history was noted, including any known occurrence of CRC.
Within 30 min, the patient was transferred to the ER by ambulance. When admitted to the ER, he was in a state of shock, with a blood pressure of 41/31 mmHg, heart rate of 102 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.0℃. Even though the patient showed acute symptoms, he was still conscious. No specific findings were noted on chest and abdominal examinations. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Blood tests revealed leukocytes, hemoglobin, and platelet levels of 6,700/mm3 (92.9% neutrophils, and 0.0% eosinophils), 15.5 g/dL, and 238,000/mm3, respectively, which were all within normal ranges. Electrolyte tests showed that sodium, potassium, and chloride levels were 141 mEq/L, 3.1 mEq/L, and 106 mEq/L, respectively.
Other results on biochemical and urine analyses were found to be within normal ranges. In arterial blood gas analysis, levels of pH, pCO2, pO2, and bicarbonate were 7.427, 35.2 mmHg, 84.0 mmHg, and 23.2 mEq/L, respectively. Cardiac enzyme tests revealed a CK-MB level of 0.7 ng/mL and a Troponin I level of 0.012 ng/mL, both of which were within normal ranges. The heart rate was found to be 82 regular sinus rhythms per minute on electrocardiography, and no significant findings were revealed on chest and abdominal radiography. The patient was interviewed completely and thoroughly several times regarding food allergens, medications, exercise, and occupational exposure to hazardous substances that can cause anaphylaxis. However, no cause other than the administration of the PEG agent could be identified.
As anaphylactic shock by PEG was suspected, oxygen was supplied via a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 L/min. Although the patient was administered with 1 L of saline as well as an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg of epinephrine (epinephrine injection solution, Daihan Pharm Co., Seoul, Korea), 3 mg of piprinhydrinate (Plakon®, Yungjin Pharm Co., Seoul, Korea), and 125 mg of methylprednisolone (Salon®, Hanlim Pharm Co., Seoul, Korea), his hypotension was not alleviated after 10 minutes. Therefore, 1 mg of epinephrine was dissolved in 0.5 L of glucose injection solution (5%) and then injected with the constant rate of 1 µg/min. Most symptoms (e.g., difficulty in breathing, hives, itching, and other symptoms) improved 1 hour after treatment, and vital signs returned to normal (blood pressure, 120/78 mmHg; heart rate, 92 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min). The continuous injection of epinephrine and oxygen supply were subsequently discontinued. In order to confirm whether the PEG agent was responsible for the anaphylaxis, a skin prick test was planned but not performed because the patient firmly refused to undergo the test owing to a fear of experiencing another anaphylactic shock.
Three hours after admission to the ER, the patient only showed edema on both arms, but all other symptoms were attenuated or they disappeared. After 20 hours, his vital signs were stable and no further evidence of exacerbation and recurrence were noted. The patient was informed about the possibility of anaphylaxis caused by the PEG agent, and advised to avoid such substances in the future.

He was known to have poorly controlled diabetes, and hyperlipidemia on treatment; he was also a heavy smoker for more than 20 years. The complaints started 3 weeks prior to presentation with fever and gluteal abscess which was drained surgically (). The fever persisted despite receiving a combination of gentamycin and penicillin. Two days later, the patient’s condition deteriorated with the onset of shortness of breath and orthopnea. Two sets of blood culture performed on 6 August 2017 grew CoNS, which was considered a contaminant. Further evaluation via transthoracic echocardiography revealed the presence of large vegetation on the aortic valve with severe regurgitation and moderate size vegetation on mitral and tricuspid valve with moderate regurgitation plus aortic root abscess. He was subsequently transferred to our hospital for cardiac surgery.
On arrival, his condition had worsened as evidenced by fever with a temperature of 38.9°C, tachycardia (142 beats/minute), hypotension (96/54 mm Hg), and blood oxygen saturation level of 91%. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 14,000/mm3 with 81% neutrophils while kidney profile showed acute renal failure with urea 19.5 mmol/L and creatinine 533 µmol/L. His C-reactive protein level was 200 mg/L.
He was admitted to the intensive care unit and parenteral vancomycin was initiated based on the knowledge of a previous culture of CoNS from the referring hospital. The condition of the patient deteriorated further the next day with refractory heart failure and pulmonary edema due to the extensive valvular lesions and insufficiency with worse blood gas values and desaturation (SpO2, 84%). He was intubated and continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated with a good response as demonstrated by the normalization of his blood pressure and blood gases.
The microbiologist in our hospital issued the result of the positive blood culture of CoNS, which was identified as S. lugdunensis by using MicroScan Walkaway 96 Plus commercial system. The decision to add cefazolin was based on the antibiogram which showed the isolate to be sensitive to almost all antibiotics tested including oxacillin. A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a large vegetation on the aortic valve with regurgitation and moderate vegetations on the mitral and tricuspid valves with regurgitation and aortic root abscess (Figures ). The general condition worsened with refractory heart failure and pulmonary edema due to the extensive valvular lesions and insufficiency.
An emergency open heart surgery was then performed to replace all valves and drain the aortic root abscess. His postoperative clinical course was uneventful with vancomycin and cefazolin as a combination of antibiotics administered over a period of 6 weeks. He was subsequently discharged in a stable condition ().","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [43, 'years'], 'creatinine': [533.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Male'}",11.155,10.597,11.713,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 43 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 533.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 533.0 µmol. To convert 533.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 533.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000533 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000533 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.06 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.06 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.06 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 60.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 60.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 6.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 533.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 6.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (6.0/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**43 * 1.0 = 11.155.
Hence, the GFR value is 11.155 ml/min/1.73 m²."
7582,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-6321693-1,Extracted,"A 63-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our department because of an abnormal shadow at the left side of her chest wall on computed tomography. She had undergone total hysterectomy and radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma 4 years prior. One year after the first surgery, three metastatic lung nodules appeared at the upper lobe of her right lung, the lower lobe of her right lung, and the lower lobe of her left lung. Wedge resection for upper and lower lobe of her right lung was initially performed via three-port thoracoscopic surgery. Then, wedge resection for the lower lobe of her left lung was performed via eighth intercostal single incisional thoracoscopic surgery. After the surgery, an intrathoracic chest wall mass developed which increased in size gradually. Her gynecologist introduced her to our department for surgical resection of the mass. Her family, including her parents and two sisters, had been healthy and had no inheritable diseases. She had no symptom, drug history, tobacco smoking history, or psychosocial history, and she was a social drinker. She had not received any medications since the mass developed and until admission to our hospital. She had undergone an operation three times as mentioned above and had been a carrier of type B hepatitis.
After her admission to our department, her general condition was good, and there were three operative scars at both sides of her chest and lower abdomen. Her chest sounds were clear and there was no neurological abnormality. She was 151.1 centimeters tall and weighed 49.8 kilograms. Her heart rate was 77/minute, blood pressure was 135/87 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.1 °C. The laboratory findings were white blood cells 5.25 × 103/μL, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, and platelets 156 × 103/μL. A liver function test revealed: albumin 4.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 15 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 13 U/L, and total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dL. A renal function test revealed blood urea nitrogen 13.6 mg/dL and creatinine 0.79 mg/dL. An electrolyte test revealed sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, and chlorine 106 mEq/L. A tumor marker test revealed carcinoembryonic antigen 3.4 ng/mL and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 0.80 ng/mL. Another test revealed positive reaction to type B hepatitis surface antigen and C-reactive protein < 0.1 mg/dL. Computed tomography demonstrated a gradually increasing low-density mass measuring 2.0 × 1.8 cm in diameter (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a low-intensity mass in T1-weighted imaging and a high-intensity mass in T2-weighted imaging (Fig. ). The mass was thought to be a singular cyst; however, this type of cyst was rare and the mass was increasing. Therefore, dissemination of cervical carcinoma could not be excluded, and surgical removal of a part or tissue of the mass was performed.
In the right lateral position, thoracoscopic excision of the mass was done with two ports (3 mm and 2 cm access ports) by two general thoracic surgeons (Fig. ). First the 3 mm port was set at the sixth intercostal space on the inframammary line. Most of her left lung was attached to her chest wall; therefore, the second port was set above the cyst and lysis of adhesions was done. After the lysis, the cystic mass was found adhering to the upper lobe of her left lung. The adhesion of the mass to her lung was not strong and could be separated without injury to the visceral pleura. Therefore, the mass was thought to derive from the chest wall pleura and was resected by adhesiolysis.
The mass was a unilocular cyst containing mucinous fluid. On microscopic examination, the cyst was lined with a single layer of cuboidal epithelium (Fig. ); immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of calretinin and D2-40 (Fig. ). Thus, the cyst was diagnosed as mesothelial cyst derived from the chest wall pleura. Five years after the surgery, our patient had no evidence of cyst or cervical carcinoma on computed tomography.",What is the patient's body surface area?

After admission, his chest pain persisted, and the serum troponin I level and ECG were checked repeatedly. Although his serial ECG did not show no significant changes (), his serum troponin I level 3 h after the admission was elevated to 0.90 ng/mL. Furthermore, reconstruction of the SDCT (IQon Spectral CT; Philips healthcare) images clearly showed a perfusion defect of the posterolateral left ventricle myocardium (), suggesting a combination of PE and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
Following these findings, coronary angiogram was then performed which showed total occlusion of the OM branch. Although atherosclerotic plaques were seen in multiple coronary arteries, significant stenosis was not observed except for the OM branch (). Consequently, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to the occlusion site. After thrombectomy, intracoronary imaging using intravascular ultrasound was performed, and atherosclerotic plaque lesions were observed (). Two drug-eluting stents were deployed (Synergy 2.75/28 mm and Synergy 2.25/20 mm), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow was achieved (). The creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB peaked at 2034 and 278 IU/L (normal values: CK 60–287 IU/L and CK-MB <25 IU/L) 8 h after the admission.
Following treatment of ACS, we began treatment for PE with an oral anticoagulant (OAC, rivaroxaban 30 mg/day). He was relieved of his chest symptoms and was rescued from a hypoxic state. He was discharged on the 14th day after admission. Enhanced SDCT and associated reconstructed images of effective atomic number (Z-effective) 6 months after the treatment started, until when dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC therapy (rivaroxaban 30 mg/day for 3 weeks and 15 mg/day after 3 weeks) were continued, showed improvement in perfusion defects in both pulmonary fields () and the myocardium (). His treatment was deescalated to single antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC, and he has had a good course without recurrence.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [36.2, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [72.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [24.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [12900.0, 'µL']}",3,3,3,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 36.2 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 72.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 12900.0 count/µL. To convert 12900.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 12900.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 12900000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 24.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.

At first preanesthetic check-up (PAC) visit he was found to be a known case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on derriphyline and inhalers of budesonide and ipatropium bromide. Patient was also chronic smoker since 20 years. He was having bilateral basal coarse crepitations for which advised incentive spirometry, steam inhalation and prescribed antibiotics and nebulization with bronchodilator. He was examined to rule out cardiac dysautonomia (by normal 2D-Echo, Valsalva response, ECG changes to respiration and blood pressure changes related to posture and hyperventilation, all were within normal limits) and respiratory dysautonomia [by breath holding time 30 sec, pulmonary function test (PFT); values was showing obstructive pattern and sleep study were acceptable as per age]. Rest of his general examination and biochemical (liver and kidney functions test) investigations were within normal limits. On PAC review patient clinically improved and chest X-ray and PFT were acceptable. On night before surgery patient was given tablet rantidine 150 mg and lorazepam 1 mg perorally and advised to continue with respiratory medications.
In operation theatre monitoring was applied and large bore IV line was secured after local anesthetic application. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 150 mg after midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 120 mcg and was intubated with size 8.5 cuffed endotracheal tube after administration of muscle relaxant; atracurium 50 mg. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air (50:50) with sevoflurane, fentanyl, atracurium and propofol infusion.

The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mEq. To convert from 140.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 30.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 120.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 140.0 + (30.0 / 2.8) + (30.0 / 18) = 297.381 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 297.381 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 297.381 mOsm/kg."

His medical history was remarkable for grade IV chronic kidney disease secondary to genitourinary malformation and under treatment with hemodialysis. He developed secondary hypertension, which was managed with oral antihypertensive drugs.
His VA was ‘hand motions’ in both eyes. The anterior segment examination revealed bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage with no signs of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination evidenced serous retinal detachment with macular involvement (fig. ). No retinal tears were observed in the peripheral retina examination with scleral depression. However, curvilinear whitish lesions scattered throughout the peripheral retina were observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans confirmed the presence of subretinal fluid in the macular region (fig. ).
The patient was uncompliant to oral antihypertensive therapy and dialysis treatment. His blood pressure measured 180/110 mm Hg. A systemic workup was conducted with the only relevant finding of a significantly increased creatinine value (17 mg/dl). Oral antihypertensive therapy and dialysis were initiated in order to control the kidney failure and the arterial hypertension.
One week later, his VA improved to 0.3 in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated a significant regression of the retinal detachment. After 2 weeks, his VA improved to 0.5 in both eyes, showing a subcomplete resolution of the exudative detachment in his right eye and a persistence of subretinal fluid in the macula and the inferior retina in his left eye (fig. ).
As the retina reattached, splinter hemorrhages and retinal vascular tortuosity were observed, thus supporting the hypertensive origin of the retinopathy. Likewise, the whitish areas remained unchanged (fig. ), especially in the retinal periphery. We assume that this might be secondary to ischemia of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid. A longer follow-up could not be performed because the patient did not show up for his scheduled visits.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [26, 'years'], 'creatinine': [17.0, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",3.434,3.262,3.606,"The patient is 26 years old.

The electrocardiogram recorded sinus rhythm at 63/min with negative T waves at V1 and V2 leads. The echocardiography showed a moderate left ventricle dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction 45%) with severe apical and anterior wall hypokinesia.
The patient was referred to our Cath lab after receiving Aspirin 250 mg IV, oral Ticagrelor 180 mg, and Fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneous. Coronary angiography showed a long (22 mm) moderate smooth stenosis (50%) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) (). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis highlighted an intramural coronary haematoma starting at the ostium of the artery to its middle part without a dissection plane visualized ().
The patient was admitted to our intensive cardiac care unit for monitoring. She has been treated with aspirin 75 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg orally. She was asymptomatic with no signs of haemodynamic instability and normal clinical examination. Five days later, she presented several recurrences of chest pain with good response to nitroglycerine administration associated to an increased level of troponin; average blood pressure was 125/85 mmHg. The angiogram control revealed a significant worsening of the stenosis with an extension of the wall haematoma towards the middle part of the LAD () with normal run flow (TIMI 3).
After heart-team discussion, a conservative strategy was decided upon with hospital monitoring and medical treatment with aspirin, beta-blockers, and nitrates. Chest pain totally disappeared without recurrences. Angiogram control at 2 weeks () showed an extension of the haematoma to the distal LAD.
In the following days, the patient remained totally asymptomatic and was then discharged with the same treatment. Strict rest was also suggested.
The patient has been consulting in our centre once a week for 3 months.
After 3 months, she was totally asymptomatic. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed limited apical myocardial late gadolinium enhancement with normal left ventricle ejection fraction. Coronary angiogram showed a quite normal appearance of the LAD (). Optical coherence tomography control showed a significant regression of the LAD wall haematoma with dispersed, vanishing haematoma remnants ().
At 1 year, she remained asymptomatic and her echocardiography showed persistent limited apical akinesia with normal left ventricular function.

The following month, he was cited for a control, where 21 episodes were quantified with the clinical characteristics described above but without a predominant laterality; no triggering or attenuating factors were identified. A simple and contrasted cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which showed no alterations of any kind. Based on the characteristics of the episodes, the clinical course and the results of the MRI, he was diagnosed with PSH, so a therapeutic test was prescribed with Coenzyme Q10, in a dose of one 100-mg tablet given orally every 12 hours as a prophylactic treatment, and the diary registry of headaches continued.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 25.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.

Other medical history included hypertension of unknown duration that was being treated with amlodipine besylate, losartan, and carvedilol. There was no prior history of seizures, neurological symptoms, loss of vision or other underlying illnesses, or use of any other drugs. Upon arrival at our outpatient department, the patient had severe dyspnea.
On admission (day 0), the patient had mild confusion and anasarca. His height was 168 cm; body weight, 74 kg; blood pressure, 124/43 mmHg; and body temperature, 35.7°C. Urinalysis showed 1+ proteinuria and 2+ occult blood, − glucose, and − ketone and urinary sediment revealed 1–4 erythrocytes, 1–4 leukocytes, 1–4 squamous cells, and 0-1 transitional cells per HPF, but no casts.

Serological tests showed C-reactive protein of 0.2 mg/dL. Coagulation parameters were normal. Chest X-ray showed congestion of the lung fields. The patient had pulmonary edema and uremic symptoms (vomiting and consciousness disorder). We performed brain MRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate cerebral function.
T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI showed several old, small brain infarcts (Figures and ). Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) did not show increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which would be suggestive of vasogenic edema. EEG showed frequent slow waves, consistent with metabolic encephalopathy ().
The patient was placed on short-duration HD (2 hours) with smaller surface area (cellulose triacetate; membrane area: 0.7 m2) and low blood flow (100 mL/min) to avoid DDS (). His consciousness gradually improved and he did not develop symptoms of DDS.

DWI demonstrated no hyperintense signal alterations in these regions. He had no cerebral infarcts, but the ADC was elevated in bilateral occipital lesions (Figures and ). Thus, although the patient did not have clinical symptoms of DDS, we diagnosed that he had asymptomatic brain edema. EEG on day 15 had been compared with the findings on admission; namely, the slow waves on EEG had decreased, consistent with improving uremic encephalopathy. The patient underwent vascular access surgery for HD and continued maintenance HD. On day 29, a third MRI was performed and showed return to findings on admission ().

No further neurological disturbances were noted during 1-year follow-up.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [168.0, 'cm']}",64.127,60.921,67.333,"The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 66.142 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (66.142 (in inches) - 60) = 64.127 kg.

5545,26,Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-6935651-1,Extracted,"A 14-year-old girl, living in a refugee camp, was referred from a district hospital for the management of altered level of consciousness, fever, and hyperglycemia. Fever started 2 weeks prior to consultation for which she received empiric treatment for malaria in a district hospital. She was also diagnosed with severe acute on chronic malnutrition for which she received ready-to-use therapeutic food. The situation was worsened by polyuria, excessive thirst, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, persistent fever and progressive lethargy, necessitating her transfer to the endocrinology unit of the Mother and Child Center of Yaounde.
Past history was remarkable for diabetes which was diagnosed a year ago after 2 months of polyuria and excessive thirst. Insulin therapy was started at 0.5 IU/Kg/day with mixed insulin but patient's compliance was poor. She reported loss of sight 7 months ago (3 months after the diagnosis of diabetes). She is the 3rd child in a nonconsanguineous family of 10 children of whom three are alive. They fled the Central African Republic to Cameroon and for the past 4 years have been living in a refugee camp in the East region of Cameroon. Neither she nor the mother went to school.
On admission, she was lethargic (Glasgow coma scale was 13/15). Her weight was 19 kg (<3rd percentile), her height was 133 cm (<3rd percentile) for a BMI of 10.7 kg/m2, −5.5 SD for age. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure: 100/80 mm Hg, pulse: 100 bpm, respiratory rate 34 cycles/min and temperature was 36.8°C. She had fine hair and poor dental hygiene. Her Tanner stage was B1P1. Her abdomen was distended with no palpable mass. She had vulvovaginal erythema. She had a dry mouth, sunken eyes, mixed signs of dehydration and severe malnutrition (skin pinch went back slowly) and bilateral leucocoria.
Her serum glucose level was 440 mg/dL (24.4 mmol/L), K + 3.3 mmol/L, corrected Na + 148.4 mmol/L, Cl-108 mmol/L. HbA1C was 12% (108 mmol/mol). Urinalysis revealed nitrites (3+), ketones (2+), glycosuria (3+), and culture later on showed growth of E coli. Her hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL, white blood cell count was 9500/mm3, and platelets count was 308 000/mm3. Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) were in the upper limits (42 and 44 IU/L, respectively) and renal function was normal (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 0.07 g/L, serum creatinine 3 mg/L). Blood proteins were 93 g/L. Blood gases were not available.
She was admitted to the intensive care unit. She received oral rehydration solution for the malnourished (10 mL/kg/hr for 2 hours) followed by 1.5 L/m2/day of normal saline intravenously (IV) and KCL 1.5 g/L (IV) for 24 hours. Rapid-acting insulin was started 2 hours later with an hourly subcutaneous dose of 0.1 IU/Kg. An antibiotic was also given (ceftriaxone at 50 mg/kg/day) as well as routine de-worming with a single dose of 400 mg of albendazole. Four hours following admission, she was more reactive; ketonuria was 1+, serum glucose level was 408 mg/dL (22.4 mmol/L). Rapid-acting insulin was replaced by multiple injections using neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH) and actrapid (1IU/kg/day). Ready-to-use therapeutic food F75 (75 kcal/100 mL) was started at 130 mL/kg/day divided into eight meals. Folic acid (5 mg once) and vitamin A (200 mg on days 1, 2, and 14) were added to the treatment.
The day after admission, she developed lower limb edema and abdominal distension without ascites and IV fluids were stopped. The oedema regressed on day 2. On day 3, the F75 was replaced with F100 (100 kcal/100 mL) 130 ml/kg/day and progressive introduction of Plumpy Nut® and normal food. Progression of her nutritional status is shown in Table .
Communication with and education of patient and her family was difficult because of unavailability of a translator trained in medical terminology and the fact that the patient was almost blind. This was partially improved following her cataract surgery performed 2 months later.
Upon discharge after 9 weeks spent in hospital, her weight was 29 kg, height 133 cm (BMI 16.4 kg/m2) and MUAC of 160 mm. She was discharged to her refugee camp on multiple insulin injections. Two months later, her weight was 32 kg, height 135 mm (BMI 17.56 kg/m2) and HbA1 C 10%.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [440.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [148.4, 'mmol/L']}",156.56,148.732,164.388,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 148.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.4 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.4 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.4 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.4 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.4 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 440.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 148.4 mEq/L + 0.024 * (440.0 - 100) = 156.56 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 156.56 mEq/L."
7836,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-6693215-2,Extracted,"Patient 2 was a 22-year-old Caucasian man referred by his psychiatrist for trouble with his sleep of many years’ duration. Sometimes, he slept throughout the night without issues but awakened unrefreshed and fatigued, unable to handle daily activities. Sometimes, he was unable to sleep for three or four consecutive nights and could not function at all. His inability to sleep was episodic, having no pattern and no trigger. He reported minimal caffeine intake and denied substance abuse or recreational drug use. He had tried a variety of medications, and none had improved his sleep (zolpidem, escitalopram, trazodone, and melatonin). He was unable to maintain a job or attend college, which was the reason he requested a sleep evaluation.
On nights that he could not fall asleep, the patient experienced intrusive thoughts but no restless legs syndrome. Once asleep, the patient did not snore, have witnessed apnea, or awaken choking or gasping. He did grind his teeth. He was a restless sleeper, and his bed was in disarray in the morning. He was not aware of walking or talking in his sleep. He experienced nightmares twice monthly.
During the patient’s childhood, his pediatrician had sent him for a polysomnogram. The result was “inconclusive,” and he never returned to the sleep medicine specialist for follow-up. At the age of 15, he had a palate expander for about 8 months, but he had “a lot of issues” with it, and it was discontinued. In addition to his insomnia, he had chronic sinus infections, anxiety, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, migraine headaches, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. He took no medications.
The patient’s ESS score was 3/24, indicating no sleepiness; his FSS score was 5.2/7.0, indicating moderate to severe fatigue; his ISI score of 17/28 characterized severe sleep onset insomnia without sleep maintenance problems; and his BSQ score of 33/85 was consistent with the presence of somatic arousal. The patient completed a self-report depression scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), on which he scored 21/27, severe depression, with suicidal ideation more than half his days. Therefore, the questionnaire data reflected severe depression with severe sleep onset insomnia, characterized by somatic arousal and severe fatigue (Fig. ).
On physical examination, the patient’s height was 178 cm, and his weight was 109 kg (BMI 34.4 kg/m2). The patient had gained 18 kg over the preceding 6 months after severe back pain limited his activity. His blood pressure was 127/80 mmHg with a peripheral pulse of 80. His oral airway was characterized by a high-arched, mildly narrowed, hard palate with an elongated soft palate and a Mallampati score of 3. The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable.
On the morning following the patient’s polysomnogram, he claimed that it had taken him a “long time” to fall asleep and that he had slept, lightly, for only 3 to 4 hours. The polysomnogram demonstrated a sleep latency of 28 minutes (the upper limit of normal is 30 minutes), a total sleep time of 375 minutes, and a sleep efficiency of 89% (normal). N2 sleep percentage was slightly increased (60%); REM latency was prolonged (time to REM sleep onset 148.5 minutes); and the percentage of REM sleep was decreased (14%). The patient’s apnea-hypopnea index was 6.2 with a RDI of 12.2, consistent with mild OSA [].
To treat the patient’s mild OSA, we prescribed nasal autotitrating CPAP (APAP) with pressure limits of 4 cmH2O and 8 cmH2O. Simultaneously, he was referred to a maxillofacial surgeon to be considered for curative MMA. After weeks of attempting to sleep with nasal APAP, the patient was unable. We referred the patient to a dentist for a mandibular advancement device, and he went for a consultation, but he did not purchase a device. The maxillofacial surgeon told the patient that he was a candidate for MMA but that he would first have to have his wisdom teeth removed and allow 6 months for healing. He elected to have his wisdom teeth removed.
While the patient waited for 6 months, his symptom pattern continued unabated. He experienced several consecutive days “without sleep” followed by a better night but without an improvement in his daytime fatigue or his affect. He worried that his intellectual capacity was deteriorating. He also expressed skepticism about his insomnia improving after MMA.
Approximately 1 year after first being seen, the patient returned to the SBUSDC. His symptoms were always worse during the late fall and winter, and he sensed they were worsening. He complained of severe insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness with tension headaches every other day and chronic back pain that was being treated with injections. His ISI score was 24/28, and his BSQ score was 47/85, indicating severe insomnia with marked somatic arousal. His FSS score was 6.3/7.0, indicating severe fatigue, and his PHQ-9 score was 17/27, indicating moderately symptomatic depression (Fig. ). The patient was encouraged to proceed with MMA as a curative procedure for all his symptoms, and he left the appointment committed to proceeding with MMA.
The patient’s MMA was performed 13 months following his initial sleep consultation. The procedure included a LeFort 1 maxillary advancement, a bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy to elongate the body of the mandible, positioning the tongue forward, and an anterior inferior mandibular osteotomy (genioplasty) to further advance the tongue and create a more prominent chin (the procedure illustrated in Fig. ). Figure demonstrates the patient’s upper airway anatomy before and after surgery.
The effect of MMA on the patient’s insomnia came quickly. At 6 weeks postoperatively, the patient observed “more restful sleep,” feeling tired and ready for bed in the late afternoon/evenings and awakening more easily in the morning. Preoperatively, he had required a very loud alarm to arouse him, whereas postoperatively, he awakened to his vibrating cellular phone. Overall, the patient felt better, and his family noticed. At 7 months postoperatively, the patient slept an average of 8 hours per night, which he considered a “fantastic” outcome.
An unanticipated effect of the MMA procedure was a large weight loss. The patient observed that although he did not diet or increase his exercise, he was not “constantly craving calories,” and he ate “significantly less,” going longer between snacks and meals. The patient lost 19 kg between his initial visit and his final visit 23 months later.
By 7 months, the patient’s affect had greatly improved, and his confidence in his improved health had greatly increased. He was accepted into an online college program and made plans to relocate from Long Island to a city in the southwestern United States, where his opportunities to balance work with school and recreation were better. The patient’s questionnaire scores over the year following surgery (Fig. ) demonstrate the rapid and persistent resolution of his insomnia, fatigue, somatic arousal (BSQ), and depression.
Polysomnography was performed 9 months postoperatively. On the morning following the study, the patient claimed not to know how long it took to fall asleep and that he slept poorly compared with home, for 5 to 6 hours. The polysomnogram demonstrated a sleep latency of 7.5 minutes, a total sleep time of 346.5 minutes, and a sleep efficiency of 75%. Compared with his first polysomnogram, the patient’s sleep was less consolidated. After initially falling asleep for 45 minutes, the patient awakened for nearly 2 hours before returning to sleep for the rest of the night. N2 sleep percentage was slightly increased (58%); REM latency was prolonged (223.5 minutes); and the percentage of REM sleep was normal (19%). The patient continued to have sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea-hypopnea index of 3.3 and an RDI of 6.8, no longer meeting criteria for OSA (RDI ≥ 15 in an asymptomatic individual) []. The patient’s worsened sleep maintenance was attributed to a “first-night effect,” the lighter, less continuous sleep of a “healthy” individual sleeping in a novel environment [, ].",What is the patient's body surface area?

674,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-8519794-1,Extracted,"A 72-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department (ED) after a primary care physician referral for tachycardia, who saw her with complaints of epigastric discomfort, vomiting, and loss of appetite for the past 2 days. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at the clinic revealed a narrow complex tachycardia of 169 beats/min. She was admitted for ischemic stroke 6 months earlier and was on aspirin. During that admission, PSVT developed but was successfully treated with intravenous (IV) adenosine. She was reviewed by the cardiologist, and 2D echocardiography was performed, which did not reveal any underlying structural heart abnormalities. In addition, an electrophysiological study confirmed the underlying etiology of PSVT as AVNRT.
On arrival, she was alert with a temperature of 37.3°C; heart rate of 170 beats/min; respiratory rate of 25 cycles/min; blood pressure of 112/81 mm/Hg; and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her physical examination was normal. The ECG revealed a narrow complex tachycardia suggestive of AVNRT due to the presence of retrograde conduction of P waves in leads I and aVR (). Previous ECG documented in electronic health records did not show any signs of pre-excitation for AVRT from an accessory pathway or prolonged QTc syndrome. She was observed on continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring throughout her ED stay.
Vagal maneuver (Valsalva) was attempted without success. A carotid sinus massage was not performed as the patient had a stroke history. IV adenosine at 6 mg was given for pharmacological conversion. Shortly after IV adenosine administration, the patient became unresponsive and developed a generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure. Pulse was absent, and the cardiac monitor revealed ventricular fibrillation (VF). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately started together with the preparation for defibrillation. However, just before defibrillation, the seizure spontaneously aborted and she had a palpable pulse with a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The whole episode of seizure and VF lasted for approximately 8–10 s. The cardiac monitor revealed a normal sinus rhythm conversion and the patient spontaneously regained consciousness. Repeat vital signs were stable with a heart rate of 72 beats/min; blood pressure of 102/62 mm/Hg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.
A rhythm strip () review recorded during the IV adenosine administration revealed an initial suppression of the AV conduction lasting for approximately 6 s interspersed, with non-conducted P waves and ventricular escape beats (), in which the last escape beat triggered the onset of VF (), which lasted for approximately 8 s. The VF duration corresponded to the GTC seizure duration, indicating a convulsive syncope secondary to VF resulting in seizure. The patient does not have any history of epilepsy. This was followed by spontaneous VF termination and continued AV conduction suppression with a period of aberrantly conducted supraventricular impulses () before sinus rhythm reversion (). A repeat ECG post adenosine administration did not reveal any pre-excitation features ().
Blood investigations were done in the ED upon patient arrival before adenosine administration. These included a complete blood count with hematocrit level, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function test, which all revealed normal results. Coupled with her normal physical examination without signs of dehydration and ECG that was not suggestive of sinus tachycardia, the possibility of dehydration as a contributory factor to the tachycardia was ruled out. The patient was admitted to the High Dependency Unit (HDU) under cardiology. During admission, her serial cardiac enzymes were normal. Her symptoms of epigastric discomfort and vomiting were attributed to gastritis. She had another episode of SVT in the HDU, which was successfully converted with IV diltiazem. Myocardial perfusion imaging was negative for ischemia, and the transthoracic echocardiography revealed a normal ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities. An electrophysiological study was not performed during this admission due to her advanced age and other co-morbidities. She was discharged stable after a few days and was started on long-term oral diltiazem.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Female', 'Thromboembolism history': False, 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': True, 'Vascular disease history': False, 'age': [72, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': False, 'Stroke': True}",4,4,4,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.

The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2.
Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 4. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 4.

In 2005, during her first pregnancy, she had developed proteinuria and preeclampsia. The proteinuria subsided after she had given birth; however, it recurred during a second pregnancy in 2006 and increased to the nephrotic range. The second pregnancy was otherwise uneventful, and after delivery, the degree of proteinuria trended down to a nadir of 120 mg/g creatinine by 2009. She subsequently presented to our hospital in 2012 when the proteinuria again increased, reaching 4,600 mg/24 h (or 2,900 mg/g creatinine).
The patient had no past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, or other systemic illnesses. She was not taking any medications, had no known allergies and denied ever smoking or having used illicit drugs. Of note, both her father and maternal grandmother had type 2 DM and her father had had a stroke at age 50.
On examination, her blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg and her BMI was 33. There was no edema, acanthosis nigricans, or hirsuitism. Fundoscopy did not reveal any diabetic retinopathy. Laboratory values included 0.7 mg/dl serum creatinine, 167 mg/dl total cholesterol, 42 mg/dl HDL cholesterol, and 77 mg/dl triglycerides. Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria with no hematuria. Tests for HIV, RPR, HBV, HCV, ANA, C3, and C4 were all negative or normal. Fasting glucose was 80 mg/dl and HbA1C was 5.8%. Renal ultrasound revealed kidneys 12 cm in size.
A renal biopsy was obtained in October 2012. Of the 7 glomeruli present, none were globally or partially sclerotic. Glomerulomegaly was not present. Using an eyepiece micrometer, the mean glomerular diameter was 175 ± 12 μm, a value within the reported normal range. One glomerulus evidenced segmental hyalinosis. Otherwise, the glomeruli were unremarkable by light microscopy (fig. ). Evidence of chronicity such as interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was absent. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed mild (1–2+) pseudolinear staining of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) for IgG. No other immunoglobulin classes or complement components were detectable. Electron microscopy showed that the lamina densa of the GBMs were diffusely thickened, averaging 700–900 nm (fig. ). The podocytes were not vacuolated and, importantly, their foot processes were not effaced (fig. ). The endothelial cells were swollen with loss of fenestrations. Hyaline deposits were also noted in the glomerular capillary wall (fig. ), a finding corresponding to the light microscopic changes mentioned above.
Our patient was serially evaluated for impaired glucose metabolism. Fasting blood glucoses ranged from 80 to 111 mg/dl (with only two values ≥100 mg/dl). HbA1C ranged from 5.6 to 5.9%. Fluorescein angiography was negative for diabetic retinopathy. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was normal with a 2-hour glucose level of 109 mg/dl. The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was elevated at 2.93 and 3.74, a result that indicates IR (normal value: 1) in the face of adequate insulin secretion to maintain normoglycemia and a normal OGTT.",What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

He was born in Tabasco State (in the southern part of Mexico). No consanguinity or endogamy was reported. The patient’s parents and an older sister were healthy, but he had another sister who died at 15 years old with similar manifestations. The mother reported a history of a first-trimester spontaneous abortion. There was no other relevant family history (). The patient was the product of a naturally conceived 38-week singleton pregnancy to a 33-year-old mother and 37-year-old father, uneventful pregnancy with two normal prenatal ultrasounds. Delivery was via emergency cesarean section for prolonged rupture of membranes. At birth weight the patient was 3,100 g [46th centile; −0.1 standard deviation scores (SDS)] and length was 50 cm (50th centile; 0.5 SDS); additional birth parameters and APGAR score were unknown. He did not require respiratory support or supplementary interventions. He left the hospital 2 days after delivery. He was hospitalized for 30 days at 9 months of age due to seizures. During this hospitalization he was first noted to have some developmental delay; the mother reported the loss of some abilities after the onset of seizures.
He was first seen by a geneticist at 5 years old; however, no diagnosis was integrated. He was re-evaluated by geneticists at 10.8 years old. The anthropometric features were 32.3 kg of weight (24th centile; −0.71 SDS), 151 cm of height (85th centile; + 1.05 SDS), and 49.2 cm of head circumference (< 3rd centile; −3.01 SDS) (HP:0000252); the head circumference measurement at 4 years old was 46.3 cm (< 3rd centile; −2.72 SDS), no previous head circumference evaluation was available.

He was recently started on pazopanib for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC. Pazopanib was started at 75% of the recommended dose. At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.
Within the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation.

1384,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-6580543-1,Extracted,"During a hot afternoon in July, a 48-year-old man developed symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, while working outdoors for 2 h in a southern city in China. The outside temperature at that time was 35 °C. Notably, the patient lived in the north part of China and had traveled to the southern part when he was sick. After 15 h, he went into coma and was then transferred to the emergency department of the hospital. The patient was in good health before the onset of the disease. Upon arrival, the temperature of the patient was 40.2 °C, blood pressure was 75/40 mmHg, and pulse rate was 100 beats/min. His blood oxygen saturation under balloon-assisted ventilation was 95%. Laboratory tests indicated rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney injury, hepatic disfunction, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. The serum D-dimer level of the patient was elevated at 1022 (normal range: 0–232) μg/L. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with HS. He was immediately treated with a cooling blanket and plasma exchange and received assisted ventilation. Brain CT scans performed on the 3rd day of admission showed symmetrical low-density lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia. On the 7th day of admission, the patient’s state of consciousness improved. However, he experienced blurred vision. Eye examination results were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 8 days after admission. Cerebral MRI revealed a slight hyperintensity in the bilateral putamen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence and bilateral symmetrical hypointensity in the middle of the putamen and hyperintensity around hypointensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) sequence. The lesions showed hyperintensity in the middle of the bilateral putamen and hypointensity around them on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) sequence (Fig. A-E). Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in sagittal projection performed on the 12th day of admission showed the absence of a straight sinus and vein of Galen, indicating CVT. In addition, the lack of flow signal was also found in the distal part of the superior sagittal sinus that also corresponds to CVT (Fig. F). Intravenous treatment of mannitol, subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin calcium (5000 IU, two times/day) was initiated to reduce high intracranial pressure and to treat CVT. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination conducted on day 17 showed elevated protein levels at 1.87 (normal range: 0.15–0.45 g/L and immunoglobulin G levels at 267.0 (normal range: 0–34.0) mg/L. The CSF pressure was 210 (normal range: 80–180) mmH2O. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) obtained on the same day indicated bilateral hemosiderin deposition or hemorrhagic foci in the basal ganglia (Fig. ). Follow-up MRI obtained 25 days after admission showed symmetrical abnormal signals in the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, putamen, external capsule, and insular lobe. The signals were hypointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI, FLAIR, and ADC and were not limited by diffusion on DWI. Strip and dot-like signals, which were isointense and slightly hypointense on T1WI and hypointense on T2WI, can be observed in the lesions. DWI revealed bilateral hyperintensity on the frontal and occipital lobes (Fig. A1–E3). The flow signals of the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus, and vein of Galen were significantly better on follow-up MRV (Fig. ). On the 28th day of admission, after the administration of gadolinium, MRI revealed abnormal enhancement within the bilateral basal ganglia, and the size of the lesions decreased on MRI conducted 25 days after admission (Fig. ). The patient was discharged with blurred vision on the 38th day.

294,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-8547566-1,Extracted,"A 27-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of asthenia, adynamia and weight loss associated with lower urinary tract symptoms and subfebrile temperature. Ten years before, she had undergone a pediatric en-bloc kidney transplant because of end-stage kidney disease secondary to perinatal asphyxia syndrome. Asphyxia can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and a redistribution of cardiac output to maintain cerebral, cardiac and adrenal perfusion while potentially compromising renal, gastrointestinal and skin perfusion as circulatory response.
One allograft was located in the right iliac fossa (upside-down implantation with ureteric anastomosis following Lich-Gregoir technique, violet in Fig. ) and the other in the right flank (end-to-side uretero-ureteral anastomosis with native right kidney, blue and orange in Fig. ). The en-bloc graft was made to rest on the right psoas muscle, and the graft vena cava was anastomosed terminolaterally to the recipient external iliac vein using 6–0 polypropylene suture. The graft aorta was also anastomosed terminolaterally to the right external iliac artery using 7–0 polypropylene suture.
Our patient presented other comorbidities as well such as hypertension, asymptomatic, bilateral cataracts, intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss and Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW pattern or preexcitation consisting of a short PR interval and prolonged QRS with an initial slurring upstroke—“delta” wave—in the presence of sinus rhythm) with episodic palpitations and lightheadedness. Anthropometric features are : height 125 cm, weight 25 kg, BMI = 14.2. She reported 10 kg weight loss in the last 5 months due to depression symptoms associated with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) quarantine. Her daily medication was: prednisone 4 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, atenolol 25 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg, mycophenolic acid 250 mg/250 mg and tacrolimus 2 mg/2 mg.
The main abnormalities in the laboratory data were white blood cells count 15,654/mm3, serum creatinine level 1 mg/dl (baseline: 0.6 mg/dl), lactate 3.6 mmol/l and pH 7.39.
Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan showed staghorn calculi in the kidney allograft implanted in the right iliac fossa composed of at least 3 stones of 12.5 mm, 13.7 mm and 10 mm located in superior, medium and inferior calyx, respectively (530 Hounsfield Units) (Fig. ). Moreover, both the right flank transplanted kidney and the right native kidney had severe pelvicalyceal dilation because of two ureteral stones of 6.7 mm and 5.9 mm impacted in the uretero-ureteral anastomosis (450 to 510 HU). Finally, a 7.2-mm stone was reported in the lower calyx of her right native kidney (457 HU).
Initial management consisted in hospital admission and empiric treatment with ceftriaxone. After 24 h of empiric ceftriaxone and following our COVID19 protocol, an attempt to perform primary URS of the ureteral stones was carried out. Nevertheless, once the guidewire (Sensor™ PTFE-Nitinol Guidewire with Hydrophilic Tip, Boston Scientific®) passed through the ureteral stones, purulent material came out from the ureteral meatus. Due to this finding, we decided to take an upper urinary tract urine sample for culture, place a double pig-tail stent and a bladder catheter, and stop the procedure. She stayed 9 days in-hospital for management of postobstructive polyuria and was discharged with oral antimicrobial agents (ciprofloxacin and fluconazole) and without the bladder catheter.
Definitive operative treatment of urolithiasis was performed three weeks thereafter. The traditional lithotomy position, in this unprecedented patient, allowed both antegrade and retrograde access. After removing ureteral stent, semirigid ureteroscopy (8Fr, Richard Wolf, Germany®) and Holmium-YAG laser lithotripsy of the ureteral stones (120 W, Lumenis®) were carried out. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) (Flex X2, Karl Storz®) was required to treat the stone located in the inferior calyx of the native kidney. Fragmentation of the stones was executed using these laser settings: 0.8 J and 10 Hz. Fragments were removed using a nitinol stone-retrieval frontal basket (NGage, Cook Medical®).
At the meantime, upper pole puncture of the right iliac fossa allograft was performed under ultrasound (US) guidance by a second endourologist. Endovision puncture was not attempted in order to protect the reusable flexible ureteroscope from an extreme proximal ureteral kinking loop (Fig. B).
Tract dilation was accomplished using one-shot dilator to establish a 21-Fr working channel over the guidewire. Mini-PNL (MIP Storz 12 Fr Nephroscope ®) was performed with Holmium-YAG laser dusting of the stones (settings: 0.5 J and 50 Hz). Stone fragments and dust were flushed out through the sheath by vortex effect. After most of the stone fragments had been removed, antegrade flexible nephroscopy (Flexible Fiber-Cystoscope 15Fr, Richard Wolf, Germany®) was conducted to search for residual stones in locations that were inaccessible with the rigid nephroscope (Fig. C). A 14-Fr 100% silicon nephrostomy tube and a bladder catheter were left in place. Operating time was 120 min. Estimated blood loss was approximately 50 cc.
Postoperative NCCT scan, performed 12 h postoperatively, showed neither residual fragments nor suggestive signs of immediate postoperative complications (Fig. ). Both the nephrostomy and the bladder catheter were removed the following day. The patient remained in hospital for 3 days because of tacrolimus blood levels fluctuation. Neither early nor late onset postoperative complications occurred.
After 10 months from discharge, the patient remains stone-free. She is now under magnesium supplement and nitrofurantoin 100 mg daily prophylaxis since crystallographic analysis showed ammonium magnesium phosphate as the main component of the stones. Every six months ultrasound will be performed as follow-up.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [27, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.0, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Female'}",79.188,75.229,83.147,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 27 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.0/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**27 * 1.012 = 79.188.
Hence, the GFR value is 79.188 ml/min/1.73 m²."

attributable etiology for his weakness was evident. Around the same time, he also started
developing short-term memory loss.
On presentation to our facility, complete blood count was unremarkable, and creatinine was
5.97 mg/dL. Baseline creatinine was 0.85 mg/dL 6 months prior to admission. Urinalysis
revealed specific gravity 1.017, large occult blood, white blood cells (WBC) 15 to 25 cells,
trace ketones, and no evidence of infection. Due to oliguric acute kidney injury with
altered mental status suggestive of uremia, dialysis was initiated. Workup for the confusion
including noncontrast MRI brain showed extensive white matter changes. Cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) analysis showed glucose 29 mg/dL, protein 120 mg/dL, WBC 68 cells/mm3 with
77% lymphocytes, and red blood cells 119 cells/mm3. Computed tomography (CT) scan
of chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed pleural effusion and mildly enlarged subcarinal lymph
node. Infectious workup was also negative. Urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio was 851
(0-28) and urine protein to creatinine ratio was 1.81 (normal less than 0.20). Serum protein
electrophoresis (SPEP) was positive for M spike. Immunofixation electrophoresis showed IgM
kappa monoclonal protein and second IgM monoclonal protein with probable kappa light chain.
IgM kappa monoclonal protein #1 concentration was 0.2 g/dL and IgM monoclonal protein #2
concentration was less than 0.1 g/dL. Urine protein electrophoresis showed M spike and urine
immunofixation electrophoresis showed Bence Jones protein, kappa type. Free kappa light
chain was 924 mg/dL (3.3-19.4 mg/dL), free lambda light chain was 24 mg/dL (5.7-26.3 mg/dL),
with a kappa/lambda ratio of 38.2 (0.26-1.65). A kidney biopsy was ultimately performed,
which showed extensive glomerular and arteriolar IgM kappa hyaline thrombi and glomerular
features of thrombotic microangiopathy. A few kappa light chain restricted casts were seen
suspicious for light chain nephropathy. Findings were deemed secondary to IgM kappa
monoclonal protein. A subsequent bone marrow biopsy was consistent with lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma. Lymphoid aggregates were composed of CD20 positive B cells with admixed CD138
positive plasma cells with kappa predominance (-). Karyotype showed normal cytogenetics and molecular studies detected a MYD88
L265P mutation. CXCR4 mutation was not detected. HIV and hepatitis B tests were negative. He
was treated with methylprednisolone 500 mg for 3 days followed by a prednisone taper. He
also underwent 2 sessions of plasmapheresis as viscosity was not available at that time and
patients had concerning symptoms of hyperviscosity. Later on, his serum viscosity turned out
to be normal (1.5 centipoises). Dialysis was discontinued prior to discharge from hospital
as his kidney function recovered with good urine output (creatinine 2.81 mg/dL).
Subsequently, a month later, his creatinine in the follow-up hematology clinic visit was
1.35 mg/dL. He had a follow-up with nephrology and no more dialysis was needed. He was then
initiated on treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (RCD). IgM level
at the time of treatment initiation was 1402 mg/dL. It increased to 1650 mg/dL after 1 month
and 1877 mg/dL after 2 months. He was readmitted 3 months after initiation of chemotherapy
with a 30-minute episode of right-sided facial weakness, slurred speech, and right upper
extremity weakness. CT head showed severe white matter changes with scattered areas of
enhancement with surrounding vasogenic edema. CT angiography was unremarkable. CSF studies
showed opening pressure of 17, glucose 70 mg/dL, protein 72 mg/dL, WBC 4
cells/mm3, and red blood cells 4 cells/mm3. No definitive etiology
was again attributable to these findings. A month later, he was readmitted with seizures.
His hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and
aspiration pneumonia. He was started on eliquis. MRI brain showed persistent extensive
periventricular leukomalacia. He was placed on dexamethasone. He continued to have issues
with memory loss and weakness. He benefited with RCD treatment with continued stabilization
of his renal function but his M protein was overall unchanged. After 5 cycles of RCD, his
IgM was 1108 mg/dL. His SPEP showed an IgM monoclonal spike of 0.8 with kappa light chain
specificity. Another lumbar puncture was pursued after holding his steroids for 2 weeks and
the CSF analysis indicated elevated protein, decreased glucose, and elevated WBC with
lymphocytic predominance. His lumbar puncture was abnormal but not definitive for diagnosis
of CNS involvement by lymphoma. Brain biopsy was discussed but patient deferred the
procedure. A repeat MRI was done that showed progression of white matter enhancement (). Due to the persistent
imaging findings, suspicion of CNS involvement by lymphoma was high. As he had been treated
with multiple courses of steroids, the diagnostic yield of CSF for definitive diagnosis was
likely low. He was started on ibrutinib 420 mg daily. Eliquis was held in consultation with
cardiology. After initiation of therapy, the patient noted dramatic improvement in memory
and weakness. Repeat MRI brain after 2 months of ibrutinib showed complete resolution of
intracranial enhancement (). His IgM protein as well as his M spike have largely remained stable since. The
patient is currently tolerating ibrutinib well with no complications.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Male', 'creatinine': [5.97, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [58, 'years']}",10.222,9.711,10.733,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 58 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 5.97 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (5.97/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**58 * 1.0 = 10.222.

He also reported at least 3 days of progressive dyspnea and the absence of bowel movements. Upon presentation to the hospital, he required 2 L/min oxygen by nasal cannula, but was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention with tenderness to palpation, voluntary guarding, and an umbilical hernia.
Admission laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 25.7 K/cmm, sodium of 133 mmol/L, chloride of 95 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 28 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL with normal transaminase levels, lactate dehydrogenase of 186 units/L, lactate of 4.1 mmol/L, procalcitonin of 0.15 ng/mL, ferritin of 143.87 ng/mL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of 23.0 mg/L. Respiratory pathogen panel was negative, and SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab. Two sets of blood cultures and one urine culture were obtained. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast showed a distended stomach, dilated loops of small bowel, a fat-containing ventral wall hernia, and an umbilical hernia containing small bowel that was concerning for a transition point (). A nasogastric tube was placed by the general surgery team in the emergency department with immediate return of 2 liters of feculent material. The patient's umbilical hernia was manually reduced with palliation of the abdominal pain. The patient also received 3 liters of crystalloid fluid with improvement in both lactate and white blood cell count.
After the initial improvement in exam and inflammatory markers with nasogastric decompression and crystalloids, the patient was admitted to the general surgery service for conservative management of suspected small bowel obstruction. Over the next 4 hospital days, the patient had decreased abdominal pain, was stable on room air, and had resolution of all laboratory abnormalities. His initial blood cultures on admission remained negative. On hospital day 5, the patient's nasogastric tube was removed without complication after he began passing flatus. Several hours later, he became hypoxemic to 88% on room air with increased abdominal distension, hypotension, and tachycardia. Empiric vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, doxycycline, and crystalloids were instituted after repeat blood and urine culture collection. Portable upright abdominal radiograph showed distended loops of bowel without free air, while chest radiograph showed new patchy bibasilar opacities. Evaluation by the surgical team revealed a stable abdominal exam without rebound tenderness following resuscitation and antibiotics. Surgical bowel exploration was considered, but deferred due to his stable abdominal exam and high intraoperative mortality risk. He remained afebrile, but had increasing tachypnea and required up to 4 L/min oxygen by nasal cannula. Further imaging studies were deferred at the time due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count increase to 14.6 k/cmm, creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, ferritin of 691.79 ng/dL, procalcitonin level of 15.93 ng/mL, D-dimer of 1203 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase of 241 units/L, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of greater than 160 mg/L, and lactate of 3.1 mmol/L (). COVID-19 pneumonia was suspected, and a repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was sent and was negative. Given concerns for a false-negative RT-PCR test result, the patient was transferred to the dedicated COVID-19 unit for airborne isolation in a negative pressure room. The following day, the patient's inflammatory markers worsened with persistent hypoxemia. A third nasopharyngeal swab was sent for RT-PCR, but was negative. On hospital day 7, both sets of repeat blood cultures grew a Gram-positive bacillus later identified as Clostridium sporogenes. Sensitivities were not performed as per the microbiology laboratory's protocol for anaerobic organisms, but the isolate was beta-lactamase negative.
After stabilization, repeat computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis without intravenous contrast revealed focal ground glass opacities in the left upper lobe, bibasilar airspace disease, and new asymmetric thickening of the left rectus muscle with fluid consistent with abscess formation. The patient's creatinine peaked at 4.5 mg/dL before decreasing with judicious administration of intravenous crystalloid for suspected acute tubular necrosis. Urine culture showed no growth, and urine legionella antigen was not detected. The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and later meropenem with improvement of most inflammatory markers, but with persistent leukocytosis. On hospital day 10, after discussion with the surgery service regarding surgical intervention and the associated mortality risk, the patient decided to pursue comfort measures only. He was transferred to an inpatient hospice facility and died two days later.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Sodium': [133.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [28.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Chloride': [95.0, 'mmol/L']}",10.0,9.5,10.5,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 95.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 95.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 95.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 95.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 95.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 95.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 28.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 28.0 mmol.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 28.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 28.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 28.0 mEq/L) = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 10.0 mEq/L."

He reported no trauma history, but during the past few hours, pain had severely deteriorated. In regards to his past medical history, the patient was on treatment for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. In particular, he was on an angiotensin II receptor blocker and on warfarin as an oral anticoagulant.
The patient was afebrile, and his vital signs were within normal values (blood pressure 115/78 mmHg, heart rate 82 beats/min, SpO2 99%). Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain, radiating on the posterior aspect of the left thigh. Peripheral vascular examination was within normal values on both lower limbs, with palpable pulses and capillary refill time of less than two seconds. Neurological condition, on the other hand, was impaired on the left lower limb, and objective deficiencies were obvious. Examination revealed reduced strength of the left lower limb. The patient was unable to straight leg raise, to flex the hip or the knee, and had developed hypoesthesia on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The patella reflex was absent on the affected side.
Laboratory data revealed prolonged prothrombin time with an international normalized ratio (INR) level of 4.5, and a haematocrit and haemoglobin decrease of 33.1% and 10.7 g/l, respectively. The rest of the full laboratory analysis was within normal values. Imaging studies included abdominal ultrasound scan (US), lumbar spine, and pelvis CT scans. Lumbar spine pathology was excluded, and a large retroperitoneal haematoma was unveiled within and around the left iliopsoas muscle (35 cm x 9 cm x 6 cm) (Figure ).
The patient was admitted to the hospital, and warfarin anticoagulation regimen was intermitted. Prolonged INR was reversed within 48 hours with the aid of vitamin K administration. A new CT scan was performed on day 3 post-admission. No change in the size of the haematoma was revealed (Figure ). At that point, there was a consultation with the radiology department whether the haematoma could be percutaneously drained; however, the CT scan revealed a clotted formation that would not allow for successful drainage.
The patient was managed conservatively. Physical therapy had been initiated by day 1 post-admission. The patient was discharged after six days of hospitalization and after pain management had been established. Nerve conduction studies were performed three weeks later and revealed left femoral nerve palsy. A new CT scan was performed two months post-discharge and unveiled absorption and a significantly reduced size of the haematoma (Figure ).

Findings of an extensive work-up were subsequently unrevealing, including normal results of colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colon biopsy, mesenteric Doppler studies, and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis. Video capsule endoscopy demonstrated a questionable adynamic ileus. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride, polyethylene glycol 3350, tramadol, and simethicone had failed to relieve symptoms. The patient’s family decided to sign him out of the outside hospital from the inpatient service and drive him directly to our ED for evaluation in the middle of the night.
On initial presentation to our ED, the patient complained of left-sided abdominal pain described as aching and one episode of hematuria. Past medical history included osteoarthritis, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, embolic stroke, and mediastinal thymoma with sternotomy and subsequent pleural effusion and empyema. Initial findings were as follows: temperature 36.6°C oral, blood pressure 142/95 mm Hg, pulse 106 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 98% while breathing room air, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Physical examination findings and results of laboratory analysis were reassuring except for an international normalized ratio of 5.5 and evidence of hemoconcentration. The patient was given intravenous (IV) fluids and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen and was then dismissed. Results of urine culture were positive for growth of more than 100,000 colony-forming units of Salmonella species 72 hours later.
Per protocol, the positive urine culture results were flagged and presented to the physician working clinically. On the basis of the patient’s prior presentation and the rarity of Salmonella in the urine, the patient was asked to return immediately for reevaluation. On return to the ED, the patient’s wife expressed sincere confusion and disappointment as she tried to explain how her husband, a hardworking man, was told to “walk it off” and that his irritable bowel syndrome was “just something he had to learn to live with.” The patient appeared pale and acutely ill with closed eyes and persistent moaning. Findings at presentation were temperature 37.2°C oral, blood pressure 102/55 mm Hg, pulse 93 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 95% while breathing room air, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Pain was rated as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10. Positive physical examination findings included flat neck veins, dry mucous membranes, healed scars on the chest, and left lower quadrant abdominal pain without tenderness or peritoneal signs, inguinal tenderness, or adenopathy. Sepsis work-up and blood cultures were ordered, as was CT because of concern for possible disseminated infection. The patient was given 1 gram of ceftriaxone, IV fluids, and hydromorphone.
CT showed a contained pseudoaneurysm in the descending thoracic aorta (4.7×4.0×5.7 cm) about 2 cm in diameter from the native aortic wall to the outer edge of the outpouching; it had a bilobed appearance and a total craniocaudal measurement of 2.6 cm for both outpouchings ( and ). The inferior-most origin of the pseudoaneurysm was noted about 3 cm above the origin of the celiac artery. Surrounding hematoma was seen on the descending thoracic aorta with inflammation and “old” hematoma settling down into the diaphragm.

The patient's symptoms began one day after eating grilled chicken and beef at a restaurant; however, she did not complain of abdominal pain, vomiting, or hematochezia. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the age of 50, had undergone haemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy for the past 2 years, and was under three times weekly haemodialysis. She had also undergone an aortic mechanical valve replacement operation for aortic stenosis 7 months prior to the current admission.
Upon admission to our hospital, the patient's height was 149 cm and her body weight were 61.0 kg (dry weight). The patient's temperature was 106°F, blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, heart rate was 152/min, and respiratory rate was 24/min. Cardiovascular examination revealed a Levine IV/VI systolic murmur at the right second intercostal space. Her bowel movements were slightly hypoactive and physical examination did not reveal any abdominal tenderness or rebound. No evidence of embolization including Osler node, Janeway lesion and petechiae was observed. No other abnormalities were noted on the systemic examination. Initial laboratory examinations revealed the following results: hemoglobin, 115 g/L [110-146 g/L]; total leukocyte counts, 10300/μL [3500-8200/μL] without left shift (Myelo 0.5%, Meta 0.5%, Stab 2.0%, Seg 90.0%, Lym 1.5%, Mono 5.5%); normal platelet counts, 1.42 × 103/μL [1.40-3.89 × 103/μL]; significantly elevated C-reactive protein, 18.54 mg/dL [<0.30 mg/dL]; Na 131 mEq/L, K 4.3 mEq/L, Cl 97 mEq/L, HCO3- 18.9 mmol/L; BUN 43.6 mg/dL, Cre 7.25 mg/dL (before haemodialysis); serum glucose, 173 mg/dL; and HbA1c, 7.3% [4.3-5.8%]. In addition, the patient was tested negative for HIV antibodies.
Salmonella enteritis or campylobacter enteritis was suspected due to the history of eating grilled chicken. Treatment was initiated with ciprofloxacin 300 mg q24hr, ceftriaxone 2 g q24hr, and clindamycin 600 mg q12hr intravenously, started on day of admission. Three days post-admission, a serial blood culture taken on admission revealed Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (O9, H-g) that was sensitive to ceftriaxone (MIC <= 1) and ciprofloxacin (MIC <= 0.25) (Table ). After detection of the causable microorganism, ceftriaxone and clindamycin treatment was ceased, and the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin alone. Since the patient's aortic valve was a prosthetic, and Salmonella species have a high affinity for intravascular intima, there was a concern about prosthetic infective endocarditis. Therefore, the patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on day 7; however, no abnormalities were detected by TTE. On day 9, the patient showed a sudden disturbance in mental status, left conjugate deviation, and right hemiplegia. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain via MRI showed an acute cerebral infarction of the middle cerebral artery region (figure ). Following this discovery, the TTE was re-examined, followed by a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) on day 13. The TEE revealed floppy vegetation on the mitral valve, which was 12 × 8 mm in size (figure ). We could not find any aberrance of the replaced aortic valve. Although surgery to remove the vegetation was considered, acute cerebral infarction contraindicated her from undergoing the operation. The ciprofloxacin dose was increased to 400 mg q24hr and was combined with ceftriaxone 2q q12hr, on day 12. Consequently, the patient was treated solely with ciprofloxacin for 8-day period (from day 4 to day 11). Although the patient's neurological deficit ameliorated gradually, she experienced another infarction at the left occipital lobe and the right cerebellar hemisphere on day 18. Conservative therapy with antibiotics was continued; however, her mental status progressively decreased and blood pressure deteriorated. Blood culture examinations were repeated, but they were all negative. haemodialysis ceased on day 35 due to the unstable haemodynamic status, although treatment with ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were continued. On day 39, the patient died of respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Her clinical course is shown in figure . Autopsy revealed a rigid node on the mitral valve (figure ), associated with septic emboli (mass of gram-negative microorganisms) at the left occipital lobe (figure ).",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [97.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [18.9, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [131.0, 'mEq/L']}",3.1,2.945,3.255,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 97.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 18.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.9 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.9 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.9 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.9 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.9 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 131.0 mEq/L - (97.0 mEq/L + 18.9 mEq/L) = 15.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.1 mEq/L.
Plugging in 15.1 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 15.1 - 12 = 3.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 3.1 mEq/L."

Furthermore, syncope or any other acute complaints were denied by the patient during the anamnesis. Echocardiography revealed a “low-flow low-gradient” aortic stenosis (mean transvalvular gradient 30 mmHg, aortic valve area 0.4 cm2, significant calcification), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, severe mitral regurgitation with moderate stenosis (mean transvalvular gradient 7 mmHg), with a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 80 mmHg.

Coronary angiography before TAVR revealed a severe left main (LM) ostial stenosis and sequential subtotal heavily calcified stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Fig. a). The left internal thoracic artery to LAD was occluded, and patency of a venous graft to the left circumflex (LCX, OM1) artery could be demonstrated. Her calculated logistic EuroScore I was 59.51% and the Syntax score 56.
Computed tomographic angiography showed no heavy tortuosity but moderate calcification of the iliofemoral arteries. The aortic annular area and perimeter measured 331 mm2 and 65.2 mm, respectively.
In our local heart team, the indication for protected high-risk PCI and TAVR was confirmed. Owing to concerns regarding potential hemodynamic instability in our critical patient with the combination of complex and significant un-revascularized proximal coronary stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, impaired LV contractility, mitral valve insufficiency and stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension, and frailty, it was decided to perform a combined procedure utilizing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) for hemodynamic support.
Our patient received general anesthesia in our hybrid operating room. VA ECMO was established by left femoral percutaneous cannulation using a 21-Fr venous and 15-Fr arterial cannula (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany). Via a right femoral arterial 7F sheath, PCI was performed accordingly. PCI was complicated by heavy calcification of the proximal LAD and the LM. After subsequent predilatations of LAD and LM using many non-compliant balloons two drug-eluting stents were implanted from the LM into the LAD in a provisional kissing balloon technique in LAD and LCX (Fig. b). Stent expansion of the LAD could only be achieved by using two OPN balloons (one ruptured) with 45 bar.
The right femoral 7F sheath was exchanged to the standard expandable TAVR sheath for the Sapien 3 system (Edwards, Irvine, CA, USA). The arterial pigtail catheter that is required for marking the aortic annulus during TAVR was inserted over a Check-Flo® Hemostasis Assembly (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) on a Y-adapter via the arterial ECMO cannula (Fig. ).
To reduce the risk of ventricular migration during TAVR, ECMO flow was reduced during valve implantation. A 23-mm Sapien 3 aortic valve prosthesis (Edwards, Irvine, CA, USA) was positioned across the aortic valve. After confirmation of ideal positioning via angiography, the valve was successfully implanted under rapid ventricular pacing. Transesophageal echocardiography and aortography depicted a good result without relevant prosthetic insufficiency (Fig. ). During LM and LAD PCI, and more pronounced during rapid over-pacing, significant ECMO support was indeed needed. Our patient demonstrated substantial hemodynamic improvement immediately after TAVR. After successful ECMO weaning, we performed decannulation in the operating room using the 18F MANTA vascular closure device (Fig. ). Hemostasis was immediately achieved, and device-related stenosis or bleeding could be excluded by crossover angiography. The right-sided TAVR introducer sheath was removed, and the arterial puncture site was successfully closed using another MANTA device (Fig. ). Our patient could be successfully extubated with stable respiration and hemodynamics without need for catecholamines. She was finally transferred to our intensive care unit for further surveillance and could be transferred to our intermediate care unit 5 days later. On day 18, echocardiography revealed an excellent function of the TAVR prosthesis with a mean gradient of 8 mmHg in the absence of any paravalvular regurgitation.",What is the patient's body surface area?

One week later, the patient presented with headache, nausea, and low-grade fever and was admitted to a local hospital. Acute multiple cerebral infarctions were diagnosed via brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and anti-coagulant therapy was initiated. However, despite continuing medical treatment for 7 days, consciousness disturbance developed and she was transferred to our hospital. At the time of admission, the patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 61 kg. Her body temperature was 37.4°C, her blood pressure was 145/85 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 66/min. There was no blood pressure differential between the right and left arms. The physical examination, including palpations of the lymph nodes, chest and abdomen, was unremarkable. There was mild edema in the lower legs. Neurological examination revealed mild consciousness disturbance with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 (E3V4M5), mild left facial paralysis, and bilateral positive Babinski’s sign. The patient displayed no motor weakness or sensory disturbances. Marked nuchal stiffness and a positive Kernig’s sign were observed.
The patient’s laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 12,100/μL with 87.3% neutrophils, C-reactive protein levels of 11.69 mg/dL, and D-dimer levels of 18.1 μg/mL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis disclosed 5 mononuclear cells/μL, a glucose level of 42 mg/dL (CSF-blood glucose ratio: 0.35), and a protein value of 46 mg/dL (Table ). An electroencephalogram revealed frequent bilaterally asynchronous sharp wave activities. Brain MRI revealed hydrocephalus, and high signal intensities in the right cerebellar hemisphere, corona radiata, caudate nucleus, and the left parietal lobe on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure A, B), with corresponding reduced apparent diffusion coefficient maps. No enhancement was observed in these lesions or the meninges on post-contrast T1-weighted images (Figure C, D). MR angiography showed intracranial vessel irregularities and stenoses of the right middle cerebral artery and vertebral artery. Electrocardiography displayed a sinus rhythm. Neither a potential cardiac source of embolism nor a source of the right-to-left shunt, including patent foramen ovale, was demonstrated via transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. A computed tomography scan of the chest detected calcification of the aortic arch. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin.
The subacute clinical course, marked nuchal stiffness, and mild mononuclear pleocytosis with a decreased CSF-blood glucose ratio (Table ) led us to consider meningoencephalitis due to tuberculosis or fungi; subsequently, antitubercular and antifungal drugs were administered. However, the CSF exams resulted in a negative cryptococcus antigen test and a low adenosine deaminase level (<2.0 IU/L). Additionally, CSF culture for bacteria, acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. The CSF cytology on admission revealed adenocarcinoma (Figure ). Tumor markers were within normal ranges. The chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography and gallium scintigraphy findings showed no evidence of malignancy. However, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy disclosed scirrhous gastric cancer, which was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma (signet-ring cell). The final diagnosis was meningeal carcinomatosis and excessive coagulation related to occult gastric cancer. Following discussion with the patient’s family, and based on the patient’s age, worsening consciousness levels (GCS of 6 on week 3), and poor performance status, she was transferred to the other hospital 22 days after admission, and supportive care rather than active management was administered.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Initial vitals were significant for blood pressure of 75/40 mm Hg, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, and temperature 98.4 F. Physical exam was remarkable for altered mental status, moderate respiratory distress, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Initial blood work before fluid resuscitation showed Hg 10.3 g/dL; WBC 13.9 K/mcL; Platelets 164 K/mcL; Na 133 mEq/L; K 3.1 mEq/L; Cl 110 mEq/L; HCO3−1 mEq/L; BUN of 23 mg/dL; Cr 3.2 mg/dL; Plasma Glucose 103 mg/dL; Total Protein 5.0 g/dL; Albumin 2.6 g/dL; Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) 737 U/L; Alanine Aminotransferase (ALA) 399 U/L; Alkaline Phosphatase (ALK) 99 U/L; Total Bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL; Direct Bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL; Calcium 7.3 mg/dL; Magnesium1.5 mg/dL; Inorganic Phosphorus 2.5 mg/dL; Procalcitonin 59.11 ng/mL; Lactic Acid 1.7 mmol/L; PT 17.7 SEC/INR 1.46; aPTT 49.2 SEC; COVID-19 PCR negative; SARS-CoV-2-IgG negative; Influenza Type A negative; Influenza Type B negative; Venous blood gas: pH 7.24, pCO2 of 24 mmHg ().

The patient underwent prophylactic right femur nailing with excision of a metastatic lesion and developed a fever of unknown origin, hypotension, acute blood loss, and acute tubular necrosis two weeks before presentation. At that time, she completed treatment with vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole due to a penicillin allergy. However, the infectious workup remained negative throughout the admission. The patient remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and safely discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility.
Four days after discharge, she presented to our emergency department for fever and hypotension. The team initiated the sepsis protocol, and the patient was adequately fluid resuscitated with an appropriate blood pressure response. Blood cultures were collected, and the patient received empiric antibiotic treatment and stress dose hydrocortisone with improvement in her mental status.
Throughout the hospital course, her functional status improved significantly. The patient again agreed to placement in a subacute rehab facility on day fourteen of hospitalization.
The clinical picture was suggestive of sepsis with multiorgan failure in the setting of a new RTA. The patient continued on antibiotics, maintenance fluids with lactated ringers, started on a sodium bicarbonate drip, and was admitted to the medical oncology service for further management. Working differential diagnoses included sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, antimicrobial toxicity, and immunotherapy adverse effects.
The patient completed a seven-day course of antibiotics. Infectious workup, including computed tomography abdominal and pelvis w/o contrast, urine culture, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), was unremarkable. While tapering the stress dose hydrocortisone, the patient developed transient hypotension, fever, and transaminitis episodes. Per discussion with the infectious disease team and primary oncologist, the thought was that the clinical presentation was likely related to immunotherapy.
Despite the acute renal failure resolution, the patient remained with a severe hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (HCO3−1, the nadir of 9 mmol/L), along with persistent hypokalemia (the nadir of 2.4 mEq/L) indicating a distal (type-I) RTA.
Although possible, antimicrobial-induced RTA was unlikely due to the resolution of the renal failure and that none of the agents are known culprits to manifest acid/base disturbances []. Giving rise to a suspected immunotherapy-induced RTA, the patient was started on prednisone one mg/kg and transitioned to sodium bicarbonate tablets. Repeat blood work revealed an appropriate response with downtrending liver enzymes and increased serum sodium bicarbonate, indicating a resolving RTA.
Further workup revealed a negative autoimmune panel (anti-Ro (SS-A), anti-La (SS-B), ANA). SPEP, UPEP, free light chains, hepatitis serology, and thyroid function tests were unremarkable. Alkaline urine, a positive urinary anion gap, a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with low serum bicarbonate, and persistent hypokalemia suggested a distal-type-1 RTA.
The patient followed up with nephrology and oncology as an outpatient. She completed a prednisone taper over four weeks and denied symptoms at the follow-up encounter.",What is the patient's delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [110.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [1.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Sodium': [133.0, 'mEq/L']}",0.435,0.413,0.457,"The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 1.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 1.0 mEq/L) = 22.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 22.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 22.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 22.0 - 12 = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 10.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 10.0 mEq/L / 23.0 mEq/L = 0.435. The patient's delta ratio is 0.435."

Past history was significant for repeated episodes of muscle weakness. At that time, she was diagnosed to have hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and started on oral potassium supplementation. Her physical examination was normal except for subtrochanteric fractures of bilateral femora. There was no muscle weakness of both upper limbs. The power in the lower limbs could not be tested due to fractures of both femora. On investigation, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl, BUN 26 mg/dl, S. Na+ - 133 mmol/L, S.K+ 2.7 mmol/L, S.

The urinary pH was 7.5. On radiological evaluation, there was an acute pathological subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, old subtrochanteric fracture of the right femur and left proximal fibula. On ultrasound abdomen, there was dystrophic parenchymal calcification in the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side. Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta acetic acid revealed nonfunctioning left kidney with the normally functioning right kidney. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal except for frequent ventricular ectopics. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. A bone scan showed avid uptake of tracer in right sixth rib, left seventh rib, bilateral proximal femora, left proximal fibula, shaft of the right humerus, and renal cortex [].
Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed to have RTA (distal or type 1, normal anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis) with hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and metabolic bone disease. Surgery was deferred in order to optimize the condition of the patient. The goal of therapy was to maintain serum pH of >7.3 and S.K+ >3 mmol/L. She was started on potassium supplementation intravenously (IV), followed by oral potassium 21 meq tid, tablet alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg, oral sodium bicarbonate 1 g (11.9 mmol) thrice a day, and oral calcium 500 mg BD.

She was posted for interlocking nailing of fracture of left femur to be followed by right femur after 2 days.
On the day of surgery, she was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet pantoprazole 40 mg 2 h prior to shifting to the operation theatre (OT). In the OT, standard monitors were attached and wide bore IV access was secured. Radial arterial cannulation was done for continuous blood pressure monitoring and ABG analysis. Under strict aseptic precautions, epidural space was located in sitting position at L3-4 intervertebral space through a median approach by the loss of resistance to air with an 18G Tuohy needle. A subarachnoid block was established with the administration of 3 ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine with 25 μg of fentanyl via 27G spinal needle (needle through needle technique). A 22G epidural catheter was passed into the epidural space and fixed at 9 cm. The time taken for onset of the subarachnoid block was approximately 5-6 min and the highest level of the block (T8) was achieved within 13 min. During the procedure, which lasted for 120 min, 1.5 L of ringer lactate was infused and normal saline was avoided. IV sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplementation were given based on ABG findings so as to maintain pH of more than 7.3 and >3 -5 mEq/L. A total of 50 meq of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 10 meq of potassium chloride were infused. Intraoperative vitals were stable, blood loss was approximately 300 ml, and urine output was 20-40 ml/h.

To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 122.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 122.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 122.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 122.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 122.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 122.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 11.3 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 11.3 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 11.3 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 11.3 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 11.3 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 11.3 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (122.0 mEq/L + 11.3 mEq/L) = -0.3 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -0.3 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 3.2 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. Let's first convert the mass of albumin from mg to g. The mass of albumin is 3.2 mg. To convert 3.2 mg of albumin to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.2 mg albumin * 0.001 g/mg = 0.003 g albumin. The volume units is dL so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 3.2 mg albumin/dL converts to 0.003 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -0.3 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.003 (in g/dL)) = 9.692 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 9.692 mEq/L.
Plugging in 9.692 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 9.692 - 12 = -2.31 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -2.31 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -2.31 mEq/L / 12.7 mEq/L = -0.182. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is -0.182."

She had been under maintenance hemodialysis for three years because of advanced diabetic nephropathy. At 70 years of age, she was diagnosed with stage IIIc ovarian cancer with carcinomatous peritonitis. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells were detected in the ascites. She received a simple total hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy after nine cycles of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by an additional six cycles of chemotherapy.
When she admitted to hospital, her blood pressure was 113/54 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.6°C. She was conscious and a physical examination of the nervous system revealed only positive Babinski reflex sign without any other neurologic abnormality including nystagmus. We could not evaluate her gait disturbance because her II-IV metatarsal bone was fractured during a fall that occurred several days before admission. In addition to the chief complaints, transient hypertension, headache, and nausea appeared during each hemodialysis session. Her symptoms appeared about one hour after the beginning of hemodialysis, and moreover, they lasted during treatment, and subsided gradually after the session. Thus, a diagnosis of DDS was made.
Findings from laboratory examinations were as follows; hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dL; hematocrit 35.9%; white blood cells (WBCs), 3,990 WBC/μL; sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium 4.9 mmol/L; chloride, 101 mmol/L; blood urea nitrogen, 56.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 6.24 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 0.18 mg/dL; B-type natriuretic peptide, 276.38 pg/mL; blood glucose, 137 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c, 6.7%; and normal liver function tests.
Both contrast-enhanced cranial computed tomography and non-enhancement cranial magnetic resonance imaging did not demonstrate any intracranial pathological abnormalities including mass lesions, bleeding, and metastatic disease. Five days after the admission, she presented with consciousness disturbance and short-term memory loss, which gradually worsened especially during hemodialysis. Cranial computed tomography images showed mild exacerbation of hydrocephalus (Figure ). Intracranial pressure at that time was 180 cmH2O (normal intracranial pressure: 60 to 150 cmH2O), and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, which were compatible with the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, were detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). NM had a negative effect on the patient’s general health. She died 42 days after admission.
Postmortem pathological examinations revealed cancer cells covering the surface of the brain and spinal cord (Figure ); however, no other apparent metastatic lesions were detected.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [56.3, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [137.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [141.0, 'mmol/L']}",309.718,294.232,325.204,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. 
The concentration of bun is 56.3 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 137.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 141.0 + (56.3 / 2.8) + (56.3 / 18) = 309.718 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 309.718 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 309.718 mOsm/kg."
7615,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-7985637-1,Extracted,"On February 27, 2020, a 71-y-old man presented with a purulent cough, mucoid sputum, chills, and sore throat but no fever. Two days after the onset of his initial symptoms, he developed fever (body temperature 38.0°C). He visited a public health center in Pusan on February 29, where a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was conducted at 8:00 pm. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 1, and he was admitted to Gimcheon Medical Center and placed in a negative pressure room.
The patient was otherwise healthy and did not take any medications. His height and weight were 173 cm and 83 kg, respectively. He was an ex-smoker (1 pack a day for 30 y) and had quit smoking in 2000. On the day of admission, the patient had uncontrolled fever with chills and myalgia. The physical examination results were normal, and there were no infiltrates on the chest radiograph (CXR). After admission, 2 tablets of lopinavir (200 mg)/ritonavir (50 mg) (Kaletra) were administered orally twice a day along with oxygen through a nasal cannula at 1 L/min. Additionally, supportive care, including rehydration with intravenous fluids and antipyretic drugs, was provided to control the symptoms.
On hospitalization day 4 (illness day 6), the patient’s condition worsened, and the oxygen levels had to be increased. Antibiotic treatment was started, specifically piperacillin (4 g)/tazobactam (0.5 g) intravenously every 8 h and levofloxacin (750 mg) intravenously every 24 h. On March 9 (illness day 11, hospitalization day 9), because his fever had persisted for 7 days and CXR findings had worsened, he was transferred to Pusan National Yangsan Hospital for intensive care.
On the transfer day, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: pulse, 74 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; blood pressure, 200/90 mmHg; and body temperature, 36.4°C. His oxygen saturation was 98% with nasal oxygen administered at 3 L/min. We continued oral administration of lopinavir (200 mg)/ritonavir (50 mg) twice a day and additionally administered losartan (100 mg) every 24 h and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg) every 24 h. Laboratory results were in the normal range, but CXR showed increased haziness and infiltrates in the right lower lobe (RLL). Furthermore, the patient reported mild amounts of yellowish sputum and intermittent cough and began producing blood-tinged sputum on day 12 of illness (hospitalization day 10).
The amount of sputum gradually increased and dyspnea symptoms worsened, causing the oxygen demand to increase continuously. Fortunately, the patient no longer had a fever. CXR showed pneumonia with increased infiltrates in the RLL compared with those on the initial CXR on hospitalization day 9. We maintained the oral administration of levofloxacin (750 mg) every 24 h. A week later, desaturation was observed even when the patient moved slightly. When he visited the bathroom, peripheral oxygen saturation dropped to as low as 86%. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at 4 L/min. The pressure of oxygen was 63 mmHg in the arterial blood gas analysis ()
RT-PCR tests were performed regularly, and the results were indeterminate on hospitalization day 13 (illness day 15) but finally became negative on hospitalization day 16 (illness day 18) (see ).
We decided to perform computed tomography (CT) of the chest because of the lack of change in CXR findings and dyspnea, despite supportive care. Chest CT showed multiple patchy areas of consolidation, mainly in the sub-pleural zones of the RLL, and GGOs in both lungs, suggesting a COP-like reaction (see ). We began steroid treatment on March 25 (illness day 27, hospitalization day 25). Dyspnea improved dramatically after 2 d, the oxygen demand decreased, and peripheral oxygen saturation consistently remained above 97%; oxygen was continually administered through a nasal cannula at 2 L/min. The patient was administered methylprednisolone (40 mg) from March 25 to 27, prednisolone (30 mg) from March 28 to 30, and prednisolone (20 mg) from March 31 to April 1. Following this, steroid treatment was discontinued, and continuous supportive care was provided. Chest CT at the 2-week follow-up showed a decreased extent of patchy consolidation and GGOs in both lungs, while irregular fibrotic lesions remained in the sub-pleural area of the RLL, indicating the interval resolving process of COP due to viral infection.
On April 9, all symptoms resolved, and he was finally discharged. After 3 mo, outpatient chest CT showed complete resolution of sub-pleural GGOs in both lungs (see ).",What is the patient's body surface area?

5585,26,Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-6953132-1,Extracted,"A 32-year-old woman arrived at the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Eight hours before arrival, with suicidal intent, she ingested 1500 mg of ipragliflozin, 800 mg of olmesartan medoxomil, and 640 mg of azelnidipine [a polypill of an angiotensin II receptor blocker/calcium channel blocker (ARB/CCB)], which was her mother’s medicine. She was treated with sodium valproate and chlorpromazine hydrochloride for her delusional disorder. She had previously experienced severe hypoglycemia in the event of an overdose of her mother’s medicine including an SGLT2 inhibitor along with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and a sulphonylurea.
On admission, her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 36.4 °C; heart rate, 47 beats/min; blood pressure, 66/26 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min and SpO2, 99% on room air. Except for slight drowsiness and hypotension, her physical examination was normal. Blood biochemistry showed the following: glucose, 126 mg/dL; urea nitrogen, 7.1 mmol/L; creatinine, 108 μmol/L; estimated glomerular filtration rate 42.3 mL/min/1.73 m2; sodium, 137 mmol/L; potassium, 4.8 mmol/L; calcium, 2.3 mmol/L; alanine aminotransferase, 32 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 33 IU/L and creatine kinase, 50 IU/L. Urinalysis showed the following: specific gravity, 1.029; protein, negative; glucose > 1000 mg/dL; ketone, 0 mg/dL; bilirubin, 0 mg/dL; nitrite, negative and leukocytes, negative. An arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH, 7.40; pCO2, 43.0 Torr; HCO3−, 26.1 mmol/L; base excess, 1.6 mmol/L and anion gap, 8 mmol/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal cardiac function and an inferior vena cava diameter > 20 mm.
The patient was admitted to the psychiatric ward because of her suicidal intent. Although she was treated with norepinephrine at 0.25 μg/kg/min, she still had hypotension. She was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) 20 h after ingestion.
After the treatment in the ICU, her blood pressure recovered, and we could discontinue norepinephrine as her blood concentration of ARB/CCB decreased 56 h after ingestion (Fig. ). The patient’s blood concentration of ipragliflozin was highest at the time of admission (9516.3 ng/mL), but her blood glucose level was normal. Thirty-six hours after ingestion, the blood concentration of ipragliflozin had decreased to 746.5 ng/mL, equivalent to the level of a therapeutic dose, and her renal function improved simultaneously. After improvement of renal function, the osmotic diuretic effect of the drug progressed and her blood glucose level declined. Her blood glucose level was at the lower end of the normal range, but continued to decline after 40 h of ingestion, so she was treated with glucose prophylactically. When glucose was added to maintain her blood glucose level, a marked increase in urine volume was observed (Fig. ). Crystalloid therapy was administered temporarily to treat the dehydration resulting from this diuretic effect. Unlike the previous admission due to overdose of SGLT2 inhibitors along with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas, severe hypoglycemia was not observed during the clinical course. She was discharged from the ICU 64 h after ingestion and discharged from the hospital on day 17.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [126.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [137.0, 'mmol/L']}",137.624,130.743,144.505,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 126.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (126.0 - 100) = 137.624 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 137.624 mEq/L."
3016,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-7575203-1,Extracted,"A 36-year-old woman who was 16-weeks pregnant with no known past medical history was brought to the hospital by her sister for 2 weeks of headaches and insomnia, followed by vivid hallucinations and bizarre delusions. Her vital signs at arrival were significant for a heart rate of 104 bpm, temperature of 97.60 F, blood pressure of 111/64 mmHg and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute saturating of 100% on room air. She was agitated, disoriented and speaking incoherently. Her cardiac and respiratory exams were normal. Neurological evaluation was limited as the patient was agitated and non-cooperative. Her deep tendon reflexes were +2 in bilateral upper and lower extremities. She was moving all extremities and reacted to pain stimuli. EKG on admission was significant for sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm []. CT scan of the head which was negative for any intracranial bleeding or intracranial masses. Arterial blood gas analysis, thyroid function testing, blood cultures and urine analysis were noncontributory [].
On day 2 of admission, the patient experienced refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures necessitating endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Evaluation with an MRI of the brain, MRA and MRV of the cerebral circulation did not reveal any intracranial pathology. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis []. Electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated an extreme delta brush pattern consistent with ANMDARE. ANMDARE antibody and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody positivity confirmed the diagnosis of ANMDARE. During her seizure episodes the patient demonstrated rhythmic oral grimacing and intermittent adduction of bilateral lower extremities. These findings correlated with the delta brush pattern seen on EEG. The patient required four anti-epileptic agents (phenobarbital, levetiracetam, clobazam, and lacosamide) to suppress the seizures. NMDARE was subsequently treated with 5 cycles of plasmapheresis, a course of stress dose methylprednisolone*, IVIG and rituximab.
During the course of her stay, telemetry identified sinus node dysrhythmias. Episodes of sinus tachycardia alternating (HR ~ 110–125 bpm) [] with sinus bradycardia (HR ~ 30–35 bpm) [] and sinus arrest (longest pause ~ 7 secs) [] related and unrelated to vagal stimuli (ultrasound fetal monitoring). A transvenous pacemaker was placed through the right internal jugular vein [].
Once ANMDARE was diagnosed, evaluation for a potential precipitating cause was undertaken. MRI of the abdomen demonstrated a left ovarian complex cystic structure measuring 32 × 33 mm. Given the association between teratomas and ANMDARE, bilateral oophorectomy was performed. Pathology identified hair and sebaceous secretions in the cyst and confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian teratoma. Despite treatment and oophorectomy patient currently remains dependent on the ventilator with poor neurological recovery at 32 weeks of gestation.

3007,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-6842506-1,Extracted,"A 72-year-old Dutch female presented to the emergency department with fever and concomitant confusion. Three years before this admission, a symptomatic MM was diagnosed for which melphalan, prednisolone and bortezomib were initiated. Eighteen months before presentation lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone was given for relapse of her MM, and 2 months later cyclophosphamide was added to this regimen. Six months later she progressed and received third line therapy consisting of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone. Four months before this presentation the MM was regarded refractory to bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs, thus immunotherapy with weekly daratumumab in combination with prednisone was offered. Although amyloidosis was suspected due to proteinuria, no confirmation by fat tissue biopsy was performed. One year before presentation an echocardiography showed no structural abnormalities of valves or heart. At admission, no (septic) shock was present with vital signs showing mild tachycardia (100 beats per minute), blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, temperature of 37.2 °C and respiratory rate of 15 per minute. History revealed fever, pollakisuria and confusion since 2 days. At physical examination no cardiac murmur, no signs of systemic major emboli, normal pulmonary auscultation and no signs for an acute abdomen or heart failure were found. No infusaport was in situ. Laboratory investigations showed mildly elevated leukocyte count (10.9 × 109/L) together with elevated C-reactive protein (127 mg/L). Kidney function, electrolytes and liver enzymes were normal. Immunoglobulin gamma was 31.4 g/L, which was stable over time and hypo-albuminaemia was also stable at 11 g/L. Electrocardiogram was unchanged when compared to 1 year earlier, without signs of arrhythmia, AV-blocks or myocardial ischemia. Pulmonary X-ray was normal. Urine tests were compatible with a urinary tract infection with positive nitrite and leukocytosis. Dipstick screening showed also signs of albuminuria and microscopic hematuria, which were not investigated further at this point. Intravenous amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (1000/200 mg 4 times daily) was initiated corresponding to Dutch guidelines for urinary tract infections. Hydrocortisone (100 mg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 100 mg per 24 h) was initiated because of suspected tertiary adrenal insufficiency due to prolonged use of prednisolone. One day after admission the results of urine culture confirmed bacterial growth of Escherichia coli. In contrast, all four blood cultures showed growth of M. morganii. Ciprofloxacin (200 mg 2 times daily) was added due to the penicillinresistance of the Morganella species. There was no evident portal of entry for the M. morganii, though no specific work-up was done.
Two days after admission, the patient acutely deteriorated with hemodynamic instability. Under the diagnosis of septic shock gentamicin (4 mg per kg) and once more hydrocortisone (100 mg bolus injection) were administered without improvement of hemodynamic status after 1 h. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe aortic regurgitation and a mobile structure, 10 by 10 mm, attached to left or non-coronary cusp, strongly suspective of vegetation (Fig. ). These findings led to the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis of the native aortic valve. Half an hour after diagnosis, the patient died due to ongoing hypoperfusion and refractory shock.
At autopsy, vegetation with gram-negative rods in the native aortic valve was observed, consistent with a diagnosis of M. morganii-endocarditis. Additional staining for amyloid confirmed advanced light-chain (AL) amyloidosis in heart, kidneys and spleen. The aortic valve itself contained patchy amyloid depositions near the adherent vegetation (Fig. ). These observations led to our hypothesis that the patient became susceptible to IE caused by the opportunistic pathogen M. morganii due to valvular endothelial damage related to amyloid depositions and a severely compromised immune system.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Heart Rate or Pulse': [100.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': True, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': False, 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False}",1,1,1,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

For further identification, we proposed other examination techniques for this patient, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) to better evaluate the left ventricular wall thickness and to identify potential areas of myocardial fibrosis, Holter monitor recordings and an exercise test to evaluate possible “dynamic” changes of repolarization abnormalities, as well as genetic testing. However, the patient refused all of these suggestions and was discharged. In the subsequent follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after discharge, the patient showed poor compliance and was eventually lost to follow-up.",What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.,"{'high-density lipoprotein cholesterol': [1.08, 'mmol/L'], 'Triglycerides': [1.42, 'mmol/L'], 'Total cholesterol': [4.01, 'mmol/L']}",98.78,93.841,103.719,"To compute the patient's LDL cholestrol, apply the following formula: LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL - (triglycerides / 5), where the units for total cholestrol, HDL cholestrol, and triglycerides are all mg/dL.
The concentration of total cholestrol is 4.01 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of total cholestrol is 4.01 mmol. To convert 4.01 mmol of total cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.01 mmol total cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol total cholestrol. To convert from mol total cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol total cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 1.547 g total cholestrol. To convert 1.547 g of total cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.547 g total cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 1547.0 mg total cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1547.0 mg total cholestrol/10.0 dL = 154.7 mg total cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 4.01 mmol total cholestrol/L converts to 154.7 mg total cholestrol/dL. 
The concentration of hdl cholestrol is 1.08 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 1.08 mmol. To convert 1.08 mmol of hdl cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.08 mmol hdl cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert from mol hdl cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 0.387 g hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.387 g of hdl cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.387 g hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol/10.0 dL = 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 1.08 mmol hdl cholestrol/L converts to 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. 
The concentration of triglycerides is 1.42 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of triglycerides from mmol to mg. The mass of triglycerides is 1.42 mmol. To convert 1.42 mmol of triglycerides to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.42 mmol triglycerides * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol triglycerides. To convert from mol triglycerides to grams, multiply by the molar mass 861.338 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol triglycerides * 861.338 g/mol = 0.861 g triglycerides. To convert 0.861 g of triglycerides to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.861 g triglycerides * 1000.0 mg/g = 861.0 mg triglycerides. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 861.0 mg triglycerides/10.0 dL = 86.1 mg triglycerides/dL. The concentration value of 1.42 mmol triglycerides/L converts to 86.1 mg triglycerides/dL. 
Plugging in these values will give us 154.7 mg/dL - 38.7 mg/dL - (86.1/5) mg/dL = 98.78 mg/dL.
The patients concentration of LDL cholestrol is 98.78 mg/dL."

The patient's cough has not produced any sputum. She also complains of alternating feelings of being 'hot then cold.' Whenever she coughs or breathes deeply, she experiences a severe sharp pain in her chest. The patient lives at home with her daughter and is otherwise healthy. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension treated with losartan and hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin. The patient does not have a history of tobacco use. Vital signs recorded in the office are as follows: T 38.7, HR 101, BP 135/78, RR 16, and SpO2 94%. Physical exam is significant for crackles in the right upper lung field.

Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are not reported and so we assume that this is missing from the patient, keeping the current total at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 0 + 3 = 3.
The patient's heart rate is 101.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5.
Because the patient has had an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0.
Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 6.0.
Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 6.0.

3990,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-5674842-1,Extracted,"A 30-year-old pregnant Japanese woman was diagnosed with GDM at 23 weeks and 3 days of gestation during her first pregnancy, based on the results of a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Her blood glucose levels before the test, after 60 min, and after 120 min were 81 mg/dL, 151 mg/dL, and 180 mg/dL, respectively. She was not obese before the pregnancy, had a height of 163 cm, a body weight of 54 kg, a body mass index (BMI) of 20.3 kg/m2 and had no family history of diabetes. She received dietary counselling, began SMBG (ONETOUCH UltraVue™ Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ), and successfully achieved good glycemic control until the day of her delivery (a healthy boy with a birth weight of 3164 g). At 3 months after the delivery, she completed a follow-up 75-g OGTT, and the blood glucose levels before the test, after 30 min, after 60 min, and after 120 min were 82 mg/dL, 146 mg/dL, 102 mg/dL, and 189 mg/dL, respectively. Her plasma insulin levels before the test and after 30 min were 2.20 μU/mL and 33.2 μU/ml, respectively. Therefore, she was diagnosed with IGT based on these results, an insulinogenic index of 0.48, and a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) result of 0.44. Thereafter, her HbA1c level was regularly monitored and ranged from 5.4% to 5.7%.
At the age of 33 years, the patient became pregnant with twins. At approximately 5 weeks of gestation, her SMBG began showing high postprandial glucose levels (up to 140–180 mg/dL), and she began self-administered insulin injections using insulin aspart (Novo Nordisk) three times per day before each meal. The doses of these insulin injections increased with gestational age, and reached 20–22 units before each meal. At 31 weeks and 3 days of gestation, the patient was urgently admitted to our hospital due to premature labor contractions. We initiated a continuous intravenous infusion (500 mL/day of 5% glucose solution containing 50 mg of ritodrine) that was continued until the day of her delivery. The patient experienced adverse effects from the ritodrine, required complete bed rest, and her glucose levels kept increasing (2200 kcal/day in 3 meals). Even with 25 units of injected insulin before each meal, her postprandial glucose levels increased to 211 mg/dL at 2 h after lunch, and she occasionally experienced hypoglycemia (59 mg/dL at 3 h after lunch or 50 mg/dL at approximately 10 PM). Thus, to reduce the fluctuations in her glucose levels, her food intake (2200 kcal/day with 59% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 26% fat) was separated into 5 meals: first breakfast at 8 AM, second breakfast at 10 AM, first lunch at noon, second lunch at 3 PM, and dinner at 6 PM. The patient also received 1 cup of yoghurt immediately before going to sleep (Fig. ). However, the patient subsequently experienced abdominal distension and difficulty eating, and we reduced her intake to 1960 kcal/day (Fig. ).
Based on the increased meal frequency, the patient required more frequent SMBG and insulin injections, which she found to be painful and depressing. Thus, we introduced the FGM system, which does not require finger punctures, to reduce her physical and emotional burden. During the first few days after its introduction, the FGM system exhibited discrepancies with the results from the conventional SMBG method, especially when her glucose levels were <70 mg/dL or >180 mg/dL. Therefore, she measured her glucose levels using both methods when her glucose levels were abnormally high or low. The patient also experienced difficulty consuming the second breakfast because of the short interval between the first and second breakfasts. Thus, her intake was revised to 1960 kcal/day (53% carbohydrates, 21% protein, and 26% fat) in 4 meals: breakfast at 8 AM, first lunch at noon, second lunch at 3 PM, and dinner at 6 PM. The re-distributed meals and flash glucose monitoring system allowed the patient to achieve good glycemic control, and the doses of the injected insulin decreased to 35 units (Fig. ) and then to 18 units (Fig. ). Her HbA1c level was maintained, ranging from 5.1% to 5.2% (these values were considered as a reference due to her anemia), and her glycoalbumin levels ranged from 10.6% to 11.6% during pregnancy. She gained 10.5 kg during her pregnancy and subsequently delivered twins via Caesarean procedure (2280 g and 2778 g) at 37 weeks and 1 day of gestation, without any adverse events or hypoglycemia. After the delivery, the patient stopped all insulin injections and had glucose levels of 70–140 mg/dL throughout the day with a normal puerperium diet (2200 kcal/day in 3 meals) (Fig. ). The patient and her twins were discharged in healthy states at 7 days after the delivery.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [163.0, 'cm']}",55.098,52.343,57.853,"The patient's gender is Female.

On examination, she was oriented and cooperative. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 150/75 mmHg; pulse, 84 beats per minute and regular; respirations, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 36.0℃. Clinical examination revealed diffuse pain in the right abdomen with tenderness. However, costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness was not prominent. Bowel sounds were increased.
Urinalysis showed 2 to 4 red cells and 0 to 1 white cells per field under high-power magnification. Complete blood cell count results were as follows: 8,500/mm3, with 44.5% neutrophils. Serum chemical analysis showed a urea level of 26 mg/dl, a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dl, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.99 mg/dl. Other values were within the normal limits.
After analgesic injection, her pain subsided. With a presumptive diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, she was discharged with medication.
The following day, the patient was admitted to the gastrointestinal department with persistent right abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed, which showed a dilated urinary bladder, hydronephroureterosis, and perinephric fluid collection. The patient was referred to our urologists, who recommended insertion of an indwelling Foley catheter. About 2 L of urine was drained shortly after catheter indwelling. Because there was no delayed phase on CT, we performed a non-enhanced CT scan immediately. It showed extravasation of radiocontrast from the right upper ureter at the L3 to 4 transverse process level and improved hydronephroureterosis ().

After 2 weeks, the Double-J catheter was removed and we subsequently performed a video-urodynamic study. A total of 500 ml of normal saline was filled in the bladder. The patient then tried to void with abdominal straining, but could not. Maximal detrusor pressure did not exceed 10 cmH2O. In other words, the patient showed detrusor underactivity and no vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). A follow-up CT scan was performed 2 months later.

After 2 weeks skin petechiae and ecchymoses appeared and the boy was admitted to an Infectious Disease Division. Peripheral blood count showed: hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, platelet 1 × 103/μL, white blood cells 8.5 × 103/μL, neutrophils 87%, lymphocytes 5%. ITP was suspected and intermediate dose methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 2 days. CT scan showed multiple masses both in the chest and abdomen, enlarged liver, and hypodense areas in the spleen. On admission to our center, clinical examination revealed obesity (weight 125 kg and height 171 cm), diffuse petechiae all over the skin and ecchymoses on upper and lower limbs. No enlarged peripheral lymph nodes were found. Liver and spleen margins were 2 and 2.5 cm under the lower costal limit, respectively. Laboratory investigation confirmed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10 × 103/μL) with hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL and white blood cells 13.6 × 103/μL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate measured 104 mm/h, reactive C protein 17.4 mg/dL (n.v. <0.8), lactate dehydrogenase level 1051 IU/L. Liver function tests including albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, coagulation parameters, and transaminases as well as serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were within the normal range. Viral serology for EBV, hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and HIV as well as autoimmune markers were negative, thus excluding secondary thrombocytopenia. FDG-PET documented high metabolic activity in all the sites evidenced as pathologic by CT scan. Leukemia/lymphoma diagnosis was suspected. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration and increased megakaryocytes, a picture compatible with ITP. A tru-cut biopsy of one of the abdominal masses was excluded due to adiposity and, consequently, it was decided to perform a laparoscopic procedure. In order to achieve a safe platelet value, a dose of 30 g of IVIG for two consecutive days was administered before surgery. Platelet rose to 30 × 103/μL and two units of platelets were transfused immediately before and during surgery.
Laparoscopy was complicated by copious bleeding and converted to open surgery. Bleeding was soon controlled with no further complications. Due to the need of respiratory and hemostasis surveillance, the patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit for 5 days. The platelet count fell to 22 × 103/μL and intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days) was administered with a prompt rise of platelet count (204 × 103/μL at day 3). Histological report revealed Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis type (immunophenotypic profile: CD 30+, CD15+/–, CD20–, CD3–, CD43–, LCA–, EMA–, ALK–). Chemotherapy was started according to AIEOP LH 2004 protocol, which includes 6 COPP/ABV cycles (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone/adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine) followed by involved field radiotherapy. Platelet count showed an asymptomatic second fall to 75 × 103/μL during the first course and rose up to normal values without the need of additional treatments.

Her sodium was 134 mmol/L (RR, 137 – 143), potassium 3.8 mmol/L (RR, 3.5 – 5.5), urea 8.1 mmol/L (RR, 2.6 – 6.4) and creatinine 142 umol/L (RR, 60 – 100), C-reactive protein 235 ug/L (RR, < 3), Creatine Kinase 1668 U/L (RR, < 125) and a random glucose of 22.4 mmol/L. Pelvic XR revealed diffuse gas formation extending inferiorly down the left leg (Figure ), further supported with computerized tomographic scans (Figure ).
Intravenous antibiotics including Penicillin, Gentamicin and Metronidazole were urgently administered together with crystalloid rehydration. Surgery was seriously considered but withheld due to the extensive nature of the infection. Not unexpectedly, the patient died of overwhelming sepsis in 12 hours despite rigorous and intensive medical therapy. Hyperbaric therapy was not available. Blood culture subsequently returned positive for Clostridium Septicum. Post mortem examination revealed extensive myofascial necrosis and subcutaneous gaseous formation (Figure ). Staining study revealed an abundance of gram-positive bacilli in the necrotic tissue supporting the blood culture finding. No bowel malignancy was detected.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [22.4, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [134.0, 'mmol/L']}",141.114,134.058,148.17,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 22.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 22.4 mmol. To convert 22.4 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 22.4 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.022 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.022 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.964 g glucose. To convert 3.964 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.964 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 3964.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3964.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 396.4 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 22.4 mmol glucose/L converts to 396.4 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (396.4 - 100) = 141.114 mEq/L.

The headache was described as a pain level of 8/10, throbbing, and radiating to the back of the neck. No weakness, numbness, visual deficits, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or lightheadedness was reported. He denied any difficulty in chewing or swallowing and denied any falls or trauma to the head. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and glaucoma.
His physical examination was significant for a nonfocal neurological examination, chronic poor visual acuity, and weak right palmar grasp secondary to his arthritis.
In the emergency department, his vital signs were as follows: height, 172.7 cm; weight, 72.6 kg; blood pressure, 188/109 mmHg; heart rate, 60 bpm; temperature, 36.8°C; respiratory rate, 18 bpm. The following laboratory data were remarkable: white blood cells, 8.8 109 cells/L; red blood cells, 3.04 M/µL; hematocrit, 30.3%; hemoglobin, 10.9 gm/dl; platelets 1,097 ×109/L; mean corpuscular volume, 99.8 fL; basic metabolic panel was notable for creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL and a normal glucose of 5.73 mmol/L. Coagulation studies were as follows: prothrombin time, 15.7 s; partial thromboplastin time, 33.7 s; international normalized ratio, 1.2.
His medications were famotidine 20 mg daily, amlodipine 10 mg daily, ultrashort-acting insulin 2–6 U subcutaneous four times a day, nicardipine, and lisinopril 20 mg daily. Initially, the management was focused on conservative blood pressure control and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. A subsequent head computerized tomography (CT) revealed a right intraventricular hemorrhage (), which was managed with platelet transfusions, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), and a nicardipine drip. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for frequent neurological examination and continuous blood pressure monitoring and control. The patient had an 11-day hospital stay and an extensive negative workup. Cardiac echocardiogram, vascular duplex of the lower extremities, and carotid duplex were negative. Follow-up imaging showed stable intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (), and the patient was ultimately discharged to Kessler Rehabilitation Center with zero neurological deficits.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [83, 'years'], 'weight': [72.6, 'kg'], 'height': [172.7, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [1.7, 'mg/dL']}",31.845,30.253,33.437,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 83 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 172.7 cm, which is 172.7 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.727 m. The patient's weight is 72.6 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 72.6 kg / (1.727 m * 1.727 m) = 24.342 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.3, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 68.382 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 83) * 68.382 * 1) / (1.7 * 72) = 31.845 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 31.845 mL/min."
2418,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-8489098-1,Extracted,"We saw a 59-year-old White female patient with a history of sarcoidosis at the outpatient department in early September 2012. On first sight, the left side of her face was significantly swollen, and she had pain in the preauricular area. The condition had started a few days earlier with swelling of the lips and progressed to left-sided facial edema and unilateral painful preauricular mass.
C-reactive protein was elevated at 54 mg/l (normal concentration up to 5mg/l). Transaminases, cholestasis and retention parameters, urinalysis, and microbiological findings were unremarkable. At this time, the patient was treated with 1 mg tacrolimus 1-0-0, 20 mg leflunomide 1-0-0, and 7.5 mg prednisolone.
For clarification, an inpatient admission to our tertiary center was arranged.
During the clinical examination, we saw a patient in moderate general condition and obese nutritional status with a body weight of 104.7 kg and a height of 168 cm. The patient did not show temperature elevation. Blood pressure was normal at 120/80 mmHg, and pulse rate was 80 beats/minute. On oral examination, the patient showed tender firm swelling of lips, erythematous and swollen gingiva of the upper and anterior teeth, and fissured tongue. In addition, there was generalized gingivitis, and the left side of the face was also markedly swollen and red. Furthermore, there was left-sided fascial paresis. There was no evidence of mouth sores, and odontogenic infections were ruled out. The eyes did not show any pathology. The heart rhythm was regular, the heart sounds S1/S2 were pure, and there were no heart murmurs. Examination of the lungs was without pathological findings. Pressure pain in the area of the abdomen could not be triggered, there was no organomegaly, and bowel sounds were unremarkable. Peripheral edema was absent on both sides, and no calf pressure pain could be induced. The joints were unremarkable. The neurological examination was regular except the facial palsy.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck on admission showed an enlargement of the left parotid gland with enhancement of contrast medium susceptive of abscess formation. Furthermore, on magnetic resonance imaging, there was a suspicion of a necrotic melting in the left parotid gland, which was displayed with a total extension of approximately 4–5 cm in the three spatial directions. The meltings are displayed with different signal strengths T2-hyperintense and T1-hypointense, and showed both marginal and septal internal contrast enhancement at this time. The findings further included the ramus mandibulae from the dorsal side and extended medially to the pterygoid muscles and laterally to the masseter muscle. The masseter muscle partially showed adjacent contrast enhancement with suspected inflammatory co-reaction. The angle of the jaw showed only small lymph nodes on both sides (Fig. ).
After surgical excision of the abscess formation and systemic antibiotic therapy, the patient developed soft-tissue ulceration in pre- and retroauricular area (Fig. b). A few days later, a left-sided peripheral facial palsy developed (Fig. a). The peripheral left facial palsy was due to swelling and inflammation from parotitis and developed independently of surgery.
No bacteria could be isolated from several wound swabs. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titer and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus were negative. In addition, a PCR for atypical mycobacteria was done, and again the test was negative. IgM antibody titer and PCR for herpes simplex virus were negative.
Histopathological examinations of the parotid gland revealed necrotizing tissue but also epithelioid granulomas. Malignancy could be excluded.
At that point, a systemic corticosteroid therapy with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days was given with no significant improvement of the soft-tissue ulcerations. Therefore, a parotidectomy was performed. Microbiological examinations on bronchoalveolar fluid were negative for pathogenic species. Serological tests such as tuberculosis were also negative. The patient did not report intestinal problems at any time that would have suggested Crohn’s disease. Hence, a colonoscopy did not seem to be justified.
This condition appeared under an immunosuppressive therapy with leflunomide 20 mg once a day in combination with 1 mg tacrolimus daily starting due to pulmonary sarcoidosis, diagnosed 2 years earlier.
The patient was known to have autoimmune thyroid disease with hypothyroidism prior to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. In addition, the patient had a history of kidney stone disease and had undergone surgery on the menisci of both knee joints. The patient has an allergy to amoxicillin, and did not have any pregnancies. She has never smoked or had significant alcohol consumption. There was no history of tuberculosis. The patient worked as a commercial employee and was continuously working in the office and not exposed to any noxae.
In October 2009, the patient had a severe feeling of illness with a body weight loss of 15 kg, bloody sputum, and a marked tendency to sweat. Bronchoscopy initially revealed chronic florid inflammation with epitheloid-cell-containing granulomas. Despite slightly elevated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA), there was no evidence of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Malignancy could also be excluded. From December 2009, the patient was treated with glucocorticoids, and as there was only partial remission in January 2010, the patient was treated with azathioprine for 4 months. Since there was insufficient improvement while taking azathioprine, therapy was switched to methotrexate in May 2010. Methotrexate was then used for a total of 11 months. With disease activity not adequately controlled, methotrexate was discontinued in February 2011, and oral cyclophosphamide was started after four courses of cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. After oral cyclophosphamide therapy, the patient was switched to tacrolimus and leflunomide in September 2011. Recurrent gingivitis occurred from summer 2012 onward. Beside recurrent gingivitis, the patient had orofacial edema and lip swelling as well as a fissured tongue in the past. The final diagnosis based on clinical and histopathological findings was MRS in the context of sarcoidosis.
After treatment with systemic steroids, the labial and facial swelling improved. However, the preauricular ulcerations did not respond to this treatment. At that point of time, the medication with clofazimine 100 mg per day was initiated, which was well tolerated. After 4 weeks of therapy, the tissue ulceration resolved gradually, so that 150 mg of clofazimine three times a week was given for 15 weeks (Fig. ). After that, clofazimine treatment could be stopped. During 7 years of follow-up, there was no recurrence (Fig. a, b).
During the course of the 4-month successful therapy with 150 mg clofazimine 1-0-0, the underlying disease was treated with rituximab. Initially, induction therapy was given with 4 × 375 mg at weekly intervals followed by B-cell and immunoglobulin-controlled therapy. Starting from June 2013, rituximab has been given in combination with 15 mg methotrexate once per week.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

5973,30,Serum Osmolality,lab test,decimal,pmc-3152516-1,Extracted,"A 56-year-old male with multiple co-morbidities, including a long-standing history of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, stage III chronic kidney disease, and congestive hepatopathy, underwent LVAD implantation two months prior to the most recent admission. He returned to the hospital due to persistent atrial fibrillation, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and rest, abdominal distension with ascites, and suspected ongoing hemolysis due to positioning of the inflow cannula at the apex of the LVAD.
It was decided that the patient should return to the operating room for placement of a new LVAD due to hemolysis and hypotension refractory to medical management. The night before the scheduled surgery, the patient was intubated due to worsening cardiopulmonary parameters, including increased work to breathe, and maintained on epinephrine 0.15 mcg/kg/min, norepinephrine 0.1 mcg/kg/min and dobutamine 3 mcg/kg/min. He was transferred to the operating room to replace the pump. Pre-op vitals included: temp 37.6 degrees Celsius, arterial blood pressure 64/50, mean arterial pressure 55, heart rate 118 and respiratory rate of 16. Prior to induction of anesthesia, labs included: white blood cells 15.2, hemoglobin 10, hematocrit 29.4, platelets 96, Na+ 130, K+ 3.1, Cl- 95, CO2 25, blood urea nitrogen 24, creatine 2.08, glucose 84, and international normalized ratio 3.5. Preoperative arterial blood gases were pH 7.48, pCO2 35.9, pO2 184.2, and HCO3 26.1. In the operating room, hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored via radial arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter. Induction was uneventful with etomidate 10 mg and cisatracurium 10 mg. The transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was placed uneventfully. The surgeons entered the mediastinum using the previous sternal incision. Once they began dissecting out the mediastinum, the patient became severely hypotensive and asystolic, and the TEE did not detect any movement on both the left and right side of the heart.
The anesthesiologist alerted the surgeon that Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocol was needed and the surgeon communicated that chest compressions were contraindicated due to the position of the inflow cannula directly beneath the sternum. The anesthesiologist recommended AO-CPR with manual mid-abdominal compressions 1 to 2 inches left of midline (left paramedian) at a rate of 80 beats/min with maximal force while the surgeon cannulated the groin to provide long-term mechanical support in the form of ECMO. As instructed, two members of the team performed AO-CPR (Figure ). During ACLS, the patient continued to be mechanically ventilated and epinephrine, vasopressin, and sodium bicarbonate were given per ACLS protocol, and the hemodynamic parameters as a result of AO-CPR continued to be monitored (Figure ). The duration of the CPR was 15 minutes, during which time the surgeon was able to cannulate the femoral artery and vein and institute ECMO support. The chest was closed and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient spent 24 hours in the intensive care unit on ECMO support and mechanical assist device. A decision was made to withdraw care after 24 hours and the patient expired.
Our case represents a difficult situation where the perioperative team faced a new challenge in the operating room: what are the alternatives to ECM when chest compressions are contraindicated due to position of the inflow cannula directly beneath the sternum? Neither the new guidelines published in the European Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery in 2009 nor the American Heart Association in 2010 provided alternatives to ECM for patients with a mechanical assist device.
It became evident that there was a need for an alternative to ECM, such as AO-CPR, to protect the recent sternotomy until re-opening of the chest to provide internal cardiac massage. The Interactive Cardiovascular Thoracic Surgery e-community conducted a discussion to address whether AO-CPR could be used instead of ECM to either protect the recent sternotomy or while chest compressions are not possible during resternotomy []. After reviewing this evidence, Dunning et al. [] concluded that AO-CPR theoretically has the potential to provide adequate systemic perfusion while an emergency resternotomy is being performed, but further evidence is needed before it can be recommended for routine use.
In general, coronary perfusion pressure during cardiac arrest is the difference between pressure in the aorta (from which the coronary arteries arise) and the right atrium (into which the coronary arteries exit). Using a mathematical model to describe the biophysics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with periodic z-axis acceleration or abdominal compression at aortic resonant frequencies, Babbs [] proposed that differences in wave mechanics, resulting from simultaneous compression of the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava, produced differences in pressure between the aorta and right atrium. During CPR, the minimal coronary perfusion pressure considered necessary for successful resuscitation with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is 15 mmHg []. The values for mean aortic and central venous pressure for our patient were 77 and 62 mmHg, respectively, which provided a mean coronary perfusion pressure of 15 mmHg (77 to 62 mmHg). In a study of 100 patients, however, conventional CPR provided a mean CPP of only 12.5 mmHg []; thus, we propose that the abdominal only CPR in our patient could have served as an effective bridge between the arrest and initiation of ECMO.
In our case, AO-CPR was unplanned, but the surgeon refused chest compressions due to contraindications in this patient. Due to lack of alternatives for resuscitation other than ECMO in this patient, the anesthesiologist suggested that AO-CPR be performed as a temporary resuscitative effort until the surgeon could successfully cannulate the femoral artery and vein to provide long-term mechanical support. Two rescuers performed AO-CPR with generation of coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) of 15 mmHg for 15 minutes, the duration of resuscitation. Both achieved results that appeared to be identical. The evidence seems to suggest that AO-CPR in this particular situation may be comparable to ECM in generating adequate CPP, but at this point it is still too early to determine the true efficacy of AO-CPR compared to ECM with regards to ROSC and neurological outcome.
Other evidence of adequate CPP generated during AO-CPR includes that from Geddes and colleagues [] and Pargett et al. [] who compared AO-CPR with chest compressions in animal models, and showed that AO-CPR was equivalent or superior to standard chest compressions at providing coronary perfusion. Neither of these studies reported any visceral organ damage or contraindications to AO-CPR, nor did they comment on neurological outcome. At this time, we cannot comment on the efficacy of AO-CPR on neurological outcomes as neurological status could not be assessed in our patient because he was intubated, sedated and paralyzed until care was withdrawn.
This case report generates important concerns. In our patient, even though we generated a CPP of 15 mmHg, which has been shown in some patients to be adequate, we do not know whether it was adequate to allow ROSC or whether the ECMO was responsible for ROSC. Other concerns are: what is the optimal delivery (optimal rate, depth/force, duty cycle and location of hand position) of AO-CPR in achieving successful resuscitation with ROSC, what is the best strategy for ventilation during AO-CPR, and is there potential damage/injury to abdominal viscera during AO-CPR?",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [24.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [84.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [130.0, 'mEq/L']}",273.238,259.576,286.9,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 24.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 84.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 130.0 + (24.0 / 2.8) + (24.0 / 18) = 273.238 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 273.238 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 273.238 mOsm/kg."

The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium.

The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 105.0 mEq chloride/0.1 L = 1050.0 mEq chloride/L. The concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/dL converts to 1050.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 22.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 22.0 mEq bicarbonate. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 22.0 mEq bicarbonate/0.1 L = 220.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. The concentration value of 22.0 mmol bicarbonate/dL converts to 220.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 1370.0 mEq/L - (1050.0 mEq/L + 220.0 mEq/L) = 100.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 100.0 mEq/L."

He had been diagnosed with hypertension a year ago and underwent pacemaker implantation due to SSS, complete AV block, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the same year. He had a dual-chamber pacemaker with atrial ventricular sensing, dual response, and rate-adaptive pacemaker (DDDR). In the preoperative evaluation, the electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed AV dual-paced rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). His heart rate (HR) was 68 beats/min, and QTc was 499 ms. PVC morphology has special characteristics of LBBB at V1, R/S transition in leads V3–4, and a tall R wave in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating PVC originating in the RVOT (Fig. ).[ Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal-sized cardiac chambers with preserved LV global systolic function (LVEF 64%) and normal valvular structure and function. The patient's pulmonary artery pressure was 37 mmHg, with no regional wall motion abnormalities. Moreover, there was no specific finding on performing coronary angiography. An adrenal mass was noted on performing abdominal CT and pheochromocytoma was ruled out.
Preoperative laboratory investigation showed no specific findings, with a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.8 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.54 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, and calcium level of 9.6 mg/dL.
Elective surgery was performed, which lasted for 4 hours and 35 minutes. Total time of anesthesia was 5 hours and 10 minutes. Preoperatively, the pacemaker mode was changed from DDDR to DOO (asynchronous mode). General anesthesia was induced totally with intravenous propofol which has anti-arrhythmic effects and remifentanil. Before intubation, 40 mg of lidocaine was injected intravenously, and 40 mg of rocuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. During the operation, the target concentration of anesthetics was maintained with propofol 2.5 to 3.0 mcg/mL, remifentanil 1 to 3 ng/mL, and rocuronium 5 mcg/kg/min. During the emergence, glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, pyridostigmine 10 mg, and sugammadex 200 mg were administered. The vital signs of the patient were stable during surgery; frequent PVC was not observed, and his blood pressure was between 100 to 130 and 60 to 90 mmHg. His HR was maintained at 60 beats/min. The total estimated blood loss was approximately 400 mL, total urine output was 630 mL, and total administered fluid volume was 2100 mL of balanced crystalloids.
At the time of transfer from the operating room to PACU, the patient had a noninvasively measured blood pressure (NIBP) of 138/60 mmHg, HR of 60 beats/min, and temperature of 35.5°C. Immediately after entering the PACU, the patient complained of sharp throbbing pain at the surgical site (abdomen) with an numeral rating scale score (NRS) of 8 points and received 50 mcg of fentanyl. Subsequently blood pressure gradually decreased. Due to the delay in transfer to the general ward, the patient stayed in the PACU for a long time. Ninety minutes after PACU admission, NIBP dropped to 80/45 mmHg. To increase the blood pressure, 400 mL of fluid and 4 mg of ephedrine were administered, but the blood pressure did not increase, and the patient was sweating; however, he was mentally alert. The NRS score in the surgical area dropped from 8 to 3 points. Furthermore, 400 mL of fluid and 8 mg of ephedrine were administered again, but blood pressure remained low. After 20 minutes, NIBP decreased to 60/40 mmHg. There were no skin rashes or symptoms of allergy (Fig. ).
Continuous dopamine infusion was started at a rate of 5 mcg/kg/min with fluid therapy; however, after 10 minutes, blood pressure reduced to 60/35 mmHg, and dopamine infusion rate was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min. Ten minutes after infusion, NIBP was still at 61/19 mmHg, and HR suddenly increased to 200 to 230 beats/min. EKG was performed, and monomorphic VT was observed.
The patient was alert but sweating, and his femoral pulse was palpable. Monomorphic VT with pulse persisted and the patient was in sinus rhythm for 10 second intermittently. However, within a few seconds, HR again increased to 200 beats/min, and monomorphic VT with pulse continued. Arterial cannulation was performed. After administration of 2 mg of midazolam, DC cardioversion 120 J (biphasic) was performed. HR was maintained at 60 beats/min, arterial blood pressure (ABP) was 50/41 mmHg after DC cardioversion, and continuous infusion of norepinephrine was started at a rate of 0. 5 mcg/kg/min. (Fig. ) in approximately 7 minutes, the patient recovered with an ABP of 95/60 mmHg and HR of 80 to 90 beats/min; the patient showed improved symptoms, was nearly mentally alert, and was sweating less.
Immediate pacemaker interrogation was performed, but no abnormalities in the pacemaker were observed. The pacemaker had a pacing rate of 60 beats/min, which eliminated pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (Figs. and ). The pacemaker mode was changed from DOO (asynchronous mode) to DDDR, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation. The total fluid administered at the PACU was 1000 mL and ABGA showed pH of 7. 31, PCO2 of 42. 0 mmHg, PO2 of 97. 6 mmHg, sodium level of 143 mEq/L, potassium level of 4. 0 mEq/L, calcium level of 7. 2 mg/dL and an Hgb level of 10. 4 g/dL. The total urine output at the PACU was 100 mL.
A 12-lead EKG which was recorded in the ICU showed no PVCs, and portable transthoracic echocardiography revealed no specific findings.
One month later, the patient visited the emergency room (ER) with symptoms of dizziness, low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg), and presyncope. EKG at the ER showed AV dual-paced rhythm and frequent PVC with tall R waves in leads II, III, and aVF, which was the same as frequent PVC derived from the RVOT observed previously. QTc was 495 ms. The patient recovered after supportive care, including fluid loading, and was discharged.

6106,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-3436703-1,Extracted,"A 28-day-old baby boy, born at term from an uneventful pregnancy and vaginal delivery (Apgar score: 9/10), was referred from a nearby town to our hospital after a week of irritability and feeding difficulties. He was a 3200 g. (cephalic perimeter: 38.5 cm), phenotypically normal infant, seriously lethargic, hypertonic, with intermittent lower right limb clonic seizures. His breath was superficial, and suck, grasp and Moro reflexes were absent. His anterior fontanel was bulging, and his cerebrospinal fluid was xanthochromic. Although serum electrolytes, creatinine, C-protein and blood cell count were normal, the child presented metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.18; HCO3: 15.5 mmol/L). Brain MRI (Figure ) confirmed a massive IVH with periventricular infiltration and hydrocephalus. Moreover, an II/VI systolic murmur, with upper arm blood pressure up to 178/94 mm Hg, and 57/49 mm in his leg, led to the diagnosis of aortic coarctation.
The patient’s initial course, under mechanical ventilation, captopril and phenobarbital, was favorable. Five days later, however, sudden polyuria (9 ml/kg/h), clinical signs of dehydration with unexpected weight loss (6%), and hyposthenuria (124 mOsm/kg), despite high serum sodium (156 mmol/L), chloride (126 mmol/L) and osmolality (326 mOsm/kg), led to the diagnosis of CDI. Subcutaneous (sc) desmopressin (0.02 μg. b.i.d.) achieved a rapid recovery (average serum sodium, 138 mmol/L; osmolality, 290 mOsm/kg). Surgical correction of his severe juxtaductal coarctation was performed 6 days after his metabolic stabilization. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed shortly thereafter. Due to the child’s severe deglutory handicap, sc desmopressin therapy was still recommended at discharge. The family was instructed to perform subcutaneous injection and daily diuresis and body weight control at home, and the patient was scheduled for periodic clinical and analytical (serum sodium) check-ups.
Four months later, the infant maintained a proper fluid balance. However, his delayed growth and neurodevelopment was progressively more evident, and his swallowing disability had almost led to malnourishment (Table ). He was scheduled for quarterly monitoring and nutritional support at his local hospital, under whose control he remained until two years of age. Throughout this period, his scant oral intake was supported by means of continuous debit enteral nutrition and he received desmopressin (0.1 μg bid, sc), phenobarbital (15 mg bid) and captopril (1 mg tid).
When he returned at two years of age, he had had no seizures, his ventriculoperitoneal shunt was working properly and, due to the fact that his food intake had been stable (though low), with no significant vomiting or diarrhoea, he maintained almost perfect fluid control. However, we saw a small, thin, microcephalic child (Table ), with very small developmental progress and whose deglutition had just improved. His serum sodium (146 mmol/L), osmolality (294 mOsm/kg), glucose (4.0 mmol/L), a.m. cortisol (292.6 mmol/L), free thyroxin (19.6 pmol/L), insulin (2.2 μU/mL) and IGF-1 (78 ng/mL) were within normal range, but his vasopressin was lesser than 1.1 pmol/L. His urinary osmolality ranged from 758 mOsm/kg (3 hours after desmopressin) to 226 mOsm/kg prior to the following dose. Given his unfavourable nutritional evolution, with insufficient deglutition, a gastrostomy was advised to provide nutritional support.
At the three-year check-up, the patient was under nasal desmopressin treatment (10 μg bid). This was recommended at his local hospital some four months before, when he underwent a gastrostomy, which unfortunately soon failed because of septic complications. Subsequently, the undernourished (Table ) and seriously delayed child (developmental age of about 9–10 months) got progressively worse: His fluid balance became quite unstable and, on at least two occasions, he suffered weight loss and clinical deterioration for several days related to a common cold. The family was informed about the risk posed by the probable dehydration episodes suffered by the child. The sc route for the desmopressin therapy and a new attempt at gastrostomy were once again recommended.
This advice was not followed, and at the age of 3 years and 5 months, the child was admitted to his local hospital after five days of a new nasal cold. His medical report registered a Glasgow Score of 8, body weight loss of 12%, and 189 mmol/L of serum sodium. After a few hours of saline infusion, he achieved a certain degree of clinical recovery. However, the next day he worsened again, and forty hours after his admittance, he entered into status epilepticus and was transferred to our hospital.
We received a sedated, malnourished child, with an irregular breathing rate and whose serum sodium was 147 mmol/L. Electroencephalogram and brain CT confirmed the suspected cerebral edema. After two weeks of intensive care, he was fully awake, but was quadriplegic, with hyperreflexic, spastic limbs, wrists in palmar flexion, bilateral Babinski sign, and a severely hypotonic neck. Central pontine myelinolysis was diagnosed; however, MRI were not those expected for this diagnosis, but rather of old hemorrhagic infarcts (Figure ). On discharge, desmopressin (0.13 μg bid, sc) was once again recommended and phenobarbital was replaced by levetiracetam (200 mg bid). Gastrostomy was uneventfully restored two weeks later.
Six months later (four years of age), sc desmopressin did maintain a fair balance. The deglutition ability of our quadriplegic patient had progressed admirably and his nutrition was greatly improved (Table ). His facial expression and babbling likewise evidenced some developmental improvement.
Despite his severe cognitive impairment, over the following year our patient improved significantly in terms of his cervical control, a useful ability to push with his left hand likewise being perceived. Poor, but increasingly disyllabic verbal expression and a significant capacity to understand simple verbal messages were also appreciated. As he had achieved an almost normal swallowing ability, his gastrostomy was closed and desmopressin was returned to the oral route (0.3 -0.35 μg bid).
At the check-up some days before his fifth birthday, he was an overweight boy (Table ).",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

He had suffered from traumatic right rib fractures 6 weeks before the referral. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission demonstrated a mass 32 mm in diameter in the anterior segment of the left lung (S3) (Fig. a) without obvious swelling of hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. The CT also showed right 3rd–5th rib fractures, which were almost healed, but the fractured ends projected into the chest cavity (Fig. b). Bilateral lung fields showed no emphysema or bullae. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT demonstrated uptakes in the tumor of the left upper lobe and the site of the rib fractures (Fig. c), and no uptake was found in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. The clinical stage of the patient was judged to be cT2aN0M0 (stage 1B). He had no specific comorbidities except for obesity and no smoking history. The mass in his left lung was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by transbronchial biopsy. Preoperative pulmonary function test showed a mild obstructive ventilatory impairment with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.67 L (80% of predicted), a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 1.84 L (68.0% of predicted), and 68.9% of FEV1/FVC.
After the induction of general anesthesia, a right-sided 37-French double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT, BronchoCath®, Mallinckrodt Medical, Ireland) was inserted. The position of the DLT was adjusted using bronchofiberscopy. The patient received volume-controlled ventilation appropriated for the physique. The tidal volume during OLV was set to 200 mL, and the peak inspiratory pressure with this tidal volume was about 35 cmH2O. The patient was placed in the right decubitus position and underwent left upper lobectomy under three-port VATS. Approximately 2 hours after the start of the surgery and during the closure of the wound, the patient’s blood pressure suddenly decreased to 50 mmHg. The arterial oxygen saturation of pulse oximetry (SpO2) and heart rate remained stable. The blood pressure improved immediately after the intravenous injection of phenylephrine. After placing a chest drain tube in the surgical side, a few minutes after the transient hypotension, OLV was switched to two-lung ventilation as usual. The operation was completed with the operation time of 137 minutes. The patient was rotated to the supine position, and portable chest x-ray photography was performed in the operation room, which revealed a right-sided tension pneumothorax (Fig. ). The DLT was located in the proper position. Immediately, a chest drain tube was inserted into the right chest cavity. A little air leak was observed through the right-sided drain tube, which fortunately stopped spontaneously by the next day. The right-sided drain tube was removed on day 1 and the left-sided tube on day 2 after surgery. He left the hospital on the 8th postoperative day.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [80.0, 'kg'], 'height': [162.2, 'cm']}",67.324,63.958,70.69,"The patient's gender is Male.

Symptoms began two days after her surgical procedure. Patient had a seven out of ten nonradiating, diffuse abdominal pain localized to the epigastric region described as burning in nature. It was accompanied by fever, nausea, and postprandial vomiting, which was clear and mucoid in nature, sometimes containing food particles. She did not have bowel movements since her inguinal hernia repair. Upon further inquiry, the patient mentioned that she had a decrease in appetite for all types of food for the past 6 months and began limiting her intake to liquids because they were easier to tolerate. The patient also noticed changes in stool caliber and noted an unintentional weight loss of 25 pounds in a one-month span. The patient stated that laboratory tests were unremarkable. A stool exam was not ordered since patient had no complaints of diarrhea. She had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed four months priorly due to similar symptoms and the results were essentially normal. The patient has a history of osteoarthritis. Surgical history includes umbilical hernia, a hysterectomy in 2012, and a left inguinal hernia in 2015. Family history includes diabetes mellitus and breast cancer. Patient is a retired home healthcare worker who resides in Grenada six months out of the year and frequently visits the United States. Patient has no other significant medical conditions and denies use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. In review of systems, the patient complains of feeling dizzy and experienced a severe bout of malaise beginning around the time she began to lose weight. However, no signs of fever, pruritus, or erythema were noted. The patient was asked about any distinctive food choices or habits and she states that she plants and consumes her own vegetables in rural Grenada.
Upon examination, the patient was an elderly female of the appropriately stated age; she appears apathetic and fatigued. The patient was malnourished and in mild distress with vital signs reading: blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg, a pulse of 110 bpm, a temperature of 99.8°F, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and normal S1 and S2 sounds were heard with regular rate and rhythm. The abdomen was soft, nondistended, tender to light, and deep palpation in the umbilical area but no masses or organomegaly was felt. Bowel sounds were normoactive in all 4 quadrants and a surgical scar from umbilical hernia was noted. Patient's left inguinal surgical site was tender to touch with mild swelling and no drainage.
The abdominal X-ray and CT were ordered and suggested evidence of ileus and dilated stomach with small bowel distended up to 4.5 cm diameter without identifiable obstruction, respectively. No organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was noted. Upper GI follow-through was performed and impressions identified jejunal mural abnormality with thickening and loss of normal mucosal pattern, suggestive of broad region of infection or inflammation. Laboratory examination revealed an unremarkable absolute eosinophil count and blood percentage ().
Patient presented with an elevated white blood cell count of 11,000/mm3 which rose to 16,000 mm3, following days of admission which is related to the infected surgical site (). Tumor markers for CA-19-9, CEA, and CA-125 were also measured and were within normal limits to rule out malignancy.
The patient was admitted for possible small bowel obstruction which was worked up with conservative treatment. Patient was placed on a regimen of nothing by mouth (NPO), lactated ringer 1000 mL intravenously at 125 mL/hr, NGT tube for intermittent decompression, and ketorolac 20 mg subcutaneously every 6 hours for pain. Another esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and the impression revealed duodenal mucosal thickening and diffuse redness. Biopsies were also taken: one sample from the antrum of the stomach and three samples from the duodenum which were submitted in formalin with the largest fragment measured up to 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.2 cm. Microscopic examination samples in the nonfundic type of gastric mucosal biopsy showed numerous parasites in the lumen of the glands (Figures and ). Parasite sections were noted in cross-sectional views and in other areas showing in long sections, which were identified as Strongyloides stercoralis. Eosinophils were identified in the infiltrate at 200x to 600x magnification, but a count was not taken.

1200,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-3079140-1,Extracted,"A 70-year-old man presented to our hospital with a two-week history of fever associated with lower back pain. He had a past history of recurrent infective endocarditis, for which he was admitted to our hospital in 2005 and in 2009. Streptococcus bovis was isolated during the first visit in 2005 as the causative organism of infective endocarditis. In addition, vegetation was found on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. During the second admission, blood culture showed the growth of a Streptococcus species. However, specific culture results were not reported. Similar to the first admission, vegetation growth was again found on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. On both admissions, the patient successfully recovered following the appropriate antibiotic treatment with reduction of vegetation.
On admission, the patient's core body temperature was 39.0℃, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, and pulse rate was 88 beats/minute. Auscultation revealed a regular heart beat with an early systolic murmur was found at the left lower sternal border (grade III/VI). Neurological examination was unremarkable. No peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis were noted.
Laboratory tests showed absence of leukocytosis (white blood cell 7,400/mm3), but mild anemia (hemoglobin 8.5 mg/dL), and thrombocytopenia (platelets 120,000/mm3) was noted. Except for a C-reactive protein (CRP) value of 4.17 mg/dL (0.1-0.8 mg/dL), no other laboratory tests showed significant abnormalities (blood urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 27 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 14 IU/L).
Chest radiography showed no pulmonary edema or active lesions in the lungs. In transthoracic echocardiography, a 2.7×1.4 cm sized vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve () was noted. Furthermore, moderately severe mitral regurgitation, trivial aortic regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation was also noted. Other findings included left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LV mass 270.5 gm), LV enlargement (LV end diastolic dimension 61 mm, LV end systolic dimension 41 mm), left atrial (LA) enlargement (LA dimension size 40.1 mm), and mild pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary arterial pressure 37 mmHg).
After diagnosis of infective endocarditis was confirmed, treatment was immediately started with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamycin, on suspicion of recurrent infective endocarditis.
On the second day of antibiotic therapy, fever and other signs of infection resolved. We continued antibiotic treatment for four weeks. However, blood culture demonstrated no growth of bacteria and fungi. Although his clinical signs and symptoms related to infective endocarditis improved, and CRP level decreased, his back pain did not completely resolve. Consequently, we decided to order a plain lumbar spine radiograph to evaluate the lower back pain, which showed disc space narrowing and endplate erosion of the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies (). Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was performed to further evaluate the erosive lesions, which confirmed acute spondylodiskitis of L3, L4 vertebrae and L3-4 disc space (). Pyogenic spondylodiskitis was highly suspicious to be associated with infective endocarditis according to the clinical course and patient's history. The patient was discharged after four weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment without complication. We decided to conduct follow-up evaluation of the patient's spinal lesions at the orthopedic outpatient clinic.
During follow-up at the outpatient clinic, the size of mitral valve vegetation was shown to be reduced on echocardiography (1.35×0.67 cm). There were no symptoms of infective endocarditis or pyogenic spondylodiskitis.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [130.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [80.0, 'mm hg']}",96.667,91.834,101.5,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 80.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 130.0 mm Hg = 96.667 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 96.667 mm Hg."
3828,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-3118944-1,Extracted,"33 years old male patient was referred to Department of Otolaryngology, Medical University of Warsaw, due to isolated longstanding hoarseness. At first visit weight was 98.5 kg, and height: 186 cm. The patient had no medical history (diagnoses or operations), was non-smoker and was not under any treatment.
In May 2005, the patient underwent a direct laryngoscopy. During the procedure, samples of the tumor located in right side of glottis were collected for pathologic examination. Due to indistinct result of the first histo-pathological examination, the direct laryngoscopy was repeated in June 2005 at the Department of Otolaryngology of the Medical University of Warsaw, where the tumor was subsequently resected and examined by a pathologist. A second histopathological examination revealed fragments of edematous mucous membrane partially covered with columnar epithelium, nondysplastic and paraepidermal in majority. In the stroma, active granulation was identified. Moreover numerous ""bizarre"" pleomorphic stromal cells and proliferating epithelial cells were identified. Due to the lack of correlation between the result of the pathological examination and the clinical manifestation, the slides were sent to The Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and the Institute of Oncology in Warsaw for revision and additional specification. This consultation revealed rhabdomyosarcoma embryonale. For treatment planning in August 2005, computed tomography (CT) examination of the larynx was performed with contiguous 2.7 mm thick slices and showed a poorly delineated tumor located on the right side of the larynx, invading the vocal fold and the ventricular fold, contracting the pyriform recess and constricting the glottis. Contrast enhancement in the tumor was observed in the CT scans (Figure ).
Due to the rarity of this type of tumor in laryngeal localization two cycles of VAC1 induction chemotherapy were administered (VAC1-vincristine, D-aktynomycine and cyclophosphamide: 1.5 MG/M2 IV day 1, 0.3 MG/M2 IV days 1-5, 150 MG/M2 IV days 1-5; every 28 days). The first chemotherapy cycle began on September 8th 2005. It was followed by chemo-radiotherapy in November and December 2005. Radiotherapy was administered in fractions of 200 cGy and total dose of 7000 cGy over 6 weeks. In parallel two cycles of maintenance VAC1 chemotherapy were given. CT was performed on the February 1st 2006 and revealed no tumor regression according to RECIST criteria. In accordance to CT scan no significant clinical response was observed. Subsequently on February 3rd 2006 vertical hemilaryngectomy was performed. Postoperative histopathological examination confirmed rhabdomyosarcoma located in the right side of the larynx. All examined margins were negative for cancer cells. The patient was discharged from the hospital with tracheostomy and nasogastric tube.
First cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy was administered on April 21st 2006. Chemotherapy was continued until August 24th 2006. In total the patient received twelve cycles of VAC1, with 50% dose reduction after V cycle due to neutropenic fever in November 2005. The patient had the nasogastric tube removed in May 2006 and was decaniulated in October 2006. Following the surgery, the patient was monitored by a laryngologist and oncologist and underwent regular fiberoptic examinations of the larynx and direct laryngoscopy in case of unclear fiberoptic examination results. Follow-up CTs were performed in October 2006, June 2007, November 2007, June 2008 and March 2009, and did not reveal any tumor recurrence (Figure ). Due to persistent swelling in the region of the arytenoid cartilage, a PET examination was performed on February 1st 2007. This examination did not reveal any focal lesions suggesting metastases. On March 2007, a check-up direct laryngoscopy with deep tissue biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination was negative. The patient remains under strict laryngological and oncological monitoring and no symptoms or signs of disease recurrence have been noticed. On June 24th 2010 patient had a follow-up PET-CT scan, which revealed normal glucose metabolism in the postoperative site (Figure ). No metastases or local recurrence were found until now (May 2011).","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [186.0, 'cm']}",80.424,76.403,84.445,"The patient's gender is Male.

His prenatal, birth history and neonatal period were unremarkable. At one year of age, he was diagnosed with polycystic kidneys. However, the parents did not follow up with scheduled appointments. He had no history of previous episodes of abdominal pain or jaundice. The physical examination showed an acutely ill-looking boy, with a protuberant abdomen, non-icteric, asthenic, and with evident paleness. His weight and height were 11 kg and 82 cm, at 10th and 9th percentile for age respectively. His abdomen was distended with an abdominal circumference of 56 cm with hepatomegaly of 7 cm below the costal margin and splenomegaly of 4 cm below the costal margin.
Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.8%, leukocyte count of 9460 /µL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 74 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 32 UI/L, alkaline phosphatase of 196 UI/L.
An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension (Japanese classification FIII) which were subsequently ligated. Serology for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Other negative test results included thick blood smear, latex agglutination test, anti-Smith antibodies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and liver and kidney type 1 anti-microsomal antibody (anti-LKM-1). His serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation index, and ceruloplasmin were within normal limits.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged liver (size 11.1 cm) with alteration in its echogenicity, defined borders, no masses or cysts, and a patent portal vein measuring 6.2 mm. The spleen was enlarged, measuring 9.4 x 3.7 cm, which appeared homogenous with no focal or diffuse lesions. The bile duct was not dilated. Both kidneys were increased in size, hyperechoic, and with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. There were no stones or dilation of the collecting system. A normal abdominal Doppler ultrasound and transthoracic echocardiography ruled out Budd Chiari syndrome.
Due to the inconclusive results of the abdominal ultrasound and Doppler, a computed tomography (CT) angiography and liver biopsy were requested. The CT angiography found significant hepatomegaly with a craniocaudal diameter at the level of the right hepatic lobe that reached 11.4 cm (normal 6-10 cm) and splenomegaly with a longitudinal diameter of 13.1 cm (normal 5-8 cm). Multiple intrahepatic images were found which corresponded to the dilated saccular bile ducts. Both liver lobes were affected, and there was no apparent obstruction. Dilatation of the portal vein was also observed, with a transverse diameter of up to 10 mm, and large esophageal varices. The common bile duct was dilated with a transverse diameter of 7 mm. Finally, important vascularization at the level of the hemorrhoidal plexus was observed. The concluding findings were highly suggestive of CD with evident signs of portal hypertension, vesicular hydrops, multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and polycystic kidney disease (Figures , ).
A liver biopsy revealed nodular liver tissue with marked fibrosis between nodules, which confirmed the presence of CHF (Figures , ).

The patient has no personal illness and no drug allergy. Throat examination reveals red enlarged tonsils with exudate (the patient did not allow taking a photo of her throat).
The patient has a history of repeated visits to the physicians for more than ten times per year with the same problem of acute tonsillitis. In each previous visit, the patient received penicillin as the antibiotic for the treatment, and the clinical problem was resolved, but the recurrence occurred within a few weeks.
The patient consulted with the physician in charge, who is a family physician, and gave the history that she was a prostitute and has to perform oral sexual intercourse with many different males. Nevertheless, she has no history of sexually transmitted infection, and her annual blood check, according to the legal regulation for the prostitute, for HIV serology and VDRL was negative. Furthermore, her annual gynecological examination result is within the normal limit. The differential diagnosis of recurrent tonsillitis in this patient is Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes infection that requires microbiological examination for discrimination. In this case, the tonsil and throat swab were done, and the microbiological study revealed gonorrhea infection.

She reported that she had a cervical epidural injection roughly 30-45 minutes prior to this event.
She described the headache as sharp in character, constant, at the base of her skull, and 10/10 in severity with radiation to the neck and upper back. It was not relieved by lying down. Her headache was also associated with nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. She denied having a history of fever or neck rigidity.
On presentation, her vital signs were as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP): 190 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 97 mmHg; pulse rate: 62 beats/min; respiratory rate: 18/min; and temperature: 37.8° Celsius (100° Fahrenheit). On examination, the patient was alert, oriented to time, place, and person, and was able to follow commands. Cranial nerves and visual field examination was negative for any focal deficits; extra-ocular muscles were intact without nystagmus; pupils were symmetrical, round, and reactive to light; the facial sensation was intact to light touch, and facial movements were full and symmetric with no dysarthria; the soft palate was elevated symmetrically; shoulder shrug strength was full bilaterally; and tongue protrusion in the midline with full side-to-side movement. On motor examination, the tone was normal in passive range of motion in the four limbs, power was normal and equal bilaterally, deep tendon reflexes were symmetric bilaterally, Babinski’s sign was negative with toes going downward bilaterally, no dysmetria in finger-nose testing, and she was able to stand without assistance. Sensory examination showed intact sensation to light touch in the bilateral upper and lower extremities.
Blood work showed the following findings: sodium: 136 mEq/L; potassium: 4.1 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine: 10/0.66; glucose: 182 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count: 21.2/L; hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL; and platelets: 289/L.
A head computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed newly evident pneumocephalus in the ventricular system and the extra-axial subarachnoid space within the sulci of the right frontal lobe (Figures , ).
The patient was then admitted with a working diagnosis of pneumocephalus most likely in the setting of traumatic cervical epidural injection.
Pain control was done with butalbital (50 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg)/caffeine (40 mg) oral tablet, with Dilaudid and ketorolac as needed. Oxygen supplementation was done with the help of a non-rebreather mask connected to 15 liters of oxygen, which was gradually tapered down to 6 liters via a high-flow nasal cannula after 24 hours.
Cervical and thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging was performed with and without contrast to rule out epidural abscesses that showed multiple levels of spondylosis mainly prevalent in C4-C7 without evidence of epidural fluid collection.

The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mEq. To convert from 136.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 10.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 182.0 mg/dL.

Two years prior to admission she had underwent an abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids, which were complicated by symptomatic anemia from associated menorrhagia. Two months prior to admission, she sustained a brief loss of consciousness, then two weeks before admission she developed gradual onset of pleuritic chest pain and lower extremity edema. One day prior to admission, she complained of some shortness of breath and a non-productive cough. There were no known risk factors or family history of thromboembolism. She had no other significant past medical, surgical or obstetric history. She was a non-smoker, non-alcoholic and denied use of illicit substances. She had no history of drug allergy.
On the day of admission, she developed dizziness at home and fell to the ground. Her family helped her to bed wherein she had a witnessed four-minute period of loss of consciousness. She was taken by ambulance to an outside hospital where she appeared cyanotic and hypotensive with a weak pulse, was immediately sedated, endotracheally intubated and started on intravenous norepinephrine. Physical examination, prior to intubation, revealed a dusky blue skin suggestive of cyanosis. She had a tachycardia with pulse rate of 110 per minute, hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg and tachypnea with respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. There was teeth clenching and hypersalivation. An electrocardiogram and serum troponin levels were normal, her initial arterial blood pH was 7.25 with a PCO2 of 2.93 kPa (22 mmHg) and a PO2 of 67.46 kPa (506 mmHg) on an inspired fraction of oxygen of 1.0.

The serum bicarbonate was 14.6 mmol/L while other serum chemistries, renal and liver function tests were unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was normal. A venous duplex ultrasound scan showed the presence of a right lower extremity proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) extending to the groin and she was commenced on intravenous standard unfractionated heparin.
Later that day the patient was transferred to our hospital where a pulmonary embolism protocol computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax and pelvis (, , ) and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram were performed (). Because of the positive venous duplex ultrasound finding of a DVT, a D-Dimer was not requested.
The patient was seen by a pulmonologist who made a differential diagnosis of an intracardiac tumor thrombus versus a thromboembolism-in-transit, and advised a surgical opinion. Because of delays in obtaining a concensus on appropriate surgical management from the cardiothoracic, vascular and gynecologic surgeons together with the need for further imaging studies, ongoing hypotension, presumed transient complete occlusion of the tricuspid valve and a confirmed deep venous thrombosis, the patient was initially thrombolysed intravenously with 100 mg of tissue plasminogen activator to treat any life-threatening component of venous thrombosis. Following this, the patient’s hemodynamic indices improved only slightly. The next day, the patient underwent a joint procedure with single stage median sternotomy and exploratory laparotomy, extraction of an inferior vena cava, common iliac vein and right atrial tumor thrombus, and included bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The histopathology of the tumor was consistent with leiomyoma ().

5280,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-5075604-1,Extracted,"After HIV infection was diagnosed, an 8-month-old boy with worsening pneumonia and respiratory distress was transferred to the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia (UHID), on November 4, 2011. The child had previously been hospitalized two times in his local hospital for diarrhoea and pneumonia. His mother had not been tested for HIV while pregnant. There was no family history of tuberculosis (TB), but immunization with Statens Serum Institut (Danish strain) BCG vaccine at birth had left a nonhealing ulcer on the deltoid region of the left arm.
On presentation, the infant was receiving mechanical ventilation and was overall in poor condition. He weighed 7.4 kg and was 42.5 cm long. On physical examination he had tachycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, and oedema of the lower extremities. There was also an ulcer at the site of BCG immunization with a palpable ipsilateral 1 cm axillary lymph node. His chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates with a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Results of laboratory studies on admission showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 5 mm per first hour, serum procalcitonin level of 0.844 µg/L, hemoglobin concentration of 130 g/L, leukocyte count of 10.4 × 109/L, and platelet count of 51 × 109/L. His CD4 cell count was 5.9% (24 cells per µL) and his plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.96 million copies/mL. An overview of the major clinical and laboratory findings is presented on .
He was immediately given high-dose co-trimoxazole and steroids for presumed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia as well as piperacillin-tazobactam for probable hospital acquired infection. Anti-TB therapy consisting of isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampicin, which had been started the day before transfer to our hospital, was continued. On the third hospital day at UHID he developed signs of hepatitis; his serum bilirubin climbed to 116.5 µmol/L (conjugated bilirubin 66.9 µmol/L), his aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 1952 IU/L, his alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 365 IU/L, and his lactate dehydrogenase level was 2948 IU/L. His prothrombin time was prolonged (international normalized ratio value 2.7). All TB medications were stopped and liver function tests gradually returned to normal over the next three weeks.
Tracheal aspirate taken on the day of admission was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA on polymerase chain reaction and also grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa on culture. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was started two weeks after admission to UHID with a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. There was no HIV drug resistance found in the blood sample obtained prior to initiation of ART. Steroids were stopped after 21 days of therapy and at that point co-trimoxazole was switched to a prophylactic oral dose. The breathing had significantly improved so he was weaned from mechanical ventilation 4 weeks after admission to our hospital. We performed an interferon-gamma release assay (QuantiFERON®); the result was negative. In light of the clinical improvement and prior signs of severe, presumably toxic hepatitis, the decision was made not to give TB treatment.
Two months after admission an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple small (up to 8 mm) hypoechogenic splenic lesions. Two weeks later signs of BCG infection were again present with prominent ipsilateral axillary lymph node enlargement. An attempt was made to restart anti-TB medications. However, an urticarial rash developed after isoniazid was started, so the drug was discontinued; the patient was treated with amikacin for one week and clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and prednisolone for 4 weeks. This treatment regimen led to regression in lymph node size. At this time, zidovudine was replaced by abacavir due to anaemia ().
In the fourth month of care, the child developed multiple skin lesions on his head and limbs that started as erythematous papules and turned into subcutaneous abscesses. A repeated QuantiFERON test was now positive. Mycobacterial cultures from the disseminated skin lesions were taken and subsequently grew M. bovis. At this point we learned that mycobacterial cultures from the site of BCG application (left deltoid muscle) and tracheal aspirate were taken at the local hospital about one week prior to transfer to our hospital. These cultures also grew M. bovis, but the staff at UHID was not aware of the positive results. Initially the samples were cultured on solid (Loewenstein and Stonebrink) and liquid MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube, the BD BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 System) media. The identification of the cultured M. bovis BCG strain was done using the commercially available line probe assay, GenoType MTBC Kit (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany).
Drugs with antimycobacterial activity (amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin) were reintroduced (). Multiple cystic bone lesions were noted in the skull and in the bones of both arms, both hands, and both legs (). As fever and skin lesions persisted, ethambutol, linezolid (10–12 mg/kg orally three times per day), and isoniazid were sequentially added to his anti-TB regimen (). This time neither rash nor toxic hepatitis developed. Because we wanted to give rifampicin again and rifabutin was not available at that time, we replaced lopinavir/ritonavir with nevirapine. However, two weeks later there was an increase in serum liver enzymes (AST 113 IU/L and ALT 122 IU/L), so nevirapine was stopped and standard dose lopinavir/ritonavir was reintroduced. Amikacin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ethambutol were discontinued as shown in . After a 10-month hospital stay the patient was discharged on linezolid, isoniazid, abacavir, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir.
However, fever reappeared, new skin lesions were still developing, and bone lesions were growing. A bone biopsy of the right tibia was done on 12th month of care at UHID (). Histopathological findings revealed inflammatory tissue with microscopic characteristics of granulomata and foci of necrosis, which grew acid-fast bacilli identified as M. bovis. At this point ethambutol and rifabutin (dosed at 5 mg/kg three times per week) were added to the TB regimen, and after six weeks the frequency of rifabutin dosing was increased to daily administration (once daily 7 days per week) (). After rifabutin was given dosed at 5 mg/kg/day every day the patient remained without fever. The child's complete blood count was monitored; after rifabutin was given 3 times weekly his lowest observed leukocyte count was 4.1 × 109/L with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.3 × 109/L (1300 per µL) on the 18th day of administration. After rifabutin was given daily, the lowest leukocyte count was observed after one month of therapy (1.9 × 109/L with an ANC of 0.7 × 109/L (700 per µL)). However, this neutropenia was transient; after six days the ANC was 3300 per µL without any intervention. Since the response to ART was not optimal (), a resistance test was done which showed reverse transcriptase mutations associated with nevirapine (Y181C) and lamivudine (M184V) resistance (16th month of care). To optimize the virological response to ART, abacavir was replaced by zidovudine and raltegravir granules were added to the antiretroviral regimen. After 16 months in care a skin lesion and a lymph node aspirate failed to grow mycobacteria for the first time, and one month later the child became consistently afebrile. At this point ethambutol treatment had reached 6 months, and it was discontinued. Two months later linezolid was stopped after a total of 13 months of therapy. At follow-up 12 months from the first negative skin lesion culture the child was clinically stable and radiographs of the lower limb showed signs of bone healing. Anti-TB therapy was stopped at this time (). The child reached an undetectable HIV-1 RNA viral load measured by the Abbott assay (detection limit 40 copies/mL) only after 36 months of ART on a regimen of tenofovir, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and raltegravir.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [7.4, 'kg']}",29.6,28.12,31.08,"The patient's weight is 7.4 kg.

She was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery to healthy parents having no consanguinity. She had no history of drug or alcohol intake. She had no physical findings suggesting a liver disorder, such as hepatosplenomegaly or jaundice. Vital signs and neurologic findings were normal. Height, body weight, and body mass index, respectively, were 158 cm (+0.4 SD), 67.4 kg (+2.2 SD), and 27 kg/m2 (normal range, 18.5–24.9).
Initial laboratory results included serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 160 U/L (normal range, <33); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 338 U/L (<30); γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), 99 U/L (<47); total/direct bilirubin, 0.96/0.09 mg/dL (<1.2/<0.6); albumin, 4.6 g/dL (4.0–5.0); total bile acids, 2.7 μmol/L (<10); type IV collagen, 133.0 ng/mL (<140); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 132 mg/dL (<139); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 48 mg/dL (>40); fasting plasma glucose 95 mg/dL (<109); HbA1c 5.5% (4.9–6.0); and prothrombin time–international normalized ratio, 0.89 (0.87–1.25). The complete blood cell count was normal. Various causes of chronic liver disease such as autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis, and other metabolic conditions were excluded by appropriate laboratory tests. Abdominal ultrasonography showed fatty liver (ultrasonographic grade 3), with a marked increase in fine echoes and little or no visualization of intrahepatic vessel outlines, the diaphragm, and the posterior right lobe of the liver (Table ).[ Liver biopsy was not performed because signs of steatohepatitis with fibrosis such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, cholestasis, and elevation of serum type IV collagen all were absent.
We clinically diagnosed the patient with NAFLD and obesity, to be treated with diet and exercise. However, body weight increased. As breast enlargement at 11 years and pubic hair growth at 12 years were neither accompanied nor followed by menstruation, endocrine functions were assessed. Luteinizing hormone was <0.2 mIU/mL (0.05–2.44); follicle-stimulating hormone, 1.9 mIU/mL (0.92–3.29); free thyroxine, 0.98 ng/dL (0.93–1.70); thyroid-stimulating hormone, 0.94 μIU/mL (0.50–5.00); estradiol, <25 pg/mL (<42.8); and prolactin, 485.6 ng/mL (4.1–28.9).

He presented to the hospital emergency room with severe neck pain, bleeding from the mouth, and a deep lacerated injury on the right side of his jaw and upper part of the neck, with surgical emphysema (). His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was E4V5M5, and his pupils were bilaterally equal and 2 mm in size. His initial recorded vital signs were: blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, heart rate of 100 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18/min, and SpO2 of 93% in room air. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of his facial bones and upper cervical spine revealed a comminuted displaced fracture, which involved the angle and body of the right hemimandible, with adjacent soft tissue laceration, hematoma, and air pockets (). There was a displaced comminuted fracture of the right transverse process of the atlas that extended into the right lateral mass, and a fracture of the right occipital condyle that extended to the foramen transversarium margin (). The atlas was rotated, with displacement of the atlanto-occipital and atlanto axial joints. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of neck showed the absence of right vertebral artery flow void and a thrombus in the right vertebral artery (). Bilateral vertebral artery Doppler was performed, which showed right vertebral artery flow stasis, indicating a thrombus. The nasal bones, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and laryngeal cartilages were normal. There was no intracranial injury and no involvement of the spinal cord; hence, no sensory motor deficits or bladder or bowel involvement were identified. A thin pre-vertebral hematoma was seen extending from level C1 to C4, and the rest of the cervical vertebrae were normal. Since the inner cortex of the mandible was comminuted and shattered, the right inferior alveolar artery was cut completely, with bleeding into the oral cavity. Mouth opening was restricted, and the inter incisor distance was 1 cm.
After the neck wound was covered with dressing, a cervical collar was applied. The patient was admitted to the high dependency unit (HDU); and after proper explanation of the anesthetic and surgical plan to the patient and his guardian, he underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the mandible and exploration of the neck injury the next day. His basal oxygen saturation was at 95%, and an arterial blood gas analysis in room air revealed a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 110 mmHg, bicarbonate level of 22 mmol/L, and arterial oxygen saturation of 98%. His blood investigations revealed hemoglobin levels of 11.9 gm%, platelets of 2.04 lakhs/mm3, serum urea of 22.0 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, serum glucose of 93 mg/dL, sodium of 140 meq/dL, and potassium of 3.9 meq/dL. A large bore intravenous cannula was inserted into the dorsum of the left hand, and ringer lactate was started. He was connected to a multipara monitor that displayed his electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, endtidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and core temperature. The ECG showed a sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 92/min and a normal axis, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg and respiratory rate of 14/min. Glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) was given intravenously. An awake fiber-optic nasotracheal intubation was planned, with a backup emergency surgical airway kit in case the first method failed. The nasal cavity was anesthetized by packing with cotton tape gauze soaked in 2% lidocaine and 0.05% oxymetazoline hydrochloride, and the oropharynx was nebulized with 2% lidocaine spray. The larynx and trachea were anaesthetized by nebulization with lignocaine, and supplemental oxygen was administered via a nasal catheter. A 5.5 mm fiber-optic bronchoscope was taken, and a 7.0 mm size cuffed reinforced endotracheal tube was slid up the full length of the shaft and gently secured to the beveled end of the bronchoscope.
The oral cavity was full of clots as the right inferior alveolar artery was cut. The oral cavity was intermittently cleared, to enable clear visualization. The fiber-optic bronchoscope was introduced into the left nasal cavity and gently advanced through the glottis into the trachea to just above the carina. Then, the endotracheal tube was gently railroaded and advanced into the trachea. Successful placement of the tube in the trachea was verified by capnography and bilateral equal air entry. The cuff was inflated to seal the airway, and the tube was securely fixed. Fentanyl (50 µg, 1 µg/kg), propofol (80 mg), and atracurium (25 mg) were given intravenously. A throat pack was inserted gently through the available inter incisor space. Anesthesia was maintained using a mixture of 50% oxygen, 50% nitrous oxide, and 1–1.5% isoflurane, with intermittent doses of atracurium. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was instituted, and ETCO2 was maintained at 35 mm Hg. The perioperative period was uneventful, without significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate (systolic pressure 110–130 mmHg, diastolic pressure 70–86 mmHg, heart rate 85–108 beats/min). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained between 90 to 100 mmHg to maintain perfusion and reduce the risk of posterior circulation ischemia. A total of 1000 mL of crystalloids was given perioperatively. At the end of the procedure, which lasted 90 minutes, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine (2.5 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg), which were given intravenously. The throat pack was removed and the trachea was extubated when the patient was awake with protective airway reflexes, and the neuromuscular transmission recovered to a train of four (TOF) ratio of 0.9. Paracetamol (1,000 mg) was given intravenously for postoperative analgesia, and ondansetron (4 mg) was given intravenously for antiemetic prophylaxis. The patient was transferred to the HDU for observation, and he made an uneventful recovery and was started on IV antibiotics and enoxaparin for anticoagulation, 48 hours following surgery for one week, to establish vertebral artery flow. This was later replaced with oral aspirin.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 139.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 139.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 139.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 47.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 47.0 mEq/L) = -18.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -18.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in -18.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get -18.0 - 12 = -30.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -30.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -30.0 mEq/L / -23.0 mEq/L = 1.304. The patient's delta ratio is 1.304."
8874,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-2651857-1,Extracted,"A 43-years-old woman, born in Ukraine, living and working in Italy since 1999 (nine years), came to observation of the First Aid Unit of Ferrara Hospital in March 2008, due to an epileptic seizure with generalized convulsions which occurred while she was working as assistant for a patient of the Pneumology Unit, in the same Hospital. She was found by the nurses of the ward, prone on the floor, unresponsive and presenting diffuse muscular jerks. This episode had spontaneous resolution in a few minutes and the patient completely regained consciousness. No signs of sphincters relaxation or secondary trauma were evident. Her vital parameters never got altered during and immediately after the seizure and she had normal blood pressure and body temperature. The nurses reported appearance, a few hours before the seizure, of a brief, sudden episode of diminished awareness of environment and inability to respond to external stimuli; this was erroneously blamed to tiredness and lack of sleep.
Neither medical therapy at home nor voluntary drug abuse or toxin exposure were reported. She never had epileptic events or other neurological symptoms before. In her past clinical history no significant diseases could be found, except for a surgical intervention of saphenectomy in February 2008. She did not report familiar or personal history of psychiatric or neurological disorders, or, in particular, of epileptic disease.
She was working as an assistant for a disabled lady and had always done an efficient and competent job.
The patient got married when she was twenty-five years old and divorced ten years ago. She had one pregnancy; her daughter is twenty years old. She doesn't smoke and she drinks alcohol only occasionally. She is 165 cm high and she weights 63 kg.
Friends described her as a clever, polite, mild woman, able to speak a good Italian in a short time.
Taken to First Aid Unit and after medical evaluation, the patient was addressed to Brain CT in order to exclude haematomas or vascular injuries; she was then taken to Neurological Unit.
The patient was admitted in the Neurological Unit of Ferrara Hospital due to an acute, apparently generalized, convulsive seizure
Past medical history was not significant. A mild change in her emotional balance and behaviour control was reported in the past few months, when she felt more anxious than usual, with occasional compensative alcohol abuse.
Physical and neurological examinations and Brain Computed Tomography Scan (fig. Fig. ) on admission were unremarkable as well as the standard Electroencephalogram, which showed a bilateral, symmetrical 10 Hz Alfa rhythm with normal arrest reaction to eyes opening, and did not reveal any epileptic rhythms or figures.
The routine Electrocardiogram and laboratory tests (blood cells count and morphometry, plasmatic glucose level, seric electrolytes, coagulation, kidney and liver function indexes) didn't show any significant abnormalities, except for a mild red blood cells macrocitosis (MCV 97 fl). Blood pressure and temperature were normal.
The patient had no evident epileptic relapse during the subsequent clinical observation.
As the first line routine investigations did not reveal the cause of her epileptic episode, we planned to perform second level diagnostic tests, particularly sleep-deprivation sensitized electroencephalogram and cerebral MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), in order to unravel the epileptic focus or possible organic brain pathology.
Nevertheless, we could not complete our diagnostic program: the patient progressively developed an intense anxious state, explained away with the fear to lose her job because she was ill. For this reason she left the hospital two days after the admission, against physician's opinion.
A month later, the woman visited again the First Aid Unit, taken by her friends, upset by her sudden change in behaviour: she did not speak, even if she was able to understand and respond with gestures and signs; she was slow in all daily activities; she seemed uninterested and emotionless, lost in her world. Since her first visit to Hospital she didn't experienced any epileptic symptom.
After medical examinations, psychiatric and neurological consultations, the patient was hospitalized in a Psychiatric Unit for acute inpatient.
The psychiatric diagnostic possibilities were: a psychotic acute crisis, a major depression episode or hysteria.
During the first week of hospitalization, the major difficulty has been to establish a dialogue with her. She hardly communicated, she was very confused and she looked like she was experiencing visual hallucinations: her eyes were like following images in the space around her, and her hands were moving in front of her eyes, in a way similar as she had to get rid of webs. She couldn't speak Italian anymore, – although she was able to speak Italian before- but kept on understanding what we told her; she was still able to speak Russian, her mother language. Some symptoms could be reconnected to our diagnostic hypothesises, but, at the same time, others ruled out them [-]. During this period she took low doses, 3 mg/die, of Risperidone, an antipsychotic drug, without clinical improvement. During following days, the clinical development was very variable and characterized by fluctuations of the consciousness state, stereotypic movements, urinary incontinence and vomiting episodes. A significant episode occurred when we asked the patient to make her signature and she did it with syllable reduplications. This one and subsequent neuro-cognitive tests, such as the ""clock drawing test"" (fig. ), suggested a neurological diagnostic hypothesis.
We requested a new neurological consultation, where the patient showed any peripheral neurological signs, but several cognitive symptoms as apraxia, disturbance in executive functioning and partial amnesia, beside aphasia.
A second Electroencephalography examination showed a slow basic activity in both brain hemispheres and marked focal epileptic type anomalies in right frontal area, with a tendency to spread on the left homologous region.
Focusing on inflammatory or infective disease, we sent the patient, forty days after the first – negative – TC, to a new neuroradiological evaluation, and the specialist chose to undertake Brain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance: it evidenced a large lesion in the right frontal lobe, a smaller lesion in the left frontal lobe, a large irregular halo of altered signal on both sides, probably attributable to perilesional oedema.
Most likely, a contrast CT would have highlighted such big lesions in a similar way, but MRI was first undertaken, thinking it was an inflammatory or infective disease.
After Brain Magnetic Resonance, the patient was quickly transferred to the neurosurgery unit.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed two frontal focal lesions (4 × 3 cm on the left side and 5 × 4 cm on the right side) with peripheral contrast enhancement, surrounded by T1-ipointense and T2-hyperintense signal limited to frontal lobes (fig. Fig. ). Functional sequences detected increased microvascular permeability and cerebral blood volume, suggesting neoangiogenesis.
Her neurological examination was characterized by lethargy, apathy, mutacism, visual hallucinations, impairment of 6th right c.n. and papilloedema.
We administered antiedemigenic therapy with high doses of mannitol and dexamethasone.
In consideration of the neuroradiological findings, of inability to distinguish between primary and metastatic lesions and of the absence of other primary lesions on the thoracic-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, we performed surgical removal of the left frontal lesion. Our choice to approach the left lesion was related to its important mass effect and cortical localization. The removal was radical as confirmed by the post-operative CT scans(fig. Fig. )
After surgery, we assisted to rapid awakening and a gradual improvement of apathy and mutacism. Glioblastoma was histologically defined and then we performed the total removal of the contralateral lesion. Also in this case, histology reported the presence of a glioblastoma. A post-operative CT confirmed the radical tumors excision (fig. Fig. ).
Three weeks later the patient received limited field irradiation radiotherapy (40 Gray in 15 fractions over a period of 3 weeks) and temozolomide.
Two months later, the patient was able to perform her daily life activities with a mild disphoria (KPS – Karnovsky Performance Scale 100).","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [63.0, 'kg'], 'height': [165.0, 'cm']}",59.346,56.379,62.313,"The patient's gender is Female.

In November she visited a general practitioner complaining of right upper abdominal pain with no radiation. The pain, which was described as pressing in character, had been present for about three months and was intermittent. There was no nausea, vomiting, weight loss, melaena, change in bowel habit, urinary symptoms, or fever. The patient denied alcohol abuse and said that she was a nonsmoker and took no regular medication.
Blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, weight 75 kg, height 170 cm. Heart and lungs normal to percussion and auscultation. No lymph node enlargement. Abdomen slightly obese and soft. Tenderness present in the right upper abdomen. Bowel sounds normal. Renal angles clear. The clinical findings did not indicate a need for immediate hospital admission. On the basis of the history and the findings at the initial consultation, a series of laboratory tests and an ultrasound scan of the abdomen were ordered.
Relevant abnormal laboratory test results: C-reactive protein 108 mg/l (normal range < 5 mg/l), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 91 mm after two hours (normal range < 20 mm). The following values were within normal limits: blood count, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, bilirubin, serum electrolytes. Sonography showed an irregularly echogenic, partially calcified septate cystic structure in segment VIII of the liver (Fig. ). No other abnormalities were apparent. In view of the sonographic findings, the radiologist arranged for the immediate performance of a contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the abdomen. This showed a circumscribed rounded lesion measuring 5.8 × 4.7 × 5 cm in hepatic segment VIII (Fig. ). The lesion showed a thick rim of calcification and a suggestion of fine septa with no affinity for contrast medium. The liver was otherwise homogeneous and of normal appearance. The other parenchymal abdominal organs appeared normal and there were no enlarged lymph nodes.
Additional laboratory tests showed an antibody titre of 1:512 for E. granulosus and the presence of anti-E. multilocularis IgG. A western blot analysis was positive for Echinococcus granulosus and negative for Echinococcus multilocularis. After being informed about possible treatment options, the patient was referred to the university hospital. There she underwent hepatic segmental resection and cholecystectomy. Histological preparation of the material removed at operation showed caseating necrosis with a moderately severe, partly giant-cell, inflammatory reaction at the margin of an echinococcal cyst. There was no evidence of malignancy. The histological appearance was consistent with Echinococcus granulosus infection. Moderately severe chronic cholecystitis with moderate fibrosis of the gallbladder wall and cholecystolithiasis were also present. The skin sutures were removed on the tenth postoperative day. As a result of wound dehiscence, the wound healed partly by second intention. The patient was free of symptoms. Follow-up treatment with Eskazole® 400 mg (active ingredient: albendazole) b.i.d. was given. The patient's subsequent progress was without complication.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",61.437,58.365,64.509,"The patient's gender is Female.

Transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed diagnosis of severe mitral and tricuspid incompetence, dilated left ventricle, poor contractility (EF - 40%), pulmonary hypertension (PASP 90 mmHg).
On physical examination right lower abdomen mass was found and CT scan revealed large (12 cm × 11 cm × 7 cm) right kidney tumor with extension to infradiaphragmatic juxtahepatic part of inferior vena cava (caval thrombus 9 cm × 5 cm) (See Figures,,). 
Several options of treatment were considered but during discussion with cardiac surgeons and urologists one stage operation was decided and carefully planed.
In preoperative period patient received hypotensive drugs (furosemide 0,04 g, spironolactone 0,025 g), beta-blocker (metoprolol 0,05 g), antyarrhytmic drug (amiodarone 0,2 g), anticoagulant (enoxaparin 0,06 g), potassium and magnesium.
Cardiac part of operation was performed first. Chest was open through median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established by cannulation of both venae cavae and ascending aorta. After clumping the aorta heart was stopped by cold blood cardioplegia, and both valves were repaired - dilated mitral annulus with C-G Future Band (Medtronic Inc.USA) and tricuspid annulus with De Vega plasty. After aortic clump was removed heart rhytm was restored with DC shock. CPB was discontinued without problems, patient was decannulated, heparin reversed with protamine. Transoesophageal echocardiogram confirmed good result of valves repair. The extracorporeal circulation time was 72 minutes, the aorta was clumped for 49 minutes.
The second part of the operation was carried out just after the patient was hemodynamically stable. Urologists performed right radical nephrectomy through laparotomy. Accurate localization of the thrombus was assessed intraoperatively and a decision not to use cardiopulmonary bypass for thrombectomy was made. The kidney, the adrenal gland and the thrombus were removed intact (Figure ).
The operation took 4 hours 25 minutes. Blood loss was 600 ml. 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (5 × 220 ml), 2 units of red blood cells (2 × 500 ml) and 1 unit of platelets were administered. There were no complications. Macroscopic evaluation of the specimen showed 10 × 10 × 9 cm renal mass and 6 × 3 × 4 cm neoplasmatic thrombus. Microscopic examination revealed clear cell carcinoma of the kidney at the stage G1 pT3bN0M0, not infiltrating renal capsule (Figure). 10 lymphatic nodules were negative.
In postoperative echocardiography there were no signs of mitral either tricuspid incompetence or pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram demonstrated regular sinus rhythm. In peri- and postoperative period patient received antibiotic prophylaxis (ceftriaxone 2,0 g) , hypotensive drugs (furosemide 0,04 g, enalapril 0,05 g), beta-blocker (metoprolol 0,05 g), antyarrhytmic (amiodarone 0,2 g), anticoagulant (enoxaparin 0,06 g), acetylsalicylic acid (0,075 g), omeprazole (0,02 g), potassium and magnesium. 6 days after surgery oral anticoagulant therapy was started with acenocoumarol (0,002 g).

For initial 1-year, she was on twice-weekly hemodialysis, which was subsequently increased to thrice weekly. She presented to us with complaints of progressive painless abdominal distension of 8-month duration along with anorexia and weight loss. There was no history of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, pedal edema, fever, jaundice and no history to suggest hypothyroidism or connective tissue disease. There was no history of diabetes mellitus, jaundice, abdominal surgery and anti-tubercular treatment in past.

Judging from the blood testing results, she had hypercalcemia, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased to 1,253 U/L (normal range, 35 to 130); the patient was sent to the endocrinology department. Her past history was significant for a surgical procedure for fibrocystoma of her right humerus 20 years ago, and she had donated one of her kidneys to a relative 7 years previously. She had taken atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, and omega-3 fatty acid 1,000 mg daily for the past 3 years to treat high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The patient had been misdiagnosed with a thyroid nodule and hypothyroidism at another hospital 4 years previously and had immediately been prescribed levothyroxine 50 µg/day. At that time, the thyroid ultrasonography revealed two nodules that were 0.3 and 0.5 cm in diameter on her right lobe and another nodule that was 2.3×1.3 cm in size that was projected backwards. She had fine needle aspiration cytology for the nodule on the left lobe, and this had revealed a benign nodule. She had been followed up every 6 months by neck ultrasonography. Two years later, when the nodule on the left lobe of the thyroid had increased in size to 2.9×1.7 cm, they carried out radiofrequency ablation. However, the thyroid nodule remained the same size even after the radiofrequency ablation, so they monitored its size every 6 months for 2 more years (). During that time, the patient began experiencing backache and visited the orthopedics department of our hospital where she was suspected of having metabolic bone disease due to the high serum ALP value.

Serum chemistry values were also obtained: blood urea nitrogen, 26.9 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.98 mg/dL; glucose, 110 mg/dL; ALP, 1,011 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 11 U/L. Serum calcium was 14.6 mg/dL, phosphate was 3.5 mg/dL, and ionized calcium was 7.2 mg/dL. Serum protein and serum albumin were 6.9 and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. The results of the serum electrolyte test revealed that sodium was 135.7 mmol/L, potassium was 4.3 mmol/L, chloride was 104.0 mmol/L, and serum osmotic pressure was 286 mOsm/kg. According to the serum lipid examination, the total cholesterol was 146 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein was 33 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein was 79 mg/dL.

Under dual energy X-ray absorptiometry-based bone density examination, the T-score of the lumbar region was -1.4, while the T-scores of the neck were -1.2 on the left and -1.8 on the right. Except for the fifth lumbar vertebra, which had spondylolisthesis, nothing remarkable was found on magnetic resonance imaging.
According to further blood tests, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 9.6 ng/mL (normal range, 4.8 to 52.8), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was 10.5 pg/mL (normal range, 19.6 to 54.3), while the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was 1,911 pg/mL (normal range, 15 to 65). When we performed bone scanning with 99mTc, the amount of cortical bone radioactive isotope uptake increased very high (). Because we suspected hyperparathyroidism, we carried out a 99mTc sestamibi scan and suspected the lesion that had been previously diagnosed as a left thyroid nodule was likely a parathyroid adenoma (). Using thyroid Doppler ultrasonography, we discovered a hypervascular adenoma that was 5-cm-sized solid mass with similar echo of surrounding thyroid tissue in the center, and slightly low echo in outer part in the inferior site of left thyroid gland (), while on the right thyroid parenchyma we discovered two thyroid nodules, 0.3 and 0.5 cm each in diameter, that the patient had had 4 years before. We performed neck computed tomography and found there was no neck lymph node metastastasis and local invasion of other organs ().
The patient received both hydration and diuretic treatments until she underwent a surgical operation to control the hypercalcemia; she also had pamidronate 90 mg intravenous injections twice a week. On the 11th day after hydration and diuretic treatment, her condition had improved; serum calcium was reduced to 11.6 mg/dL, and creatinine improved to 1.11 mg/dL. On the 12th day, the patient had left parathyroid excision and was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma (). Following the surgical procedure, iPTH normalized to 42.5 pg/mL, but calcium and vitamin D were prescribed for 9 months to cure the hypocalcemia that had developed due to hungry bone syndrome. It has been a year since the surgical operation, and her calcium, phosphate, ALP, and iPTH all remain at normal levels.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [53, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.98, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Female'}",29.678,28.194,31.162,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 53 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.98 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.98/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**53 * 1.012 = 29.678.

3330,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-6719473-1,Extracted,"A 78-year-old patient presented with acute shortness of breath. She was too breathless to give a detailed history, though she did indicate on specific questioning that she had passed little urine in the previous week. Cardiac and respiratory examinations were normal. SpO2 was 98% on 8 l/min oxygen, with respiratory rate 20/min, heart rate 72/min and BP 160/70 mmHg. Her ECG () which was available before her blood chemistry showed tall T waves, loss of P wave, broad QRS complex together with high take-off >2 mm, coved ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in V1 (Brugada type 1 pattern). CXR showed clear lung fields.
Suspecting hyperkalaemia, initial emergency treatment was with calcium gluconate 10 ml 10% IV, repeated twice, which led to narrowing of the QRS complex. Blood chemistry subsequently showed serum potassium 9.5 mmol/l with blood urea 72 mmol/l, serum creatinine 2200 µmol/l and H+ 120 nmol/l indicating advanced kidney injury and that her dyspnoea was likely due to acidosis. There were no recent blood results for comparison.
Subsequent treatment with dextrose and insulin, nebulised salbutamol and emergency dialysis lowered her serum potassium to 4.3 mmol/l. Her ECG had by this time returned to normal (). Further investigations showed that the cause of her kidney injury was obstructive uropathy due to bilateral pelviureteric junction obstruction. We assumed this was a late presentation of an idiopathic pelviureteric junction obstruction as there was no evidence of stone or tumour on her scan. She received dialysis for six days, bilateral nephrostomies and then ureteric stents. When last seen at the clinic nine months after her initial presentation she was still feeling tired but otherwise well with serum potassium 3.9 mmol/l, blood urea 23.7 mmol/l and serum creatinine 545 µmol/l.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [78, 'years'], 'creatinine': [2200.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Female'}",1.468,1.395,1.541,"The patient is 78 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 2200.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Creatinine is 2200.0 µmol. To convert 2200.0 µmol of Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 2200.0 µmol Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.002 mol Creatinine. To convert from mol Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.226 g Creatinine. To convert 0.226 g of Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.226 g Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 226.0 mg Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 226.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 22.6 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 2200.0 µmol Creatinine/L converts to 22.6 mg Creatinine/dL. 
The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0.
The patient is female, so the gender coefficient is 0.742.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 22.6^(-1.154) * 78^(-0.203) * 1 * 0.742=1.468.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 1.468 mL/min/1.73m²."
6803,48,PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism,diagnosis,integer,pmc-8436833-1,Extracted,"A 27-year-old African American female patient with a history of stage IV endometriosis presented to the emergency department with exertional dyspnea of three-month duration. She also had an unintentional weight loss of approximately 25 pounds. The patient also endorsed night sweats, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea, but she denied chest pain or lower extremity swelling. Of notice, the patient had an endometrial cyst removal performed five years ago and an endometriosis-related paracentesis performed three years ago. The last follow-up with obstetrics/gynecology was 13 months ago.
On presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg, a temperature of 36.6°C, a heart rate range of 75-90 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right side of the chest.
Laboratory studies were significant for a hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dl (12-16 g/dl). Other complete blood count parameters and electrolytes were within normal limits. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed complete opacification of the right chest with a left tracheal deviation (Figure ). Computed tomography of pulmonary arteries (CT-PA) was negative for pulmonary emboli, but it showed a massive right pleural effusion with complete atelectasis of the right lung in addition to a left-sided cardiomediastinal shift (Figure ). Thoracocentesis with the removal of 2 to 3 l of serosanguinous fluid was performed, fluids turned to be exudative with few glandular and endometrial cells on cytohistological examination. Because the patient’s condition was not improving, a chest tube was placed. Continuous chest tube drainage with serosanguinous fluid was noted for eight days. Because the patient’s condition did not significantly improve, a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), a right diaphragm and pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis were performed, which revealed dense fibroconnective tissue with prominent chronic inflammation, including lymphoid aggregates and focal mesothelial hyperplasia (Figure ). No malignancy was reported in the histopathologic examination.
Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis in addition to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was done; these investigations showed endometrioma of about 7.2 × 7.1 × 4.2 cm in the mid-upper pelvis with a moderate amount of hemorrhagic fluid in the pelvis and bilateral paracolic gutters (Figure ), and the latter finding was similar to a prior finding on a CT scan of the abdomen that was done three years ago. Because these fluids did not cause any symptoms to the patient, the obstetrics/gynecology team’s decision was not to drain, believing that the endometriosis treatment itself should improve this condition.
Transvaginal ultrasonography and complete pelvic duplex ultrasonography of the lower abdomen showed a large septate cystic lesion in the left adnexa, which has been present for three years. The lesion was consistent with endometrioma (Figure ). The patient was discharged on Leuprolide Depot 11.25 mg injections every three months and norethindrone hormonal therapy of 5 mg tablets daily to prevent menopausal symptoms, with a close outpatient follow-up.",What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?,"{'O₂ saturation percentage': [97.0, '%'], 'Hemoptysis': False, 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Unilateral Leg Swelling': False, 'Recent surgery or trauma': False, 'Hormone use': True, 'age': [27, 'years'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [7590.0, 'beats per minute']}",2,2,2,"The current count of PERC criteria met is 0.

2520,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-5075151-1,Extracted,"A 57-year-old man was referred to our hospital for severe lumbago. His symptoms appeared approximately 3 months prior to referral. After experiencing such symptoms for about a month, the patient consulted an orthopedist. A lumbar spinal radiography showed no significant findings. Despite treatment for pain relief, his lumbago persisted. At presentation, the patient reported no particular past medical history or known allergies. His medication included oxycodone hydrochloride hydrate, loxoprofen sodium hydrate, rebamipide, prochlorperazine maleate, and magnesium oxide. He did not smoke or consume alcohol, and worked as a designer. His mother had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and his sister had colon cancer. On physical examination, the patient weight 82 kg and was 174 cm tall. His blood pressure was 189/128 mmHg; his pulse was 92 beats per minute; body temperature was 36.9 °C; respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation level was 98 % while breathing ambient air. No swelling of the lymph nodes was palpable. His physical examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 11,100/mm3, platelet count of 73,000/mm3, international normalized ratio for prothrombin time of 1.15, fibrinogen level of 102 mg/dL, fibrin degradation products of 65.7 μg/mL, d-dimer level of 18.1 μg/mL, antithrombin-III activity of 61 %, C reactive protein level of 3.63 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.32 mg/dL, calcium level of 11.3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase level of 164 U/L, alanine aminotransferase level of 119 U/L, alkaline phosphatase level of 547 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase level of 552 U/L. Other test results are shown in Table . These laboratory data suggested that the patient had DIC.
Abdominal ultrasonography showed mild splenomegaly. Non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT), gastrointestinal endoscopy, and colonoscopy detected no abnormal findings. Non-contrast abdominal CT revealed multiple bone masses (Fig. ); however, no tumors were found in the liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, bladder, prostate, or pancreas. Therefore, a bone marrow biopsy was performed at the left iliac, revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical studies of the biopsy specimen showed positivity for keratin 7, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9; negativity for prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and napsin A, while inconclusive for keratin 20 and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT disclosed diffuse abnormal uptake in the bones and tail of the pancreas (Fig. ), and contrast enhanced whole-body CT depicted a tumor of approximately 28 mm in diameter with poor enhancement in the pancreatic tail (Fig. ). The patient’s final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer located in the tail of the pancreas with diffuse bone metastases and DIC. His DCBM was thus believed to originate from the pancreatic cancer.
We administered nafamostat mesilate to treat DIC and opioid analgesics to relieve the patient’s lumbago and sharp osteocopic pain. However, we were unable to administer systemic chemotherapy owing to his poor condition. The patient’s general status rapidly deteriorate, and he was transferred to a palliative care unit (PCU). Laboratory data at discharge are shown in Table . He died at the PCU approximately 2 months after admission to our hospital.
A pathological condition derived from carcinoma and diffuse bone metastases with DIC was first reported by Jarcho in 1936 []. Hayashi et al. later defined such a pathological condition with DIC or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia as DCBM []. Almost all the previously published reports have shown that DCBM results from gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer []. To the best of our knowledge, only one prior report has described pancreatic cancer as the origin of DCBM []. In the present case, contrast whole-body CT revealed a tumor with poor enhancement in the tail of the pancreas and multiple bone masses. No other abnormal structures were identified by CT, gastrointestinal endoscopy, or colonoscopy, whereas PET-CT demonstrated diffuse abnormal skeletal uptake. Laboratory data in the above-mentioned case showed marked elevation of Span-1 and DUPAN-2 and DIC, while the left iliac bone marrow biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma cells. Such findings were probably indicative of pancreatic cancer with DCBM. The condition of our patient was very severe at admission, although his tumor size was significantly smaller than that in the previously reported case (28 mm vs. 55 mm) [], and he died within 2 months of diagnosis. A young age and poorly differentiated carcinoma have been suggested to be associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer cases with DCBM [, ]. Our patient was diagnosed at 57 years of age and had poorly differentiated carcinoma, which might explain his extremely poor prognosis despite a small pancreatic tumor size.
A previous report indicates that the tumor detection rate with non-contrast CT was 23 % when tumor size was less than 20 mm, 59 % for tumors measuring less than 40 mm, and 100 % in cases of tumors measuring more than 40 mm []. In the present case, the tumor size was 28 mm, and it was undetectable via non-contrast CT. It was subsequently found by PET and contrast-enhanced CT imaging.
While the serum CA19-9 levels were normal in cases of gastric cancer with DCBM [–], the serum CA19-9 levels were markedly elevated in cases of pancreatic cancer with DCBM in the present study as well as those in a previous study []. Although the mechanism for this finding is unknown, the extremely high CA 19-9 levels might be helpful in the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with DCBM before the histopathological examination results are obtained.
Exacerbation of DCBM occurs rapidly, and the mean survival time is 4.6 months after the onset of DCBM []. A proper diagnosis and timely administration of chemotherapy and treatment of DIC are crucial to prolong survival []. Pancreatic tumors are occasionally challenging to detect with non-contrast CT. Therefore, it is important to consider the pancreas as a possible origin of DCBM and perform contrast-enhanced CT when multiple bone metastases are observed.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Both the wounds were badly contaminated and the amputated limb was bleeding. He was on Tab. Amlodipine 5 mg once daily for hypertension and, Glipizide 5 mg once daily and Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type-2 diabetes mellitus since 2 years. He was also a known case of HOCM and had undergone alcohol ablation of the interventricular septum one year ago.
He was conscious and oriented. His pulse rate was 120/m and the blood pressure (BP) in his left lower limb was 210/120 mmHg (mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 150 mmHg). A systolic murmur was heard over the left parasternal area. The respiratory system examination was normal. The mouth opening was one-and-a-half fingers breadth, he had Mallampati airway class-3 and the upper two incisors were loose and broken. Neck extension was restricted and the thyromental distance was three fingers breadth.
His haemoglobin was 11 g/dl, blood sugar was 173 mg/dl, blood urea was 26 mg/dl, serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl and serum electrolytes were normal. An electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle branch block with left ventricular hypertrophy []. Echocardiography showed a thickened interventricular septum, systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet, left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 60 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, good right ventricular function and no mitral regurgitation. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with no signs of congestive cardiac failure. The cervical spine X-ray revealed spondylotic changes at C5-C7.
An intravenous access was secured on the left foot. The right dorsalis pedis artery was cannulated and continuous BP monitoring was initiated. Intravenous fentanyl 150 μg and labetalol 10 mg, followed by an infusion of 2 mg/min, were administered. After 20 min, his heart rate decreased to 106/min and BP to 196/114 mmHg (MAP 140 mmHg). He was scheduled for emergency hemostasis and debridement of the amputated limb and contused lacerated wound. The patient was nil-by-mouth for 2 h.
In the operation theater, after applying the standard monitors, the right subclavian vein was cannulated and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring was initiated. The initial CVP was 4 mmHg. The BP had decreased to 180/110 mmHg (MAP = 133 mmHg) and pulse rate to 90-100/min. It was decided to achieve the hemostasis and debride the amputated limb first, and follow it up with debridement of the CLW.
Right brachial plexus block was performed via a supraclavicular approach using a 23 G needle. After eliciting paraesthesia, a mixture of 6 ml 2% lignocaine and 18 ml 0.5% bupivacaine was injected slowly with frequent aspirations. He was sedated with intravenous midazolam 2 mg following initiation of the block. The debridement and revision amputation were completed in 120 min. Following this, left axillary block was performed with a mixture of 8 ml 2% lignocaine and 30 ml 0.25% bupivacaine using a multiple injections technique. Both the blocks worked adequately. Intraoperatively, the pulse rate and MAP were maintained at 80-90/min and 110-120 mmHg, respectively. The total blood loss was 500-550 ml. The blood sugar was monitored hourly, and it was maintained between 100 and 200 mg/dl with insulin infusion. The surgeries were uneventful and the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. Analgesia lasted for 6 h post-operatively, which was managed further with fentanyl infusion.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [50, 'years'], 'weight': [80.0, 'kg'], 'height': [1.58, 'm'], 'creatinine': [1.3, 'mg/dL']}",62.541,59.414,65.668,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 50 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 1.58 m. The patient's weight is 80.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 80.0 kg / (1.58 m * 1.58 m) = 32.046 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 32.0, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 1.58 m, which is 1.58 m * 39.3701 in/m = 62.205 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.205 (in inches) - 60) = 55.071 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 55.071 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 55.071 kg + 0.4 * (80.0 kg  - 55.071 kg) = 65.043 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 65.043 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 50) * 65.043 * 1) / (1.3 * 72) = 62.541 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 62.541 mL/min."

Although he had a multiyear history of hypertension, sufficient BP control was not achieved until admission. His serum creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dL 10 months before admission.
Laboratory tests showed serum creatinine of 7.56 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase of 1366 U/L, and hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL. Peripheral blood smear showed schistocytes. An abnormal signal in the cerebrum in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and Keith-Wagener stage IV retinopathy were also noted. Kidney biopsy revealed severe narrowing or occlusion of small arteries with severe endothelial damage as well as shrunken glomeruli and interstitial cell infiltration (Figure ). Compared with normotensive normal kidney tissue that showed isometric nuclei of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) forming an orderly line (Figure ), varying sized EC nuclei were prominent, and there were fewer nuclei within the arterioles in the patient (Figure ), indicating severe vascular EC damage due to severely elevated blood pressure. Based on the above findings, we diagnosed this patient's AKI as acute with chronic ischemic renal damage due to refractory hypertension with microangiopathic hemolysis. He was intensively treated by intermittent hemodialysis, and his heart failure and accompanying pulmonary congestion gradually improved.
Although BP control by nicaldipine and olmesartan allowed hemodialysis withdrawal after six treatment sessions, the serum creatinine level remained high. After written informed patient consent, we performed autologous CD34-positive cell transplantation for AKI.

In this trial, three doses (into one renal artery) were set: low dose (5 × 105/kg body weight), middle dose (1 × 106/kg body weight), and high dose (2 × 106/kg body weight) for three patients in each group. After safety was confirmed, the dose of CD34-positive cells was increased to the next higher dose. The low starting dose (5 × 105/kg body weight, ie, 1 × 106/kg body weight, bilateral renal arteries) was based on a consideration of safety in previous reports that used CD34-positive cells for other diseases, including critical limb ischemia and liver cirrhosis. This dose-escalating protocol was approved by the special committee for class 2 regenerative medicine certified by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan (SKRM-2-003). After 800 μg/d (400 μg/m2 body surface area) of G-CSF treatment for 5 consecutive days, leukapheresis (COMTEC, Fresenius Kabi Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) was performed to harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cells on day 5. Magnetic separation of CD34-positive cells using a CliniMACS instrument was performed on day 6 using anti-CD34 antibody-labeled magnetic nanobeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Immediately after CD34-positive cells were separated and the viability (98.1%) and purity (95.6%) of collected cells were confirmed, 90 million CD34-positive cells were dissolved in 100 mL saline. A guiding catheter was placed in either renal artery through right femoral artery by an interventional radiologist. Cells were directly administered into each renal artery (45 million CD34-positive cells in 50 mL saline) at a rate of 150 mL/h (90 million CD34-positive cells in total) using a syringe driver.
The patient's general condition was unremarkable except for a transient elevation in body temperature to 38.1°C 5 days after transplantation. Platelet count and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 transiently increased during the early post-treatment course (Table ). The patient was discharged to home 10 days after cell transplantation.
Twenty-three weeks after cell therapy, his serum creatinine level was 2.96 mg/dL. Blood pressure was well controlled with 60 mg of nifedipine and 20 mg of olmesartan.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [224.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [116.0, 'mm hg']}",152.0,144.4,159.6,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 152.0 mm Hg."
8713,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8006414-1,Extracted,"A 44-year-old male was admitted to the ICU because of impaired consciousness, with a Glasgow Coma Score of 11 (GCS: E4, M5, V2), after reported ingestion of diazepam. The intoxication occurred at the pharmacy during the evening hours. The patient was found unconsciousness by an employee, next to an emptied pharmaceutical powder canister that had contained diazepam.
Attempted suicide was suspected because of a letter left by the patient. Circumstances thus indicated that the patient had ingested 2,000 mg (20 g; 250 mg/kg) of diazepam, some 2–4 h prior to presentation at the ICU. The patient has no relevant medical, family, or psychosocial history, as well as no past interventions. No medical report about depressive disorder or previous suicide attempts exists. The patient worked as an economist in the pharmacy. On ICU admission, the patient's blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 90/min, with regular rhythm. The SpO2 was 90%, and the patient was hypothermic (35.5°C). The patient's weight was 80 kg, height 175 cm, and BMI 26.12 kg/m2. The patient had no renal or liver dysfunction. Plasma analyses revealed no changes in urea (3.27 mmol/L), creatinine (52.9 μmol/L), bilirubin (6.39 μmol/L), AST (0.37 ucat/l), ALT (0.21 ucat/l), and AMS (1.38 ucat/l). Further physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood and urine samples were taken for toxicology investigation. According to protocol, the patient was administered 75 g of activated charcoal and 20 g of MgSO4 by nasogastric tube every 6 h. I.v. flumazenil (0.5 mg) administration was without effect. Because of agitation, intermittent i.v. administration of propofol (50 mg) was used. BDZ intoxication was confirmed from blood and urine samples 5 h after admission, with plasma concentration above the upper detection limit of 2,000 μg/l. Plasma and urine BDZs were measured using DRI® Benzodiazepine Serum Tox Assay and Emit® II Plus Benzodiazepine Assay for urine. Because of hypoventilation and irregular breathing, decreased SpO2 (to 88%) and impaired GCS (to 3), the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated starting from 5 h after admission without the need for additional sedation. Subsequent repetitive administration of flumazenil (0.5 mg i.v.; three times) was without effect.
During the subsequent days, the patient remained unconsciousness with an absence of spontaneous breathing. Plasma BDZ remained above the upper detection limit, which prompted the start of MARS on the fourth day of admission and its continuation for 5 days, one session per day. Informed consent was obtained from the patient's relatives.
Throughout the course of MARS, plasma levels of BDZ were measured twice daily—at 6:00 (before the MARS session) and at around 14:00 (after the MARS session). The first MARS session lowered the plasma level of BDZ from 1,772 to 780 μg/L, and subsequent sessions further lowered the BDZ levels (, ). By day eight, the plasma level of BDZ had dropped to 191.2 μg/L. The patient regained consciousness and was weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated. Two days later, the patient was discharged to the department of internal medicine and subsequently to the department of psychiatry.
As a result of MARS, plasma BDZ levels were effectively lowered by a similar percentage at each session, averaging 45% (, ). In contrast, changes in the plasma BDZ level following each MARS session showed a different pattern, with a substantial and increasing percentage of nightly rebound following the initial three MARS sessions, followed by an abrupt halting of the increase, and even a net removal of BDZ following the last MARS session (). Of note, when expressed as ug/L change, the nightly rebound following the first three MARS sessions was similar.
Plasma BDZ levels during the last measurements, when MARS had been stopped, allowed calculation of the elimination half-life (t1/2; assuming a volume of distribution 1.5 L/kg and a body weight of 80 kg). During the first time interval, the BDZ level dropped from 191 to 161 μg/l in 17 h; consequently the calculated elimination t1/2 was 69 h. During the last 24 h of measurements, the BDZ level dropped from 161 to 111 μg/l; therefore, calculated t1/2 was 45 h. Overall, calculation of the elimination half-life over the last three time points, when the plasma BDZ level dropped from 191 to 111 μg/l in 41 hours, rendered a similar result, with a t1/2 of 52 h.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [80.0, 'kg'], 'height': [175.0, 'cm']}",74.279,70.565,77.993,"The patient's gender is Male.

He also had a history of the inability to father a child and have never sought medical treatment for the same. There was no history of loss of libido, hypothyroidism, radiation to head or neck, surgery to head or abdomen, or symptoms of raised intracranial tension. On examination, his height was 156 cm and weight was 45 kg. His vitals were stable. He had pallor and digital clubbing. External genital examination showed genital ambiguity in the form of bifid scrotum, which was rugose and pigmented with a phallus of length 9 cm with well-formed glands []. The right gonads were not palpable in labioscrotal fold or elsewhere and the left gonads were palpable in the left inguinal region. There was no vaginal opening. Sexual maturity rate (SMR) P2 B1 with no axillary hair. He had poor facial and body hair. A natal history was later reviewed with him and there was no history of salt-wasting crisis, maternal virilization, or history of sex reversal.

Laboratory investigations included hemoglobin of 8 g/dl, total leukocyte count of 8000/mm3, platelet count of 4.5 lakhs, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 60. Liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), blood glucose, serum electrolytes, cortisol (8 am cortisol 16.08 mcg/dl), and 17-OH-progesterone were normal (1.1 ng/ml). Pooled follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were 14 mIU/mL and 9 mIU/mL, respectively; thyroid-stimulating hormone: 3.8 mIU/L, T4: 130 nmol/L (60–140), basal total testosterone: 240 ng/dL, estradiol 20 pg/ml (normal male: 10–50 pg/ml), prolactin 12 ng/ml (5–20 ng/ml), and inhibin B 156 ng/ml (80–300 ng/ml). Work up for tuberculosis (TB) which includes sputum acid fast bacilli and TB polymerase chain reaction study with sputum and blood specimens were negative. Chest-X ray was normal.
High-resolution computed tomography chest showed irregular solid lesions in the right upper lobe suggestive of a lung metastasis. Search for primary malignancy was done and investigations included upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, USG abdomen and pelvis, and tumor markers study (alpha fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, carcinoembryonic antigen, and prostate-specific antigen levels). Ultrasound of the pelvis showed hypoplastic uterus with no gonads visualized. Tumor markers and gastrointestinal study were normal. Karyotyping (30 cells and 100 cells) revealed 45, X genotype. In view of the possibility of malignancy arising from a dysgenetic gonad and the inability to localize primary malignancy from the initial evaluation, we proceeded with a laparoscopy. Laparoscopic examination was done and visualized the right gonads and ducts. Laparoscopy showed enlarged right gonads in the ovarian fossa with bilateral fallopian tubes and hypoplastic uterus []. The right gonad was adhering to the adjacent peritoneum. The left gonad was visualized in the left inguinal region and biopsy was taken to confirm the type of gonad. The right gonad with fallopian tubes and rudimentary uterus was removed. A thorough histopathological examination of the right gonad showed dysgerminoma, and the left gonad showed testicular tissue (seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells). Dysgerminoma arising from the right gonad showed sheets or nests of large, uniform polygonal cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm with distinct squared off cell membranes and with loose stroma []. No ovarian tissue was noted in these sections. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the identification of Y chromosome was done in gonadal tissue.

She had a past medical history of Cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and myocardial infarction (MI). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed first-degree heart block, prolonged QT interval with anterolateral infarct. Echocardiograph (ECHO) showed an ejection fraction of 45–50%, left atrial enlargement, mild pulmonary hypertension, and trace mitral regurgitation.
Preoperative airway assessment revealed a Mallampati score of IV, three finger breadth mouth opening, slight limitation of neck movement, and loose carious teeth. With this assessment, the patient was predicted to be difficult to intubate. The anesthetic plan included management of the predicted difficult intubation with the GlideScope® with other usual backup planes for difficult intubation.
Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 150 µg, lidocaine 100 mg, propofol 150 mg and succinylcholine 100 mg.
The GlideScope® blade tip was placed in the vallecula and the vocal cords and epiglottis were seen. A size 7 endotracheal tube (ETT) was mounted in the GlideRite® rigid stylet and then passed into the oral cavity for intubation. The endotracheal tube (ETT appeared to slide into the oropharynx with relative ease and the endotracheal tube was placed into the trachea. The stylet was removed, and positive EtCO2 and equal bilateral breath sounds was confirmed. A successful GlideScope® intubation was assumed.
As the surgeon began the procedure, he noticed that ETT had pierced and entered the tissue of the retromolar trigonum (the same space which holds the lingual nerve), and then proceeded to pass through the oropharyngeal space and re-enter the vocal cords [Figure and ].
We decided to remove ETT rather than cutting the tissues to free it, to avoid trauma to lingual nerve. We re-inserted another size 7 ETT with the aid of the GlideScope® camera. Positive EtCO2 and equal bilateral breath sounds was confirmed. Surgery was completed uneventfully; however, the surgeon stated multiple times that the patient's oral mucosa was very fragile and easily torn. The patient was easily extubated and transported to post anesthesia care unit (PACU). Both intubations were performed by the student registered nurse anesthetist (SRNA).
PACU staff was instructed to look for signs of lingual nerve injury (numbness in the tongue, loss of ability to taste, tingling sensation in the tongue, pain, burning, or electric shock sensations in the tongue, speech impairment and drooling).
The PACU stay was uneventful, the patient denied any of the above mentioned symptoms, and was discharged.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [102.1, 'kg']}",142.1,134.995,149.205,"The patient's weight is 102.1 kg.

8589,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-3995150-1,Extracted,"The patient was a 75-year-old man. He had undergone surgery for a left inguinal hernia 23 years earlier, but the details were unknown.
Four years earlier, the left inguinal hernia recurred and underwent repeated prolapse, spontaneous rectification, and self-reduction. Since last year, the hernia occasionally became incarcerated. On each occasion, the patient was treated by manual reduction as an outpatient, but he did not wish to undergo surgery, and the situation continued as it was. Over the previous month, the hernia frequently became incarcerated, and the patient visited our hospital as usual for manual reduction of the incarceration. This time the patient agreed to surgery and was admitted and treated surgically on the same day. Physical findings were as follows: height 170 cm, weight 70 kg, and temperature 36.6°C. The left lower abdomen was slightly tender, but there were no symptoms of peritoneal irritation such as rebound tenderness or guarding. After hernial reduction, neither inguinal region had any palpable swelling, and chest findings were normal.
Blood test findings were WBC 8600/μL, Hb 10.4 g/dL, and CRP 0.19 mg/dL, indicating mild anemia and no inflammatory response. Abdominal X-ray on admission showed a dilated small bowel and niveau formation, indicating bowel obstruction. Pelvic CT revealed that the hernia had prolapsed into the left scrotum and the small bowel was dilated. There was no ascites.
The first operation used the anterior approach. When the tissue that adhered around the spermatic cord was peeled back, a direct hernia was seen protruding from directly above the pubic bone into the scrotum (). The sac was partially released and investigated as far as possible into the abdominal cavity, but the operation was completed by radical surgery using a Mesh Plug (DAVOL Inc., Warwick, RI) without it being possible to confirm necrosis of the small bowel.
Although the patient's postoperative clinical course included bowel movements and expulsion of flatus, abdominal CT was done because of fluid drainage from the nasogastric tube and persistence of gas in the small bowel on X-ray. The small bowel was less dilated than at admission, but a portion of it appeared to be tumor-like inside the pelvic cavity (). This was thought to be the result of repeated hernial incarcerations over many years that had led the small bowel to adhere globosely. An ileus tube was inserted on the 8th day of admission. Subsequent drainage was <300 mL/day, and there were bowel movements and expulsion of flatus. The ileus tube was removed on the 13th day of admission because ileus tube imaging showed transfer of contrast agent to the colon after 1 hour (). From the 14th day of admission, the patient resumed eating and was able to consume an entire meal, and his clinical course was problem-free, but when the diet was increased to 7 : 1 rice gruel on the 20th day of admission, he developed sudden abdominal pain, fever, and symptoms of peritoneal irritation over the whole abdomen. Abdominal CT detected free air, and emergency abdominal surgery was performed (2nd operation) based on a diagnosis of peritonitis due to gastrointestinal perforation.
The lower abdomen was opened by midline incision, revealing the abdominal cavity to be contaminated with intestinal fluids. Tracing the dilated small bowel, thickened peritoneum in the vicinity of the left internal inguinal ring was found to be protruding into the abdominal cavity, and the small bowel was pinched at the same site and perforated on the dilated oral side directly before entering the hernial sac (Figures and ). It was thought that reduction en masse of the incarcerated hernia had taken place during reduction, causing perforation of the small bowel. There was no necrosis of the incarcerated small bowel. The perforated portion of the small bowel was resected, and the internal inguinal ring was closed by suture from the abdominal cavity. There were no notable postoperative complications, and on the 6th day of admission after the 2nd operation, the patient resumed eating and was discharged.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [70.0, 'kg'], 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",67.562,64.184,70.94,"The patient's gender is Male.

8661,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8381499-1,Extracted,"In August 2020, a 13-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital due to prolonged and intermittent fever. She first developed a fever 10 months previously that lasted for 7 days. During that time, her body temperature was elevated twice per day, reached as high as 40 °C, and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and chills, but no rash. Subsequently, she had a fever almost once per month, lasting for about 5 to 7 days and resolving after antipyretic treatment.
Previous examinations at the local hospital (December 2019) determined her white blood cell (WBC) count was 10.18 × 109/L (75.1% neutrophils), eosinophil count was normal (0.13 × 109/L, reference range: 0.04 ~ 0.49 × 109/L), hemoglobin was 123 g/L, platelet count was 213 × 109/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 13.22 mg/L (reference range: 0 ~ 8 mg/L). Then in March 2020, a routine blood test indicated a WBC count of 7.01 × 109/L (63.6% neutrophils), hemoglobin of 107 g/L, platelet count of 227 × 109/L, and CRP of 79.6 mg/L. There were no microbiological tests.
She came to our hospital at that time because her fever was frequent and the duration was prolonged. She also had a history of right upper limb fractures after two falls when she was 6 and 10 years old. There were no abnormalities in her personal or family history and no abnormal signs on admission (bodyweight: 66 kg, stable from disease onset; blood pressure: 126/81 mmHg; height: 170 cm). The blood pressure in her extremities was symmetrical, and she had no abnormal vascular murmur.
Laboratory results in August 2020 (Tables and ) indicated that the WBC count and neutrophils were in the normal ranges, and the hemoglobin was slightly low. Indicators of infection and inflammation, including procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were obviously increased. We also measured the levels of multiple cytokines. The level of interleukin (IL) -6 was significantly elevated, the level of IL-10 was slightly elevated, but the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, INF-γ, and TNF were normal. Tests for mycoplasma and herpes simplex virus-IgM antibodies were positive. Screening for tumor markers, such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), indicated no abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration results were negative. Pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) and whole abdominal enhanced CT results indicated no apparent abnormalities, while echocardiography and subclavian artery ultrasound were also normal. We administered anti-infective therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin after hospitalization. After 3 days, her body temperature returned to normal, and her CRP level decreased to 40.4 mg/L.
At 2 days after admission, her serum creatinine was slightly increased at 87.9 μmol/L (reference range: 33 ~ 75 μmol/L), and 99mTc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging indicated the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 74.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (reduced renal function). Urinalysis indicated hematuria and proteinuria, and analysis of urinary sediment indicated 2 erythrocyte casts per HPF and 34.7 RBCs per HPF, with a dysmorphic rate of 60%. She tested positive for ANA (1:1000), but negative for anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-GBM, ANCA (PR3-ANCA, cANCA, MPO-ANCA, pANCA), and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies (PLA2R). The complement C3 and C4 levels were in the normal range, although the serum IgE was increased. Kidney ultrasound showed that both kidneys were enlarged with increased renal cortex echoes and blurred cortical and medullary boundaries.
Therefore we performed a kidney biopsy and examined 25 glomeruli using microscopy (Fig. ). Seven glomeruli had global sclerosis, 1 had cellular crescents, 11 had fibro cellular crescents, and 4 had fibrous crescents. The remaining glomerular aberrations were mild, with open capillary loops and no significant alterations in the mesangial area. However, the visceral and parietal epithelial cells were swollen, and Bowman’s capsule thickened and stratified. The renal tubular epithelial cells had granular degeneration, multifocal tubular atrophy (45%), the absence of tubular structures with interstitial fibrosis, and infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes. There were no apparent changes in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated 6 glomeruli had granular deposition of IgG (+) in the mesangial area and capillary wall, but the other results were negative (IgA−, IgM−, C1q−, Fib−, and C3±). Electron microscopy indicated one glomerulus had a slightly increased segmental glomerular mesangial matrix, a small number of electron-dense regions scattered in the mesangial area, swollen podocytes and parietal epithelial cells, and a collapsed capillary basement membrane. The thickness of the GBM was normal, and there was no evidence of delamination, tearing, or arachnoid changes. There were also no thickened inner lighter layers of the GBM. The mitochondria of the renal tubular epithelial cells were swollen, and the endoplasmic reticulum was expanded. The basement membranes of some tubules were thickened, and collagen fibers and a small number of monocytes and lymphocytes were present in the interstitium. There were no apparent changes in the arterioles.
Our results indicated the patient had ANCA-negative PICGN. We administered 2 courses of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500 mg/day for 3 days each), and then oral prednisone (60 mg/day) with gradual tapering. We simultaneously administered intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg/day for 2 days each month) and oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 0.75 in the morning, 0.5 in the evening). At the 3-month follow-up (November 2020), the child’s 24-h urine protein level decreased but remained slightly elevated at 0.59 g/day (previously 1.90 g/day), her serum creatinine decreased to the normal range (42.6 μmol/L; previously 87.9 μmol/L), and her serum albumin increased to the normal range (40.2 g/L; previously 32.6 g/L).","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [66.0, 'kg'], 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",63.262,60.099,66.425,"The patient's gender is Female.

However, the patient did not improve over the next 3 months and complained of persistent dizziness and nausea.
He was then referred to our hospital for further investigation. On questioning, he denied weight loss or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. His height and weight were 180.9 cm and 145.8 kg, and he had a body mass index of 44.5 kg/m2. Physical examination did not reveal any abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, or palpable masses. His complete blood count was white blood cells 9,770/μL, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, hematocrit 31.6% (mean corpuscular volume 71.8 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 22 pg), and platelets 281,000/μL. Serum total bilirubin was 1.2 mg/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase was 37 IU/L, and serum alanine transaminase was 67 IU/L. Abdominal computed tomography showed a large polypoid mass in the duodenum (). It was a hypodense tubular intraluminal mass measuring about 9.3×2 cm in the first and second parts of the duodenum. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a large pedunculated and eroded mass with a thick stalk arising from the duodenal bulb. The tumor was located on the anterior surface of the duodenal bulb and had a wide base, causing near-total obstruction (-). The tip of the tumor also was covered with exposed vessels and hematin, but was not actively bleeding (). Endoscopic polypectomy was performed. However, the lesion was too large to fit into the conventional snare. We grasped a portion of the mass and pulled it up into the stomach with the snare, and then performed two partial snare polypectomies (). Next, we performed endoscopic submucosal dissection on the bulb of the duodenum after the duodenal U-turn (, ). Hemoclips were applied to prevent bleeding and perforation. The gross endoscopic resection specimen showed a large duodenal lesion measuring 9.3×2 cm (). Histology confirmed a Brunner’s gland hamartoma (, ).
The patient did not experience any serious complications from this procedure. He was started on proton pump inhibitor therapy and discharged after 7 days. His dizziness and melena resolved after the endoscopic procedure, and his anemia resolved after 1 month. At 4 months after discharge, his complete blood count had normalized. At 6 months, a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not find any evidence of recurrence or tumor remnants ().",What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?,"{'age': [30, 'years'], 'Alanine aminotransferase': [67.0, 'U/L'], 'Aspartate aminotransferase': [37.0, 'U/L'], 'Platelet count': [281000.0, 'µL']}",0.483,0.459,0.507,"The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.
The patient's concentration of AST is 37.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of ALT is 67.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of platelets is 281000.0 count/µL. To convert 281000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 281000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 281000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 281000000000.0/(10^9) = 281.0 billion platelet counts per liter.
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (30 * 37.0)/(281.0 * sqrt(67.0)) = 0.483.
Hence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 0.483."

She was suspected to have craniopharyngioma on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and underwent surgical resection with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. At the age of 11 years and 2 months, she weighed 60 kg (2.15 standard deviation score [SDS]) and was 152 cm (1.03 SDS) tall with a body mass index (BMI) of 26 kg/m2 (>97th percentile) and Tanner stage I. After resection, she was treated using a cyber gamma-knife (3 cycle) due to the presence of residual tumor. She developed multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, which were treated with hormone replacement therapy including levothyroxine 100 μg daily, hydrocortisone 6 mg/m2/day, oral desmopressin 0.1 mg 3 times per day, and conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg daily. During her regular hospital follow-up, laboratory findings demonstrated an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 144 IU/L, an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 65 IU/L, a total cholesterol level of 281 mg/dL, and a triglyceride level of 425 mg/dL, with increased echogenicity on her liver ultrasound, indicating NAFLD.
After 2 years of tumor resection, increased size of residual tumor was found, suggesting recurred craniopharyngioma. She was referred to our hospital. At the age of 13 years and 3 months, her height, weight, and BMI were 155.5 cm (-0.08 SDS), 65.7 kg (1.81 SDS), and 27 kg/m2 (97th percentile), respectively. Her sexual maturity rating was Tanner stage I. Laboratory findings showed an AST of 103 IU/L, an ALT of 104 IU/L, a total cholesterol of 230 mg/dL, a triglyceride level of 359 mg/dL, total protein of 7.0 g/dL, serum albumin level of 4.3 g/dL, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, and chloride of 106 mmol/L. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 binding protein were 67.2 ng/mL and 3,596 ng/mL, respectively. She underwent a second tumor resection at our hospital. Two months later, she was diagnosed with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency on a combined anterior pituitary function test () with Tanner stage I, and was kept on hormone replacement therapy. Three years after the second resection, her fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were 126 mg/dL and 6.7%, respectively. She was diagnosed with type 2 DM associated with hypothalamic obesity, and was started on metformin. During the follow-up period, the NAFLD, dyslipidemia, and type 2 DM laboratory findings improved.
She was lost to follow up for 2 years and then showed up at the outpatient clinic at the age of 18 years and 9 months, with a weight loss of 25.8 kg that had occurred over 21 months. At this time, her height, weight, and BMI were 168.3 cm (1.44 SDS), 54.3 kg (0.03 SDS), and 19.2 kg/m2 (25th percentile), respectively showing Tanner stage of III (). One month later, she presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea, orthopnea, anorexia, and general weakness. She had been not taking any medications for about 2 weeks. Her lips were cyanotic, her fingers clubbed, and her oxygen saturation was 88%. Laboratory findings revealed thrombocytopenia (a platelet count of 59,000/mm3) and a prolonged prothrombin time (17 seconds; reference range, 10–13 seconds), indicating liver dysfunction. She was severely dehydrated with hypernatremia (164 mmol/L) and increased serum and urine osmolarity (346 mosm/kg and 160 mosm/kg, respectively). She was treated with intravenous fluids, oral desmopressin, and a stress dose of intravenous hydrocortisone. Mesenteric hepatic Doppler ultrasonography and dynamic computed tomography of the liver demonstrated a reduced liver volume with an engorged portal vein and splenomegaly. Her hepatic vein wedge pressure was 21 mmHg (normal range, 1–5 mmHg) measured during transjugular liver biopsy, indicating portal hypertension. The liver biopsy identified micronodular cirrhosis (). In room air, oxygen saturation was 88% and 94% in sitting and lying positions, respectively. Her alveolar arterial oxygen gradient was 77, which was increased for her age (normal range, 5–10 mmHg). A bubble contrast echocardiography and lung perfusion scan suggested diffusely increased activity in the brain, kidneys, and spleen, which were consistent with a right to left shunt (). She was finally diagnosed with hepatopulmonary syndrome grade 3 due to liver cirrhosis induced by NAFLD, which was attributed to hypothalamic obesity after craniopharyngioma resection.
The patient was subsequently hospitalized three times because of aggravated dyspnea, revealing worsened grade 4 hepatopulmonary syndrome, dizziness with hypotension due to menorrhagia induced by thrombocytopenia, and hematemesis due to duodenal ulcer. She was followed up every 3 months with her prescribed hormone medications, including levothyroxine, prednisolone, desmopressin, recombinant human growth hormone, estrogen, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. At the age of 19 years, her height is 169.8 cm (1.72 SDS) and weight is 60.6 kg (0.86 SDS) with a BMI of 21.0 kg/m2 (25th–50th percentile) With metformin treatment, her hemoglobin A1c level has decreased to 5.0%, and her lipid profile has been normalized: total cholesterol 95 mg/dL and triglyceride 84 mg/dL (). Her AST and ALT levels have also been normalized, however, her prothrombin time is continuously prolonged, which is a sign of severe chronic cirrhosis of the liver. She has been registered as a candidate for cadaveric liver transplantation.

Various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prednisone, sulfasalazine, and two courses of anti-TNF alpha were prescribed earlier by her physician for symptomatic treatment.
At admission to our clinic, she presented with depressive symptoms and anxiety. She complained of weight loss (loss of 15 kg over a period of 1 to 2 months), diarrhea, weakness, and fatigue. She was severely cachexic with a significantly lower BMI (12.11 kg/m2). Physical examination revealed bilateral swelling of knee joints, skin rashes over the lower legs and the presence of pitting after applying pressure to pretibial areas. Movements of involved joints were painless and there was no definite restriction in the range of movements. The liver was palpated 1 cm below the costal margin in the right upper quadrant. Splenomegaly and enlargement of lymph nodes were not noticed.
Complete blood count at admission showed the following values: Hb: 11.2 g/dL, Hct: 32.6%, WBC: 7.500/mm3, Plt: 351.000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 4 mm/h, and the level of C-reactive protein was 13.6 mg/L. The routine biochemical tests revealed hyponatremia (126,6 mmol/L, normal: 135-145), hypokalemia (2.59 mmol/L, normal: 3.5-5.5), low ionized calcium (3.18 mg/dL, normal: 4.2-5.4), magnesium (1.37 mg/dL, normal: 1.9-2.7) and phosphate concentrations (1.2 mg/dL, normal: 2.6-4.5), severe hypoproteinemia (4.78 g/dL, normal: 6.4-8.3), hypoalbuminemia (1.2 g/dL, normal: 3.5-5.5), elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (298 U/L, normal: 38-155) and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (127 U/L, normal: 7-32). The other biochemical results were within normal limits and routine urine examination was normal. The patient had a 24-hour urinary protein collection, which showed a 24-hour protein measurement of 67.50 mg. This was confirmed on a repeat sample. Thyroid function tests showed FT3 level of 0.62 pg/mL at the lower limit of the normal range (normal: 0.60-1.95), decreased FT4 level of 4.40 ng/dL (normal: 5.00-11.50) and normal TSH concentration of 1.14 μIU/mL (normal: 0.30-4.00). The concentrations of PTH (230 pg/mL, normal: 10-65) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (4 ng/mL, normal: 10-40) were also measured. Electrophoresis of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes revealed elevated levels of liver isoenzyme. To view the status of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function synachten test was performed, which excluded the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The serological tests for various infectious agents (HBsAg, anti HBC, anti HIV 1+2, Treponemal tests, Brucella Ig G/M antibody levels, TORCH titers) were found to be negative. Ig G, A, M levels were within normal limits. AMA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, anti-LKM-1 were not detected. She was found to have positive ANA in a titer of 1/80 with granular and homogeneous pattern. Positive IgA endomysial antibody (1/80 titer) and IgG antigliaden antibody (98.50 RU/ml) levels were also detected.
Radiographs of involved joints revealed no evidence of bony erosions, chondrocalcinosis or deformity. Findings on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and chest radiograph, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography images were all normal. Abdominal ultrasonography displayed enlarged liver (155 mm in maximum cranial-caudal extent) and increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma (Grade 1). On thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomographic examination multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, with a largest diameter of 18 × 10 mm, were detected. DEXA scan of the lumbar spine and right hip showed low bone mineral density (BMD) with a total T score of - 5.7 and 4.9, respectively.
To examine the upper part of the gastrointestinal system esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, which revealed grade 1 esophagitis, hypotonic LES, gastritis, erosive bulbitis and hyperemia in the postbulbar duodenum. To confirm the initial diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease colonoscopy was performed. Findings other than nonspecific hyperemia of the ileal mucosa were not present. Multiple biopsies were obtained from both upper and lower gastrointestinal tract at the time of endoscopic evaluation. CD was histologically confirmed by duodenal biopsies, which revealed total villous atrophy of duodenal mucosa and regenerative hyperplasia. Increased cellularity of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the lamina propria and surface epithelium were observed. Histological examination of the excised tissue also revealed amorphous eosinophilic deposition in the lamina propria and in the wall of some vessels and glands, which was previously found typical for amyloid (Figure ). However, congo-red and crystal violet staining prosedures and immunohistochemical studies showed no amyloid protein. Neither kappa nor lambda monoclonality was detected in lymphoplasmocytoid cells, immunohistochemically. Loose light-green staining of the deposition by trichrome staining was the unique positive finding (Figure ). In the light of these findings, collagenous sprue due to long-standing celiac disease was the last diagnosis, histologically. Specimens obtained from terminal ileum revealed chronic inflammation and subtotal villous atrophy of ileal mucosa.
Our patient suffered from anorexia and poor oral intake. To increase caloric intake to gain weight total parenteral nutrition was administered by cyclic infusions. After several days diarrhea improved. She was asked to avoid taking gluten and her complaints abated and did not persist.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 78.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 125.0 mg/dL.

In 1998, the patient was hospitalized for a non-ST elevated myocardial infarction with documentation of severe three vessel coronary diseases. Echocardiography showed hypertrophic left ventricle with anterior and lateral hypokinesia and slightly reduced ejection fraction (50%). The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafts with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) on left anterior descending (LAD), and saphenous vein graft (SVG) on obtuse marginal (OM)1 and on right coronary artery (RCA). Follow-up was uneventful until 2013, when the patient was again hospitalized for unstable angina. On this occasion, he reported classical symptoms of angina [Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class III] in the last 6 months and more recently typical chest pain episodes at rest lasting 15 min and responsive to nitrates. Echocardiography was slightly worsened with akinesia of the anterior apex and hypokinesia of the anterolateral wall. Considering the high-risk profile and the symptoms, we decided to perform coronary artery angiography that showed: functional LIMA occlusion, occlusion of the SVG for RCA, and critical stenosis of the SVG for OM1 with LAD, RCA, and OM1 occlusion (Figure ). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on LAD was performed with single drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation and on SVG for OM1 with DES implantation (Figure ). Patient was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), perindopril 5 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, doxazosin 2 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg. A low dosage of selective β-blocker (bisoprolol 1.25 mg) was added [blood pressure (BP) 120/80 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 86 b.p.m.]. The patient was already on tiotropium 18 mcg for his COPD. After 5 years, the patient came to our attention for worsening effort angina (CCS III). A myocardial perfusion scintigraphy showed anterior and lateral ischaemia involving 18–20% of the left ventricular mass. In the meanwhile, diabetes mellitus type II was diagnosed and CKD worsened becoming severe (GFR 28 mL/min). Thus, perindopril was withdrawn and doxazosin was uptitrated to 4 mg as well as bisoprolol to 2.5 mg (BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 82 b.p.m.). Coronary artery angiography showed in-stent occlusive restenosis of LAD, critical stenosis of the SVG for OM1 due to distal progression of the disease (Figure ). Saphenous vein graft for OM1 was treated with another DES (Figure ), while an unsuccessful attempt of PCI was performed on LAD. We uptitrated bisoprolol to 5 mg (BP 120/70 mmHg, HR 80 b.p.m.).

The patient reported feeling ill for the prior 10 days with progressively worsening symptoms of fatigue, fever, myalgias, and diarrhea. The patient was a hospital employee and tested positive for COVID-19 four days prior to the ED visit. Upon arrival to the ED he was found to be hypoxic to 90% on room air, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minutes, tachycardic with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, afebrile with oral temperature of 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and blood pressure of 125/75 millimeters mercury. On physical exam the patient was ill-appearing with increased work of breathing, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, and bilateral calf tenderness to palpation. Laboratory evaluation showed an elevated D-dimer of 465 ng/ml (with a normal cutoff value of 229 ng/ml). A point-of-care lower extremity duplex compression ultrasound demonstrated turbulent blood flow in the right lower extremity ().
A right calf vein thrombosis was noted distal to the trifurcation. (This was an incidental finding as calf vein imaging is not part of the compression ultrasound protocol.) A CTA was negative for PE but showed bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen, started on enoxaparin and admitted to the hospital. He was admitted for four days with improvement and discharged home on anticoagulation. The patient returned to the ED five days later with worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and chest pain. A CTA again demonstrated no PE. D-dimer at that time was 31,876 ng/ml. During the second admission, a subsequent comprehensive ultrasound demonstrated a persistent calf vein thrombosis, and the patient’s D-dimer continued to downtrend but was significantly higher than on the prior visit. Radiology did not comment on the turbulent flow finding; however, upon retrospective review of these images, the patient continued to have turbulent flow in the deep venous system of the lower extremity. His oxygen requirements continued to escalate along with the deterioration of his hemodynamics.

Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are reported to be present and so three points are added to the score, making the current total 0 + 3 = 3. Pulmonary Embolism is not reported to be the #1 diagnosis and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3.
The patient's heart rate is 102.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5.
Because the patient has had an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0.
The patient not been diagnosed with pulmonary embolis (PE), but the patient has previously been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 6.0 + 1.5 = 7.5.
Hemoptysis is not reported in the patient note and so we assume that it is missing from the patient, keeping the total score at 7.5.
Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 7.5.

The patient denied having similar symptoms in the past or any history of abdominal surgery. He had an upper gastrointestinal series 10 years ago, which was unremarkable except for a hiatal hernia. He is a body builder and admitted to the use of AAS. He was 1500 mg of testosterone/nandrolone, via intramuscular injection, per week for 3 months. 3 weeks prior to the presentation, he abruptly decreased the dose to 500 mg/week.
On presentation, he was found to be diaphoretic, in mild distress, with tachycardia at 100 beats/min and tenderness in the suprapubic region with no guarding, rebound tenderness or palpable masses. Laboratory studies were normal apart from an increased white blood cell count at 15.0, increased hemoglobin at 17.9 and increased hematocrit at 51.2%. He had mild changes in sodium (134), as well as blood urea nitrogen (24). He weighed 265 pounds, with a body mass index of 40.3. A computer tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated mild diffuse nonspecific colonic wall thickening, with two separate areas of apparent short segment small bowel intussusception without evidence of obstruction [Figures –]. In addition, a small umbilical hernia containing fat was visualized. Our patient was subsequently medically managed, with pain control and hydration. A colonoscopy completed the day after admission demonstrated edema and erythema in the distal ileum and colon, most densely starting in the distal transverse colon and increasing within the rectum. There were no ulcers, polyps, tumors or sites of hemorrhage noted. Biopsies were taken from each section of the colon. The subsequent pathological evaluation indicated acute and chronic colitis from the descending colon forward and changes suggesting ischemic colitis in the rectum [Figures –].
A follow-up CT scan was completed on the third day of admission but demonstrated no definitive intussusceptions []. There was no longer any overt colitis evidenced though there may have been an underlying inflammatory process based on submucosal lucency in the transverse colon. With the apparent resolution of the small bowel intussusceptions with conservative medical management, accompanied by a resolution of the patient's pain, he was discharged home.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.,"{'age': [34, 'years'], 'weight': [265.0, 'lbs'], 'sex': 'Male', 'Sodium': [134.0, 'mEq/L']}",-3.09,-3.24,-2.94,"The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.
The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 34 years old. The patient's is a Male.
The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult male's the total body water percentage value is 0.60.
The patient's weight is 265.0 lbs so this converts to 265.0 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 120.202 kg. The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mEq. To convert from 134.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 134.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 134.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 134.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 134.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 120.202 * (134.0/140 - 1) = -3.09 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -3.09 L."
7482,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-3127315-1,Extracted,"An 18-year-old female patient with body weight 145 kg, height 164 cm, and body -mass index (BMI) 53.9 was posted for LSG. Preoperatively, her blood pressure was 118/68 mmHg, pulse 70/min, temperature 36.8°C, and she had a history of occasional attacks of bronchial asthma (seasonal). Her preoperative SaO2 % on room air was 99%, and there was no history suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea. Her pre-operative investigations did not reveal any abnormality except a large fatty liver. She was pre-medicated with omeprazole 40 mg IV and metoclopramide 10 mg IV 2h before surgery and midazolam 2 mg IV was administered in the receiving area of the operation theatre. She had received 3500 IU of tinaparin 2 h earlier. Graduated compression stockings were applied before the surgery. Ceftriaxone1000 mg was administered intravenously an hour prior to the surgery.
On arrival to the operation room, the monitors were attached and she was pre-oxygenated for 2 min. Anaesthesia was induced, with the patient in the 30° anti-trendelenberg position, with IV fentanyl 100 μg, IV lignocaine 60mg, IV propofol 200mg, and cisatracurium 18mg. Her trachea was intubated with a 7 mm ID oro-tracheal cuffed Portex tube. Anaesthesia was maintained with 80% oxygen, sevoflurane (end-tidal 2%), alfentanil infusion, and intermittent doses of cisatracurium, as required. The lungs were ventilated with tidal volume of 500 ml, at the rate of 14-18/min and PEEP of 7 cm of H2O using a low flow technique. ECG, NIBP, SaO2 %, end-tidal CO2, nasopharyngeal temperature, and TOF were monitored. She received 2000 ml of lactated Ringer's solution and 500 ml of 6% hydroxyl-ethyl starch (Haesteril 6%, Fresenius Kabi); during anaesthesia which lasted for 120 min.
Almost 20 min after induction of anaesthesia, when the patient was positioned for surgery, fentanyl 50 μg IV bolus was administered while the surgeon introduced the Veress needle through the upper left quadrant of the abdomen in the supine position. The intra-peritoneal insufflation using CO2 was started with high flows to achieve intra-abdominal pressure of 20 mmHg. Within less than 1 min, the end-tidal CO2 dropped from 35 to 9 mmHg, the patient was cyanosed and SaO2 % dropped to 67%. Her heart rate increased to 130/min from 78/min. However, her arterial blood pressure was maintained at 128/78 mmHg. The airway pressure was between 32 and 35 cm of H2O.
Gas embolism was suspected and the surgeon was informed immediately. FiO2 was increased to 1, fresh gas flow increased to 8L/min, sevoflurane stopped, and manual bag ventilation was carried out. The surgeon stopped the insufflation. Tredelenburg position was given immediately and intravenous 6% hydroxyl-ethyl starch was infused fast to raise the venous pressure to prevent further entrainment of the gas. Within 5 min SaO2 % increased to 100%, and end-tidal CO2 increased to 25 mmHg and later to 42 mmHg. The auscultation of chest revealed bilateral good and equal air entry, which excluded pneumothorax, and no mill-wheel murmur was detected. The pupils were bilaterally equal, small and reacting well to light. When heart rate dropped to 110/min, sevoflurane and alfentanil infusion 500 μg/h were resumed. Arterial blood gas analysis 15 min after the insult showed respiratory acidosis: pH 7.24, PCO2 67mmHg, PO2 220 mmHg, HCO3 28.5 mmol/L. FiO2 was decreased to 0.7 at this stage.
After almost 30 min, after the patient was stabilized, the surgeon directed the Veress needle more caudad and insufflated at lower flows to achieve the pressure of 10 mmHg under vision. A small hole on the anterior surface of the left lobe of the liver could be seen from where the gas was being entrained [Figures and ]. The surgeon covered this bleeding hole with a wet gauze [Figures and ] and applied pressure laparoscopically and later sealed it with surgicel. Since there was no further entrainment of the gas, he carried out the surgery uneventfully.
The arterial blood gas analysis after 1 h from the insult showed complete recovery: pH 7.36, PCO2 42 mmHg, PO2 147 mmHg, HCO3 23.2 mmol/L; though the airway pressure maintained between 32 and 35 cm of H2O and the heart rate was consistently around 110/min throughout the surgery.
At the end of the operation the neuromuscular blockade was reversed with atropine 1mg and neostigmine 2.5mg. The trachea was extubated when the T1:T4 ratio reached 87% and she was completely awake.
The patient stayed in the PACU (post anaesthesia care unit) for 2 h under complete monitoring and observation. She was vitally stable. Blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, SaO2 % was 100% on O2 6 L/min through Hudson's mask, and 96% on room air. The pulse rate was 90-110/min and the respiratory rate was 16-18/min. Pain was relieved by IV infusion of paracetamol (Perfalgan, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd) 1G and small boluses of IV pethidine.
The patient was shifted to the ward in stable condition under observation of vital signs and SaO2 % in the ward. O2 6 L/min through Hudson's facemask was given for 24 h. Incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy were begun within 4 h after the surgery. The patient was discharged home after 2 days without any complications.",What is the patient's body surface area?

Her past medical history included significant weight loss, dysphagia, and anorexia 1 year prior to admission which was diagnosed as oesophageal carcinoma which was treated by oesophageal stenting 5 months prior to admission. On admission, the patient was in moderate distress with the following vital signs: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, pulse: 130 b.p.m., temperature 37°C, and respiratory rate 25 b.p.m. Precordial examination revealed distant heart sounds. Chest examination revealed bilateral diminished air entry over both lung bases. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions (PACs), low voltage, and subtle electrical alternans (Figure ).
As a first line imaging modality, we selected a transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated a metallic shadow behind the left atrium (oesophageal stent) (Figure , , Movie S1, Figure , , Movie S2). It also revealed a massive circumferential pericardial effusion (that was mainly posterior and lateral and measured 3 cm and 2.8 cm, respectively) as well as large left pleural effusion (Figure , , Movie S1).The inferior vena cava (IVC) was dilated (2.6 cm) and it did not show adequate inspiratory collapse (Figure ). Apart from significant respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow (Figures and ), the echocardiographic features of tamponade were absent. We decided to apply the triage chart proposed by the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on myocardial and pericardial diseases to calculate the pericardiocentesis score. Despite that the patient was normotensive, the pericardiocentesis score was 13.5 ().
So urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with tapping of about 500 mL haemorrhagic fluid followed by immediate and marked improvement of symptoms and tachycardia (heart rate dropped to 100).

His symptoms had begun 2 weeks prior to admission, with abdominal pain and an erythematous pinpoint rash on his arms. The rash developed from his upper limbs (opisthenar and arms) to his lower limbs. Laboratory examination in the outpatient clinic revealed no abnormalities in indicators such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. After oral medication (specific unknown), his abdominal symptoms began to reduce, as did the purpura. Ten days prior, the rash progressed mostly on the legs, and he experienced deeper abdominal pain in the form of persistent pain with abdominal gassiness and emesis. He was admitted to another hospital with a diagnosis of HSP. Seven days prior, he had melena. After fasting and fluid replacement, there was no obvious improvement in the symptoms. Half a day prior, his face and lips appeared pale, and he had increased abdominal pain, accompanied by numerous bloody stools and hematemesis. He was immediately treated with methylprednisolone, posterior pituitary injection, somatostatin, and hemocoagulase, together with the infusion of large blood products (Table ). At this stage, the patient still produced large amounts of blood in the vomit and stool. His vital signs were extremely unstable, and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital. The patient had purpura with lower limb predominance and abdominal pain (consistent with one of the following 4 criteria: abdominal pain, histopathology, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement), and was diagnosed with HSP.[
On admission, he had severe anemia, with a blood pressure of 76/44 mm Hg, pulse of 135 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. There was also a palpable purpura rash on both legs, tenderness in the abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds. Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L, white blood cell count of 11.48 × 109/L, and platelet count of 13 × 109/L. The liver function test showed albumin 10 g/L. The serum electrolytes showed sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 2.92 mmol/L, chloride 112.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.9 mmol/L (Table ) with coagulopathy. Therefore, HSP complicated with an alimentary tract hemorrhage was diagnosed. He was immediately treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day), infusion of blood products, and somatostatin but after 2 days after treatment (day 3), he still had massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, poor circulation, a reduced level of consciousness, and unstable vital signs. Abdominal ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiography revealed no enterobrosis. The patient was also evaluated by pediatric surgeons, and the continuation of medical treatment was suggested. However, his condition deteriorated, and he needed to rely on a life-supporting blood transfusion. He developed signs of peritonitis with abdominal distension. Gastrointestinal tract perforation was suspected. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole abdomen revealed curved liquid samples and gas shadows on the left and front of the stomach, supporting the possibility of gastrointestinal tract perforation (Fig. ). On day 4, an emergency laparotomy was performed. The surgery revealed that the anterior wall of the descending duodenum was thinner with a 1 cm × 1 cm diameter perforation, and the posterior wall had a 3 cm × 1 cm ulcer, which had penetrated into the peritoneum of the pancreas and experienced active bleeding from the broken end of the vessel. The intraoperative hemorrhage volume was approximately 3000 mL, including intragastric bleeding and intestinal blood clots. Pathological examination indicated chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall mucosa in the descending part of the stomach and duodenum, with hemorrhage, ulceration, interstitial congestion, and edema. Immunofluorescence microscopy of paraffin sections showed granular and lumpy IgA focal deposition in the blood vessel walls (Fig. ). Postoperatively, he was administered nasal continuous positive airway pressure-assisted ventilation, anti-infection treatment, albumin transfusion, platelet transfusion, abdominal drainage, methylprednisolone, fluconazole antifungal treatment, and wound dressing. The general symptoms gradually improved, vital signs were stable, and abdominal pain was relieved. The drainage tube was assessed after discharge, the abdominal CT was repeated after 1 month and the duodenostomy tube was removed 50 days after surgery. There was no evidence of rebleeding during the 2-month follow-up assessment.",What is the patient's delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [112.1, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [15.9, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [140.0, 'mmol/L']}",0,0,0,"The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 112.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 112.1 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.1 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.1 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.1 mmol chloride/L converts to 112.1 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 15.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 15.9 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 15.9 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 15.9 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 15.9 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 15.9 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (112.1 mEq/L + 15.9 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 0 mEq/L / 8.1 mEq/L = 0. The patient's delta ratio is 0."

The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. Because of the right bundle branch block was not previously known, a new troponin test was performed six hours later with a peak value of 4.28 ng/mL. Treatment with crystalloids, continuous infusion of intravenous insulin, and administration of potassium and sodium bicarbonate were begun in the emergency room (ER). Due to a poor response over the first two hours, with the persistence of lactic acidosis, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where more aggressive rehydration with crystalloids was started, without further modifications of the original therapeutic plan.
Two days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the endocrinology ward. Because of his coronary risk factors and the elevated troponin on admission, a coronary angiography was performed, showing triple-vessel disease. Successful bypass surgery without extracorporeal circulation was performed a few days later, with internal mammary artery grafts to the anterior descendent and marginal obtuse arteries and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.

He had no history of previous medical disorders, and had never had a blood transfusion. He had not taken any kind of medication prior to manifestation of symptoms and was neither an alcoholic nor a heavy drinker. The patient's blood pressure was 126/77 mm Hg, his pulse rate was 87 beats/min, his respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36℃.His initial hemoglobin level was 14 g/dL, his hematocrit was 43.8% and his white blood cell count (WBC) was 4,400×103/µL. His platelet count was observed to be low, at 16×103/µL. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were both not observed during physical examination. Mild hepatosplenomegaly was seen in his liver scan accompanied by reticuloendothelial system dysfunction. Increased numbers of megakaryocytes were seen in the result of the patient's bone marrow aspiration (). He was diagnosed with ITP, and the patient started treatment with high-dose oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, and his platelet count level subsequently rose to 204×103/µL. He was discharged and visited our outpatient clinic routinely for the next 6 months, continuing with low-dose oral prednisolone tapered to 5 mg.
Seven months later, during a routine visit to the clinic he complained that his face had developed a yellowish color. Upon physical examination, icteric sclera and anemic conjunctiva were revealed. Upon laboratory examination, his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were observed to be 7.0 g/dL and 23.2%, respectively. His WBC and platelet counts were found to be 4,400/µL and 241×103/µL, respectively. His corrected reticulocyte count was 8.3% and reticulocyte production index (RPI) was 4.1. His total and direct bilirubin concentrations were observed to be 4.5 mg/dL and 0.6 mg/dL respectively. His lactate dehydrogenase concentration was high, at 937 IU/L, and his serum haptoglobin had decreased to 10 mg/dL. Acidified sucrose lysis (Ham's test), antinuclear antibody, and anti-dsDNA antibody tests all produced negative results. Both direct and indirect Coombs' tests both produced negative results. Flow cytometry for red blood cell CD55 and CD59 were 99.8% (neutrophil 99.1%) and 99.9% (neutrophil 99.9%), respectively. Peripheral blood smear revealed macrocytic normochromic anemia (). A bone marrow biopsy was repeated, which revealed normocellular marrow with increased erythroid and megakaryopoiesis (). Based on these findings, we concluded that the patient suffered from ITP and Coombs' negative AIHA. Since there is a well known association between LPDs and AIHA, an F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) scan was conducted to investigate possible occurrence of LPDs, however, there was no sign of malignancy (). He was treated with a higher dosage of oral prednisolone of one [] mg/kg/day for 5 weeks. We attempted to taper the prednisolone dosage, but his hemoglobin level fluctuated in proportion to the dose. We determined that the patient was developing a steroid dependency and a resulting laparoscopic splenectomy was performed in November 2006. After the operation, his hemoglobin level and platelet count slowly increased and reached normal range. His hemoglobin level was 13.8 g/dL and his platelet count was 301×103/µL. We stopped the steroid treatment.
During a routine clinic visit four months later, the patient complained of a yellowish face color again. He also had a newly developed, palpable lymph node on the right side of his neck. His hemoglobin count had decreased to 7.4 g/dL and his platelet count had increased to 529×103/µL. His corrected reticulocyte count was 6.6% and his RPI was 3.3. His lactate dehydrogenase concentration had increased to 1,088 IU/L and his serum haptoglobin had fallen to 21.1 mg/dL. Direct and indirect Coombs' test results were again, both negative. A peripheral blood smear revealed macrocytic and normochromic erythrocytes with mild anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. His chest radiograph, taken on admission, revealed a right hilar prominence which was not apparent in the chest radiograph taken 4 months before. A chest CT scan and F-18 FDG PET/CT scan confirmed enlarged lymph nodes in the right hilum, mediastinum, and right neck (). A biopsy was performed using the enlarged lymph node on the right side of his neck, revealing diffuse proliferation of medium to large atypical lymphoid cells (). The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow, but no evidence of malignant lymphoma. He was treated with 8 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP). After the 8 cycles of chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved. The patient is still visiting our outpatient clinic regularly. Full blood count, including reticulocytes, and blood films have all remained within normal limits.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [36.0, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [87.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [22.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [4400.0, 'µL']}",3,3,3,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 36.0 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 87.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 4400.0 count/µL. To convert 4400.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 4400.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 4400000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3."
7360,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4273471-1,Extracted,"GK is a 43-year-old right-hand dominant nonsmoking female who presented to our office with right shoulder pain. The patient had symptoms for nine months following a motor-vehicle accident where she was a restrained passenger. The patient stated she had severe pain at the anterolateral aspect of her right shoulder, difficulty lifting greater than five pounds, limited overhead motion, and subjective catching. Physical examination showed her height, weight, and body mass index were 61 inches, 135 pounds, and 25.51, respectively. After history, physical, and radiographic examination, the patient was diagnosed with a rotator cuff strain, long head biceps tenosynovitis, and acromioclavicular joint osteolysis. Over the course of one year, the patient attended 36 sessions of physical therapy, participated in a home exercise program and underwent a subacromial cortisone injection with only temporary relief. Due to her lack of progress with conservative measures, an MRI arthrogram was obtained which showed a moderate bursal-sided tear of the supraspinatus, moderate acromioclavicular joint osteolysis, and a type II superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesion. A discussion of nonoperative versus operative treatment options, outcomes, and complications occurred and the patient elected to go forward with surgery.
After being brought into the operating room, the patient underwent an interscalene nerve block for intraoperative and postoperative pain control using a nerve stimulator. Bilateral lower extremity sequential compression devices were applied for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. General endotracheal tube anesthesia (GETA) was administered. The patient was then positioned into the modified lateral decubitus position (patient rolled back 30 degrees) using a foam wedge with all bony prominences well padded. An axillary roll was placed one hand breadth distal to the axilla, and the patient was secured with Velcro straps. After sterile draping and time-out, the patient's operative extremity was placed in ten pounds of balanced suspension in the scapular plane.
Upon shoulder arthroscopy, the patient was found to have a type II SLAP lesion with a long head biceps that had inflammation and fraying. The articular side of the rotator cuff had mild fraying. When viewing the subacromial space, the patient's rotator cuff was found to have significant fraying, fragmentation, and thinning of the bursal side (type A1, B3). When probed, the supraspinatus was found to be of inadequate quality due to intrasubstance tearing. In addition, the acromioclavicular joint was arthritic. As a result, the patient underwent an arthroscopic take-down and repair of the rotator cuff, a distal clavicle excision, and a miniopen subpectoralis long head biceps tenodesis. The duration of the surgery was one hour and 45 minutes with the duration of balanced suspension one hour and 20 minutes. There were no complications intraoperatively. The patient was placed into a sling with an abduction pillow and awoken from the anesthesia with no incident. She was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.
At her initial postoperative visit six days after surgery, the patient presented with occasional pain in her shoulder with moderate swelling. She denied nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and sweats and had no calf tenderness. She was not menopausal. She was taking Percocet as needed as with appropriate relief but otherwise denied any additional medication history. Her incisions were clean and dry, and the stitches were removed and steri-strips applied. The patient was instructed to continue wearing her sling and abduction pillow except when performing twice daily Codman's exercises. Exercises for elbow, wrist, and finger range of motion were demonstrated, and the patient was advised to perform these twice per day.
At four weeks postoperatively, the patient's pain was well-controlled with no requirement for pain medication, and her wounds were well-healed. She denied fevers, chills, and calf pain. Her sling was discontinued and formal physical therapy was initiated as per our standard rotator cuff repair and biceps tenodesis protocol.
41 days postoperatively, the patient called our office with new-onset right-hand swelling and trouble breathing. She also reported that she had been feeling “flu-like symptoms” and stomach pains. She had no calf pain or lower extremity swelling. The patient was able to send our office a picture of her swollen hand over a secure email service with patient identification removed (). After seeing the photograph, she was advised to immediately follow up with us where upper extremity swelling and slightly labored breathing were confirmed.
Vital signs were stable and we ordered a stat computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram, which revealed that the patient had an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the subsegmental posterior basal segment artery of the right lower lobe (). A stat hematology consult was arranged, and the patient was admitted through the emergency room to the hematology service for further evaluation and management. The patient was started on a therapeutic dose of Lovenox and subsequently transitioned to per-oral Xarelto. Three days after admission, she underwent a bilateral upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound that was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An immediate ultrasound upon admission was not performed due to the hematologist service's need to stabilize the patient prior to additional testing. She had no pain, swelling, or tenderness in the left upper extremity or bilateral lower extremities. A full hematology analysis was performed and was negative for any predisposing genetic factors for VTE. In assessing the patient's objective risk factors for VTE, a Revised Geneva Score was calculated and resulted in a score of two, corresponding to low risk for DVT [].
Three days after initiation of anticoagulation therapy, the patient's constitutional symptoms and discomfort with breathing resolved. Two weeks later, her upper extremity swelling resolved. Although her preoperative pain was completely resolved, the patient developed postoperative stiffness, and at six months postoperatively she had a protracted humeral head with active forward elevation 130 degrees, external rotation 45 degrees, and internal rotation to L5. Her strength with regard to her supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and biceps was 5/5 with no pain, and a postoperative MRI at 6 months postoperatively showed complete healing of the supraspinatus repair and long head biceps tenodesis.",What is the patient's body surface area?

8492,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-6287602-1,Extracted,"A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Nephrology, Kansai Electric Power Hospital on January 14, 2014, for proteinuria. He had been followed up for hypertension and dyslipidemia in a local clinic since the age of 50. He had experienced several vascular events, such as total occlusion in the common iliac artery at the age of 63 and two histories of cerebral infarction at the ages of 70 and 77. He had 30 years of smoking history but no alcohol habit. He had no family history of kidney disease except for one cousin showing end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology. During his initial admission to our hospital, his urine protein level was 5.4 g/g Cr, and serum albumin was 3.2 g/dL; he was discharged because his condition was stable. Ten months later, edema of his lower limbs worsened, and renal biopsy was performed on his second admission.
On the second hospitalization, physical examination showed the following: height of 169 cm, weight of 70 kg, body mass index of 24.5, and blood pressure of 180/88 mmHg. Laboratory findings revealed a nephrotic range of urine protein, 9.15 g/g Cr accompanying microscopic hematuria of dysmorphic 10 – 19 RBC/HPF, and total serum protein and albumin of 4.8 and 1.8 g/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine was 0.95 mg/dL, AST was 29 IU/L, ALT was 14 IU/L, and ALP was 188 IU/L. Serological examination revealed serum IgG, IgA, and IgM of 875, 344, and 52 mg/dL, respectively. Antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.
Lipid analysis revealed elevated total cholesterol (259 mg/dL), triglyceride (376 mg/dL), and LDL cholesterol (167 mg/dL) levels, and a low HDL cholesterol level (45 mg/dL). The serum ApoE level was 13.6 mg/dL (normal range: 2.8 – 4.6 mg/dL). An oral glucose tolerance test showed no abnormality, and his hemoglobin A1c was 5.7%. Although hypertriglyceridemia was marked, systemic abnormalities characteristic of hyperlipidemia, such as corneal opacities, xanthoma, and Achilles tendon hypertrophy, were not found. Moreover, the patient had no family history of hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus.
Light microscopy (LM) revealed that the specimens contained 27 glomeruli, 8 of which showed global sclerosis (29.6%). Most glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis, infiltration of foam cells containing lipid deposits in capillary lumen (a). In periodic methenamine silver (PAM)-stained sections, spike formation and bubbling were detected on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (c, d). Mild to severe arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis were also seen. Fibrosis was observed in ~ 20% of the whole interstitial area. Intriguingly, Sudan III staining was strongly positive not only in the mesangial and infiltrating foam cells but also in the focal capillary lumen in the glomerulus (b). Immunofluorescence (IF) studies demonstrated subtle granular staining for IgG along the capillary wall; however, C3 was not detected (data not shown). Electron microscopic (EM) findings analysis showed electron-dense deposits (EDDs) with a variety of densities and distributions. Highly-dense deposits accompanied by spike formation identical to MN were seen in the subepithelial area (a, b). In the subendothelial area, highly dense EDDs were detected but in higher magnification, and microbubbles were contained (a, b). Effacement of foot process was also accompanied with these depositions. In addition, EM findings demonstrated that the capillary lumina was filled with lipid deposits that did not show lamellar formation similar to “lipid thrombi” in LPG.
Plasma ApoE phenotypes were analyzed by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis as previously reported [, ]. The patient’s sample showed the position of ApoE2/2 (a, Lane 1).
The APOE genotype was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis as described previously [, ]. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme HhaI. Genotype ε2/2 in the patient was identified by 91- and 83-bp fragments (b, Lane 1). The ApoE Toyonaka (Ser197Cys) as shown in d was also confirmed by RFLP analysis digested with SacI (c). Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers, sense 5′-CGTGCGGGCCGCCACTGTGAGCT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCGCATGGCTGCAGGCTTCGGCGTTC-3′. The 335-bp fragment after cleavage by SacI suggested normal c.644C of ApoE in codon 197 (Lane 3). The 358- and 335-bp fragments after cleavage by SacI showed a heterozygous novel mutation of ApoE Toyonaka (Lane 2). Direct sequencing of APOE DNA was performed as described previously []. Based on the results, we identified a homozygous polymorphism at codon 158 (e2/2: c.526 C>T: Arg158Cys) (data not shown) and a heterozygous missense mutation (C to G) in exon 4 leading to an amino acid substitution Cys (TGC) for Ser (TCC) at codon 197 (c.644 C>G: p.S215C: Ser197Cys) (d). All these findings were the same as that of a previous case of ApoE2/2 and ApoE Toyonaka showing MN-like glomerular histology [6].
For hypertriglyceridemia, fibrate 400 mg/day was started. Obtaining the results of the IF and EM studies, which did not deny immune-related MN like lesions, PSL 10 mg/day and cyclosporine (CyA) 75 mg/day for NS were started. These treatments brought about a substantial improvement of hypertriglyceridemia and complete remission of NS by 300 days after admission. During maintenance therapy with oral PSL 5 mg and CyA 75 mg/day, he had cerebral infarction and aspiration pneumonia. After withdrawal of CyA, his NS relapsed with an increase of proteinuria more than 1 g/day.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [70.0, 'kg'], 'height': [169.0, 'cm']}",67.018,63.667,70.369,"The patient's gender is Male.

He was an active gentleman, often completing several rounds of golf per week.
Medications included: warfarin, clopidogrel 75 mg OD, losartan 25 mg OD, atorvastatin 20 mg OD, prednisolone 60 mg OD, gliclazide 240 mg/40 mg BD, and linagliptin 5 mg OD.
At presentation, his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate 72 b.p.m., respiratory rate 25 b.p.m., oxygen saturations 100% on air, and he had a temperature of 37.7°C. On physical examination, he appeared breathless on minimal exertion, had fine right basal crepitations, a pan-systolic and early diastolic murmur, and bilateral mild pitting oedema. Initial laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 117 g/L, white cell count of 11.57 × 109/L (neutrophil count 9.26 × 109/L), C-reactive protein 11 mg/L, and creatinine 96 μmol/L [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 72 mL/min].
The primary components of the admission differential diagnosis included: infective endocarditis, aortic valve dehiscence or thrombosis, congestive cardiac failure of alternative cause, and pneumonia.
Urgent echocardiography was performed which demonstrated dehiscence of the aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation. On 2D echo imaging, a hypoechoic tract could be visualized from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) to the RA (Figure ). The suspicion of a Gerbode defect was confirmed on colour flow mapping, with a large jet demonstrated between the two chambers (Figure and C).

She had an underlying disease of diabetes and hypertension for 10 years and had been treated with medications at the local clinic, which included metformin, glimepiride, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and atorvastatin. She also had severe osteoarthritis at both knee joints and had multiple steroid injections at the local orthopedic clinic. Approximately 2 weeks before admission, she had been admitted for treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). At that time, blood culture and urine culture showed growth of Escherichia coli and was treated with ceftriaxone and tazobactam. She was not on any antihypertensive medication for 2 weeks.
Physical examination showed the following findings: height 152 cm, body weight 57 kg, blood pressure 70/50 mmHg, heart rate 70 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 20 per minute, with body temperature 36.5°C. Decreased skin and tongue turgor were observed. Pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.
shows the laboratory data at admission and those 2 weeks before admission. Her outpatient laboratory data checked at 2 weeks prior to admission showed normal levels of serum creatinine and calcium. Serum magnesium level decreased to a lower limit of normal range at admission. Fractional excretion of sodium was 1.0%.
Having pyuria and hypotension, with a previous history of UTI, she was first diagnosed as UTI sepsis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and antibiotics and massive hydration (30 mL/kg of crystalloids) were administered. The patient’s vital signs were stabilized after administration of crystalloids. Within 2 days, inflammatory signs and blood pressure were normalized. However, serum calcium and creatinine levels remained elevated, and the patient constantly complained about poor oral intake and general weakness.
On the third hospital day, administration of saline and calcitonin (40 IU per day) was begun. Serum calcium level decreased for the next 2 days (from 11.9 to 9.9 mg/dL) but began to increase again from the third day of calcitonin administration.
To evaluate the cause of hypercalcemia, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of chest and abdomen and whole body bone scintigraphy were performed, but the results showed no evidence of malignancy. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers, and tumor marker studies were negative. Thyroid function profile revealed normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (0.68 μIU/L, normal range: 0.34–0.56 μIU/L) and free thyroxine (1.12 ng/dL, normal range: 0.58–1.64 ng/dL). The bone mineral density T-score was –1.4, which indicated osteopenia. Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 7.5 pg/mL (normal range: 12–88 pg/mL), PTH-related peptide was undetectable (normal range: <1.1 pmol/L), and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was 16.32 ng/mL (normal range: 30–100 ng/mL). These results indicated a suppressed PTH–vitamin D axis.
We found that the patient had multiple steroid injections in both her knee joints in the past, although the amount of steroid could not be quantified. Adrenocortical function was assessed, and showed that her serum cortisol level was 2.36 μg/dL and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 32.51 pg/mL (normal range: 10–60 pg/mL). The ACTH stimulation test showed inadequate cortisol response to the pharmacological dose of ACTH (). As most people with secondary adrenal insufficiency fall within the range limit and usually below 35, the plasma ACTH level and ACTH stimulation test results suggested the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone (1.5 mg/kg) was administered from the tenth hospital day. Her serum calcium level returned to normal within 3 days and her general weakness and anorexia were completely improved (). With the normalization of calcium level, magnesium level trended toward normal range. After 2 weeks of follow-up, serum calcium level was maintained at 8.7 mg/dL. As the patient was at a high risk of developing osteoporosis and needed corticosteroid replacement, regular monitoring for bone mineral density was considered, but the patient was lost for follow-up.",What is the patient's body surface area?

His medical history included atrial fibrillation and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had no known history of food or drug allergy. He did not drink but had smoked 40 cigarettes per day since at the age of 20 years. His family history was unremarkable. Despite receiving first-line chemotherapy (bevacizumab combined with pemetrexed plus cisplatin followed by maintenance pemetrexed infusion), the lung cancer progressed. Thus, nivolumab was initiated at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in April 2016. His baseline serum creatinine level before nivolumab therapy was 1.2 mg/dl, and red or white blood cells were not noted in urinalysis. Owing to general fatigue and appetite loss, 10 mg oral prednisolone daily was initiated in July 2016. Four months later, when the oral prednisolone treatment was tapered to 5 mg daily, sterile pyuria was noted and the creatinine level increased to 1.64 mg/dl. Since his creatinine level continued to increase, nivolumab was discontinued (a total of 19 cycles had been performed), and the patient was referred to the nephrology department in January 2017.

He had been receiving lansoprazole for more than 4 years without significant adverse effects, including kidney injury. He denied using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other nephrotoxic agents. His weight was 49.9 kg, height was 168 cm, body temperature was 36.7 °C, pulse rate was 84/min with an irregular rhythm, and blood pressure was 102/60 mmHg. Breath sounds were reduced in the left lower lung field. His heart sounds were normal without audible murmurs. The liver, spleen, and kidneys were not palpable. Tenderness in the costovertebral angle was unclear. Skin rash, joint pain, or swelling was absent, and the oral mucosa was intact. No neurological abnormalities were noted. Laboratory investigations showed blood urea nitrogen value of 23.2 mg/dl, creatinine level of 2.39 mg/dl, and urinary beta-2 microglobulin level of 21,398 μg/l. Urine microscopy revealed numerous white blood cells (100–999 cells/high-power field) along with white blood cell casts. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Other laboratory findings are summarized in Table . Computed tomography (CT) revealed no possible focus of infection. A kidney biopsy was performed to clarify the cause of the acute kidney injury (AKI). The biopsied specimen contained 17 glomeruli. Two of the glomeruli were globally sclerosed but the remaining 15 showed no apparent mesangial proliferation, hypercellularity, or crescent formation. The infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells was conspicuous in the interstitial space and it was accompanied by mild edema and fibrosis. Tubulitis was frequently observed with mild to moderate tubular atrophy in the cortical area, but granuloma formation was not noted. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated no significant immune deposits in the glomeruli or tubules. Inflammatory cells were predominantly composed of CD4-positive cells (Fig. ). A diagnosis of ATIN was made. As anti-PD-1 therapy could disrupt the immune tolerance to medications that had been safely used for a long time by enhancing T-lymphocyte activation, we reassessed the patient’s current medications. PPIs have been recently recognized as important offending drugs in the development of drug-induced ATIN, so lansoprazole was discontinued. His creatinine level showed rapid improvement in 3 days (decreasing from 2.74 to 1.82 mg/dl), and the sterile pyuria disappeared. The patient then received steroid therapy (500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone), and his creatinine levels eventually stabilized around 1.7 mg/dl. DLST for lansoprazole was positive. The detailed methodology for the DLST has been described in a prior publication []. The patient’s clinical course is shown in Fig. . Since the size of the lung cancer and serum carcinoembryonic antigen level remained unchanged, the patient was followed up carefully without re-initiating nivolumab. Urinary beta-2 microglobulin level remained within normal range.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [67, 'years'], 'weight': [49.9, 'kg'], 'height': [168.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [2.39, 'mg/dL']}",21.169,20.111,22.227,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 67 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 2.39 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 49.9 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 49.9 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 17.68 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 17.7, indicating they are underweight.
Because the patient is underweight, we take the patient's weight, 49.9 kg as the patient's adjusted weight needed for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. 
Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 67) * 49.9 * 1) / (2.39 * 72) = 21.169 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 21.169 mL/min."

Also, the patient complains of nausea and vomiting, fever and chills and loss of appetite without symptoms of urinary problems. He had habit of smoking but nothing about previous diseases and taking medications in his history. No history of trauma was mentioned. Physical examination revealed an ill man with following vital signs: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and temperature 39.5°C, pulse rate 100 beats per minute. Tenderness was appreciated in right lower quadrant (RLQ), right inguinal region and scrotum with radiating to the right groin area. Abdomen was soft, symmetric and no signs of distention, guarding, with positive rebound tenderness and Rovsing’s sign. Significant laboratory results included white blood cell count = 16.5 × 103/mic L (normal range 4.4–11.0), hematocrit = 40% (normal range 41.5–50.4), Sodium = 131 mEq/L (normal range 138–145), platelet distribution width = 10.1% (normal range 12.0–20.0) and the other laboratory tests such as: R.B.C Count, Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platelet, Lymphocytes count, Fasting Blood sugar, BUN, creatinine and urine analysis (U/A) were normal. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography revealed features in enlarged lymph node and free abdominal fluid in RLQ. Any significant inflammation, abscess and mass in appendix were not reported. Also, the radiologist recommended consideration of other clinical and paraclinical signs and symptoms to rule out appendicitis. In according to the order of urologist sonographic color-Doppler requested and no significant abnormal findings were reported.

The patient's temperature is 39.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 100.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 16500.0 count/µL. To convert 16500.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 16500.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 16500000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3."
4620,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-5417264-3,Extracted,"The last patient was a 4-year-old female. Following an uncomplicated pregnancy with no ultrasound abnormalities or polyhydramnios, she was born to a G1P1 mother and nonconsanguineous parents. The patient’s mother had had a history of renal stones and recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to a vesicoureteral reflux. The maternal great uncle had received a renal transplant in his mid-40s, though the reason for the transplant was unknown. There was no other family history of renal disease or hearing loss. The child had a long-standing history of dysmorphic features and spastic dystonic diplegia. Her symptoms were consistent with those found on the Galloway-Mowat syndrome spectrum and included microcephaly, cerebellar atrophy, developmental delay and seizures, and proteinuria, with an absence of infantile nephrotic syndrome. Her dysmorphic features included prominent large ears, frontal bossing, a broad nasal bridge, a high arch palate, and scarce eyebrows. In the past, she had exhibited failure to thrive and developmental delay that had progressed since the age of 8 months. She was followed by the genetics clinic because of her developmental delay and her dysmorphic features, which could not be linked to a particular diagnosis or syndrome. She had no previous episodes of dehydration, polyuria, or polydipsia.
She initially presented with status epilepticus and hypomagnesemia at the age of 4. Her anthropomorphic parameters were within normal limits: weight (10.0 kg—below the 3rd percentile), height (94 cm—between the 3rd and 10th percentiles), and head circumference (44.5 cm—below the 3rd percentile). She was placed on valproic acid following her first seizure and experienced significant side effects including lethargy and severe drooling.
She had 2 subsequent hypomagnesemia-associated episodes of status epilepticus; her most recent episode had been complicated by an extended spectrum β-lactamase Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. Her lowest magnesium level was 0.31 mmol/L [reference interval 0.65-1.05] (0.75 mg/dL) and her calcium level was normal at 2.31 mmol/L [reference interval 2.15-2.55] (9.24 mg/dL). Her fractional excretion of magnesium was elevated at 26%. There was no evidence of hypercalciuria (calcium to creatinine ratio 0.35 [reference interval < 0.6] mmol/mmol). Aside from transiently low serum potassium, her serum bicarbonate level, urate level, and fractional potassium excretion were normal. Exome sequencing was performed to verify the CNNM2 mutation differential diagnosis, which is associated with hypomagnesemia and impaired brain development. This test was negative and there was no association with any other known magnesium-losing tubulopathies. No abnormalities were noted in the WDR73 gene, which is associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome. A head MRI revealed diffuse cerebral white matter signal abnormalities evocative of demyelination along with progressive atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres. The numerous EEGs that were performed while she took her maintenance antiepileptics showed that her epileptic activity ceased when her magnesium levels normalized. Her EEG had a background of δ grade II generalized activity, with suppression of grade I activity in the right hemisphere.
The patient’s seizures were difficult to control, requiring phenytoin (15 mg/kg loading dose) and intubation with a midazolam infusion during her episodes of status epilepticus. Her serum magnesium levels normalized after several days of magnesium sulfate infusions (14 mg/kg/h), after which she was switched to oral magnesium oxide (120 mg/kg/d). The addition of amiloride was necessary to maintain stable magnesium levels, and following another episode of status epilepticus, some of the magnesium oxide was replaced with magnesium bisglycinate to reduce diarrhea. If her magnesium levels fall below 0.65 mmol/L, she usually experiences seizures. She is also on enalapril to control her hypertension and proteinuria, which are commonly seen in Galloway-Mowat syndrome.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [10.0, 'kg']}",40.0,38.0,42.0,"The patient's weight is 10.0 kg.

He also reported several episodes of vomiting but no particular aggravating or relieving factors. He was an ex-smoker of three years standing and admitted moderate alcohol consumption (25 U/week). His weight was 115 kg while his height was 195 cm (BMI = 30.2 kg/m2). Both his father and mother had suffered myocardial infarcts at an early age (respectively at 40 and 50 years of age). Hematological and biochemical profiling revealed a mild neutrophilia but normal amylase and troponin levels. A computerized tomogram of his abdomen demonstrated hypoperfusion of the right side of his liver (see Figure ) with cavernous replacement of the portal vein (consistent with thrombotic occlusion of this vessel, see Figure ) and varices around the gallbladder (see Figure ). In addition the scan showed a thickened loop of ileum suggestive of incipient venous gangrene secondary to concomitant thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein (see Figure ). An MRI was also performed to further visualize these findings (see Figure ) and to investigate the patency of the superior mesenteric vein (occluded also). The patient was immediately commenced on full therapeutic anticoagulation (intravenous unfractionated heparin) and was closely observed for signs of peritonitis. He gradually made a full recovery over the next five days. Although his thrombotic screen failed to determine the presence of any specific, inherent procoagulant tendency, he was empirically commenced on oral coumarin treatment. He remains well on follow-up after a period of six months.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [115.0, 'kg'], 'height': [195.0, 'cm']}",99.146,94.189,104.103,"The patient's gender is Male.

He had a history of constipation for 2 days, but no vomiting. The patient was brought after an episode of seizure for 3 min, followed by a brief period of altered sensorium. He was diagnosed with a seizure disorder 9 years ago for which he was on irregular medications. He is a chronic alcoholic for the past 25 years and had an episode of alcohol binge drink 2 days ago. On examination (height – 168 cm; weight – 45 kg), the patient was drowsy with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of E3V4M6-13/15. His blood pressure was 80/48 mm of Hg. His heart rate was 102/min; the respiratory rate was 22 per minute and the temperature was 99°F. Abdomen examination revealed mild abdomen distension, diffuse tenderness with neither guarding nor rigidity, and absent bowel sounds. Digital rectal examination showed altered dark-colored stools. Respiratory system examination showed the presence of equal air entry bilaterally with basal crepitations.
The capillary blood glucose (CBG) at admission was 32 mg/dl. After initial stabilization with intravenous fluids, 25% dextrose, and supportive measures, further investigations were done. A complete blood count showed an elevated total count of 15.4 × 109/L with a neutrophil predominance. X-ray abdomen showed multiple air–fluid levels. CT of the abdomen showed diffuse dilatation of the jejunal and ileal loops and the collapse of the large bowel with a transition point probably at the terminal ileum or ileocecal junction. All these features suggested a small bowel obstruction and the patient was planned for an emergency laparotomy as per the hospital protocol in emergencies. The patient responded well to the initial resuscitation with intravenous fluids, 25% dextrose, and inotropes, and his GCS improved to 15/15 and CBG increased to 180 mg/dl. The patient did not develop any further seizures.
During the emergency laparotomy, the following were found: (1) dilated jejunal and ileal loops, (2) collapsed large bowel, and (3) at 20 cm from the ileocecal junction, there was an ileoileal intussusception []. The involved ileal segment was resected and stomas were fashioned. On examining the specimen, it was found that 7 cm of proximal ileum had telescoped into the distal part and that the telescoped part was gangrenous.
Postoperatively, the patient had a cough with expectoration and he revealed that he had similar episodes for the past 1 month. A chest X-ray which was done preoperatively showed opacity in the left middle zone. Subsequently, the CT chest which was performed showed evidence of consolidation with air bronchogram in the left lower lobe and evidence of cavity with surrounding consolidation in the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe, suggesting an active infection in the lung []. Sputum smears examined with Ziehl–Neelsen stain did not reveal any acid-fast bacilli, but molecular testing by nucleic acid amplification (GeneXpert) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis with moderate sensitivity to rifampicin. The histopathological examination of the resected bowel segment confirmed the presence of numerous epithelial granulomas with aggregations of epithelioid histiocytes and scattered Langhans type of giant cells, suggesting a tuberculous origin of the lesions [Figures and ]. Subsequently, the patient was started on antitubercular treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol according to the local national guidelines. This leads to the conclusion that the small bowel obstruction was due to intussusception and the lead point for the intussusception would have been the tuberculous lesion.

She had an episode of acute gastroenteritis 2 weeks beforepresentation, which was treated by a general practitioner. Subsequently, the patient developed fatigability, syncope, and breathlessness on exertion. At presentation, the patient was pale, cold, and clammy; her pulse rate was 110 beats/min, regular, low volume, and her blood pressure was 92/66 mmHg. On chest auscultation, bibasilar fine crepitations were present; cardiac examination revealed left third heart sound/S3 gallop, but no murmurs. She was kept propped up, given high flow oxygen, and intravenous (IV) furosemide, digoxin, and low dose of dopamine infusion. Her electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and generalized nonspecific ST-T changes, and chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly with features of pulmonary edema. Her routine investigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dl). The rest of the biochemical investigations including liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The echocardiogram revealed mitral regurgitation with normal cusps, and severe left-ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, with an LV ejection fraction of 25%. A diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy with LV failure was made, and the patient was treated for the same. Despite the resolution of pulmonary edema, she continued to have systolic blood pressure recordings of 90 mmHg with associated fatigue and light-headedness. Her general condition including apathy, anorexia, and nausea, did not improve. She was also noted to have psychomotor slowing, and hoarseness of voice.

She also recalled having multiple episodes of vomiting, and headache during the episode, and being given large quantities of IV fluids and two-three units of whole blood. The patient had recovered completely following the PPH. Her neuro-imaging during the episode was found to be normal. Since then, the patient developed episodes of syncope, craving for salt and water, and cold intolerance. She continued to have a normal reproductive function, and had two pregnancies over the next 5 years, with uncomplicated delivery in hospital. She, however, had lactation failure in both the pregnancies. She continues to have normal menstrual cycles till date, 9 years after her last pregnancy. She had normal axillary and pubic hair.

With an anxious expression on her face, physical examination revealed that she was 150 cm tall and body weight 30.1 kg with vital signs of body temperature 37.1°C, blood pressure 94/65 mmHg, heart rate 70 b.p.m. with ECG features of normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, and transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation 94%. White blood cell count (WBC) was 12 490 count/μL on admission and increased to 17 580 count/μL on 29 November. C-reactive protein also drastically increased from 1.31 mg/dL on admission to 2.20 mg/dL on 29 November. On admission, brimonidine tartrate drop was administered. After admission, she developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with anaemia and thrombocytopenia. MDS is a heterogeneous disorder related to haematopoietic abnormalities that are frequently found in elderly people. As ingestion intake was difficult, nutritional support via a central venous hyperalimentation route was adopted. She developed suspected sepsis and was treated with ampicillin sodium (3000 mg/day) on 22 November, with meropenem hydrate (500 mg/day) from 29 November, with ceftazidime hydrate (1000 mg/day) and gentamicin sulphate (80 mg/day) from 7 December, with ampicillin sodium (1500 mg/day) from 30 December, and with meropenem hydrate (250 mg/day) from 11 January 2017.
From 5 January to 7 January, ANMS monitoring showed a marked linear decrease in the LF and HF of HRV components. Furthermore, from 7 January to 12 January, both the LF and HF showed low and linear values (). On 7 January, at 2:00 p.m., the ANMS automatically registered the CSR pathogenesis () around the intersection of two lines, that is, the decreasing LF line (from 5 January to 7 January) and the constant LF line (from 7 January to 12 January). The intersection of the LF lines overlapped with the intersection of the decreasing HF line (from 5 January to 7 January) and the constant HF line (from 7 January to 12 January). Our patient died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 20 days after the registration of daytime CSR pathogenesis.

6320,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-6240427-1,Extracted,"A 67-year-old Japanese man with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and angina presented with a history of generalized weakness, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight loss, and loss of appetite. The patient was a smoker who had been smoking a half-pack per day for 47 years. His family history was unremarkable.
One and one-half months prior to admission, the patient had symptoms of lethargy and anorexia, with a 7-kg weight loss in only 1 month. On the admission day, he could not move because of overall weakness and lethargy and was transferred to our hospital. He was conscious and oriented, and his blood pressure was low (104/70 mmHg) compared with his previous hypertension. His blood glucose on arrival was low (64 mg/dl). His body temperature was 35.8 °C, heart rate (HR) was 60 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min. No conjunctival pallor or thyromegaly was appreciated. Cardiac and pulmonary examination results were normal, other than a positive tilt test. His neurological examination revealed that his higher cognitive functions were normal, as were the cranial pairs, with no visual defect.
Laboratory studies revealed that the patient’s complete blood count and coagulation were normal. Biochemistry tests revealed a sodium level of 134 mEq/L (reference range, 135–147) and hypoglycemia, but the other electrolytes were within normal limits. Notably, the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.505 μIU/ml (reference range, 0.38–4.31), that of free thyroxine (FT4) was 0.61 ng/dl (reference range, 0.82–1.63), and that of free triiodothyronine was 1.67 ng/dl (reference range, 2.17–3.34) (see Table ). An electrocardiogram showed a sinus bradycardiac rhythm (HR, 53 beats/min) with no conduction or repolarization abnormalities. The echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. We suspected hypopituitarism based on the patient’s hypoglycemia, hypotension, nonelevated TSH, and low FT4, and also based on the results of head computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
CT of the head demonstrated a high-density area in the pituitary-hypothalamic axis, which suggested a hemorrhagic lesion (Fig. ). Subsequently, MRI of the brain was performed, revealing multiple masses (Fig. a, b) and a 10-mm mass on the recessus infundibulum in T2 star-weighted sequences, which were also consistent with hemorrhagic masses (Fig. c, d). In addition, a chest x-ray revealed a left hilar mass (Fig. ). We also noted a suspicious shadow in the left lung hilum shown in the chest radiograph. Subsequently, CT of the thorax revealed a mass in the left hilum (Fig. ), which was confirmed on biopsy by bronchoscopy later. There were no emphysematous changes on the chest CT scan, but some mediastinal lymphadenopathies were detected.
After the patient’s admission, we first performed a hormone loading test on day 4. The results of the hormone profile at baseline were as follows: TSH 0.586 μIU/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.7 mIU/ml (reference range, 2–8.3), luteinizing hormone (LH) < 0.1 mIU/ml (reference range, 1.2–7.1), prolactin 37.9 ng/ml (reference range, 3.6–12.8), testosterone < 4.3 ng/dl (reference range, 142.4–923.1), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 5.6 pg/ml (reference range, 7.2–63.3), and cortisol 0.2 μg/dl (reference range, 4.5–21.1). The results showed a TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone: serum TSH 4.526 μIU/ml at 30 min and 4.591 μIU/ml at 60 min. We demonstrated an adequate cortisol and ACTH response to corticotropin-releasing hormone: serum cortisol was 5.6 μg/ dl at 60 min and had a peak of 5.7 μg/ dl at 90 min, whereas serum ACTH showed a peak of 106.3 pg/ml at 30 min, 84.0 pg/ml at 60 min, and 62.4 pg/ml at 90 min. It also showed a delayed LH and FSH response to LH-releasing hormone: serum LH showed a value of 0.8 mIU/ml at 30 min, 1.1 mIU/ml at 60 min, and peak of 1.3 mIU/ml at 90 min, whereas serum FSH was 1.5 mIU/ml at 30 min, 1.8 mIU/ml at 60 min, and peak of 2.1 mIU/ml at 90 min (Fig. a). Those results suggested hypothalamic pan-hypopituitarism.
Tumor markers demonstrated elevated pro-gastrin-releasing peptide with a value of 678 pg/ml (reference range, 0–80.0) and neuron-specific enolase 18.6 ng/ml (reference range, 0–12), which are typical markers for small cell lung cancer. We performed lung biopsy by bronchoscopy. Endobronchial ultrasound of bronchoscopy was used, and transbronchial lung biopsies were performed. The pathological results eventually revealed a small cell lung cancer (Fig. ).
We made a diagnosis of pan-hypopituitarism secondary to suprasellar metastases from a small cell lung cancer and first initiated hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and levothyroxine. Right after the replacement therapy, the symptoms of lethargy, loss of appetite, and hypotension were improved. There was no evidence of diabetes insipidus during those therapies. The patient’s clinical stage was stage IV (cT3N2M1b), and his performance status was 0 to 1; thus, he was treated with adjuvant cranial radiotherapy on day 24 and chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide on day 45. We reevaluated the hormone loading test on day 59 after admission, which revealed an improvement in ACTH and cortisol secretions (Fig. ). We also performed a brain MRI in T2 star-weighted sequences again on day 62, which demonstrated disappearance of the suprasellar tumor (Fig. e, f). The patient was subsequently treated with four cycles of chemotherapy, but he died 10 months later due to the progression of the lung cancer. An autopsy was not performed, because the patient’s family denied permission.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 67 years old. The patient's is a Male.
The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly male's, the total body water percentage value is 0.50.
The patient's weight is 7.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mEq. To convert from 134.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 134.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 134.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 134.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 134.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 7.0 * (134.0/140 - 1) = -0.15 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.15 L."

The preoperative CT examination revealed a displaced right upper lobe bronchus, approximately 1 cm above the carina (). Left-sided OLV, using a 37 F DLT, instead of a blocker, was planned. After anesthetic induction, a left-sided DLT was placed. A fiberoptic bronchoscope was then passed down the tube and confirmed the presence of a RUL bronchus, located in an aforementioned site ().

4834,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8362796-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) presented to the ICU with a 10-day onset of dyspnea and a dry cough. He was a former cigarette smoker with a 10-year history of 15 packs per day but had stopped for the past two years. He stood 180.3 cm tall and weighed 151.5 kg for a body mass index (BMI) of 46.6. EMS reported the patient’s O2 saturation at 57% room air and immediately placed him on BiPap for supplemental oxygen therapy upon arrival. The patient reported his shortness of breath had worsened in the last 24 hours. Aggravating factors included exertion and an attempt to speak. A positive PCR test confirmed the patient’s diagnosis for COVID-19 on April 10, 2021, approximately eight days after he was exposed by a co-worker on April 2, 2021 (Table ). These sequences of events occurred following his administration of the J&J vaccine on March 31, 2021 (Table ). His review of systems was remarkable for exacerbating chest pain and a dry cough with a worsened shortness of breath. He had a family history significant for hypertension. He denies any tobacco, alcohol, or drug abuse. He had no known drug allergies (NKDA). His regularly prescribed medications included Atorvastatin, Metoprolol, and Pantoprazole.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained en route reported regular rhythm with sinus tachycardia with no signs of ectopy. The PR, QRS, and T-waves were normal with no changes to his ST-wave. On arrival, he displayed severe respiratory deterioration with dyspnea and hyperventilation with measured pulse oximetry of room air at 67%. Cardiac defibrillation was successfully performed by endotracheal tube (ET) intubation; 40 mg of propofol, 4 mg versed, and 50 mg of rocuronium were administered to sedate the patient.
Physical examination was notable for a heart rate of 136 beats per minute, a respiration rate of 40 breaths per minute, and hypertension (174 mmHg/104 mmHg). The cardiovascular examination was significant for rhythm sinus tachycardia with S1 and S2 heart tones present. For his pulmonary examination, he required mechanical ventilation at a rate of 15 liters per minute, 100% BiPap, and 5 cmH2O for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Bilateral crackle sounds were heard, along with an observed asymmetrical chest mount and intercostal retractions. The use of his accessory muscles was noted.
Given the report of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis with severe dyspnea and hyperventilation, there was high suspicion for SARS-associated pneumonia as the cause for his ARDS. He received an RNA nose swab and was started on a combination of Remdesivir, Rocephin, Zithromax, and Decadron (6 mg IV q 12 hours). Vaportherm was provided for additional oxygenation along with normal saline 150 cc/hour for sepsis. He was emergently taken to radiology for suspected pulmonary masses. Chest X-rays revealed bilateral airspace consolidations with no acute osseous abnormalities to confirm lateral airspace disease (Figure ). These consolidations would likely be a result of an infection/inflammation due to sepsis or viral pneumonia. The catheterization lab revealed an elevated filling pressure on the right side of his heart with a right atrial pressure of 21 mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 14 mmHg. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed a thrombus crossing the bifurcation that extended into the right upper, middle, and lower lobe segmental branches with a greater thrombus burden on the left pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle (Figure ). Minimal atheromatous plaques were found with no dissection or thoracic aortic aneurysm. Bilateral ground-glass consolidations with interstitial thickening were discovered in the lungs with an increased right to left heart ratio suggesting an underlying right heart strain to a certain degree. Upper and lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds showed occlusive and non-occlusive thrombus bilaterally on the patient’s lower extremity veins (Figure ).
Laboratory analysis displayed in Table was conducted upon the patient’s arrival. It showed increased concentrations of glucose (164 mg/dL), alanine (82 U/liter), and aspartate aminotransferase (43 U/liter) with a low platelet count of 100,000 μL. Low levels of fibrinogen at 132 mg/dl were measured. Elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial-thromboplastin (PTT) were measured at 16.4 and 37 seconds, respectively. Elevated acidity levels were observed for the patient with increased lactic acid levels from 9.0 mmol/L to 10.3 mmol/L (Table ) and a decreased pH from 7.455 to 7.255 (Table ). The patient’s arterial blood gas values in Table revealed a low partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 58.3 mmHg and increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 40.2 mmHg. These blood gas values put the patient at a higher risk for respiratory failure with a decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 58.3 mmHg/100%. This ratio meets the threshold feature for increased severity of ARDS []. Severe hypoxia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 250 is associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) []. He had an abnormally elevated D-dimer level at 3.6 μg/mL (Table ).
The patient continued hyperventilating with a decline in oxygen saturation from 90% to 76.1% (Table ). He was deemed critical but in stable condition within the capability of the ICU. The attending physician explained to the patient and his family the status of his continued respiratory failure by the findings of the DVT and PE. The patient was transferred upon recommendations made by his attending physician and the intensivist to a nearby healthcare facility for higher-level (tertiary) care for further management. He underwent radiological intervention two days later to remove the clots from his lungs. The patient, unfortunately, continued to experience worsened dyspnea with no significant improvement, which resulted in his expiration approximately one month following his initial admission.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [151.5, 'kg']}",191.5,181.925,201.075,"The patient's weight is 151.5 kg.

Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (151.5 kg - 20 kg) = 191.5 mL/hr.
Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 191.5 mL/hr."

She also suffered from alopecia and persistent/recurring respiratory infections. Both parents were reported to be healthy and they were consanguineous (first cousins). Their four children except for our patient were healthy.
Physical examination of the patient revealed normal vital signs. The percentiles of her weight and height were between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. She had pale skin, total alopecia and pitting in the nails of her hands and feet (). A crackling sound was heard during inspiration. Her puberty was stage I according to Tanner stages.
Her hematology results revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, hematocrit 19.9%, white blood cells 13200/mm3, platelets 35000/mm3, MCV 84fL and reticulocytes of 8.14%, as well as negative direct Coombs test result. Blood smear showed schistocytes (). Her biochemical investigation revealed: urea 142 mg/dL, creatinine 4.61 mg/dL, AST 97 U/L, ALT 79 U/L, LDH 2218 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.55 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 5.9 mmol/L, chloride 109 mmol/L, calcium 8.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.0 mg/dL, uric acid 8.0 mg/dL, ph 7.44, HCO3- 21 mmol/L and glucose 76 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed the following: pH 7.5, density 1010, protein (++), erythrocytes (+++), leucocytes (-) and dysmorphic erythrocytes in the urinary sediment.
Based on these biochemical and urinary abnormalities, the patient was diagnosed as HUS. After seven plasma exchange sessions, the hemolysis finally stopped and the laboratory abnormalities and renal function reverted to normal. The respiratory infection was treated with appropriate antibiotic regimens.
In the hormonal evaluation, free thyroxine (fT4) was 1.11 ng/dL (0.8-2.2), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.028 mU/mL (0.6-5.5), anti-peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody 62 IU/ mL (<20), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibody 65 IU/mL (<4.0), cortisol 25.5 mg/dL (3-21), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 28.1 pg/mL (10-60), estradiol 14 ng/dL (0.2.0), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.32 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.07 mIU/mL (0.02-0.3), anti-pancreatic islets antibody 1/100 (<1/10), parathyroid hormone (PTH) 65.9 ng/mL (10-65), renin 72 ng/L (5-35), aldosterone 248 pg/mL (20-300), vitamin B12 456 pg/mL (150-883) and folic acid 4.2 ng/mL (3.1-20.5) before plasma exchange therapy. Although thyroid ultrasonography was normal and the patient was not on Na-L-T4 treatment, both anti-TPO antibody and anti-TG antibody tests were positive. These findings suggested early diagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis. Cortisol response to ACTH stimulation test (1 μg ACTH) was as follows: initial 1 mg/dL, 30th minute 8.1 mg/dL, 60th minute 11.2 mcg/dL, 90th minute 14.1 mg/dL, and 120th 14.7 mg/dL. The cut-off level of this test was 14 mg/dL (9). These results were interpreted as a normal response to ACTH stimulation test and indicated that there was no adrenal insufficiency. In immunological evaluation, IgA was 24 mg/dL (29-384), IgM 24 mg/dL (50-278), IgG 464 mg/dL (625-1579), IgE 464 IU/mL (0-170), C3 90 mg/dL (90-180), C4 26 mg/dL (10-40), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (-), anti-double strain DNA antibody (-), p-ANCA (-), c-ANCA (-) and anti-HBs (-) before plasma exchange therapy. Lymphocyte subsets were CD3 78% (55-78), CD19 2% (10-31), CD4 39% (27-53) and CD8 51% (19-34). The complement factor H gene region was proliferated by PCR method. Sequences which have single nucleotide polymorphism on complement factor H have been determined. CT homozygote polymorphism for His402Tyr was detected. This factor is considered to be a risk factor for development of HUS ().

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 109.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 109.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 109.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 109.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 109.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 109.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (109.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 4.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 4.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 4.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 4.0 - 12 = -8.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -8.0 mEq/L."

A 27-year-old male presented to a community emergency department in summer of 2016 in western Washington State complaining of lightheadedness and ""almost passing out."" The patient reported that he had been feeling generally fatigued over the past 48 hours. He was normally very active, hiking and rock climbing frequently, however he felt as though he had not been able to hike at his normal brisk pace. The day before his presentation, while finishing a long hike, he had become lightheaded and nearly lost consciousness, stating that he rapidly lowered himself to the ground. His girlfriend, who accompanied him, confirms that he did not fully lose consciousness. The patient cannot recall any preceding symptoms; he specifically denies having chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, or any focal neurological deficits. Several seconds after the episode, the patient felt completely back to his recent baseline. He had no persistent lightheadedness.
Upon returning from the hike that day, the patient visited a local urgent care. He had no symptoms at the time and was noted to have dry mucus membranes on physical exam. His work-up there included complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and electrocardiogram, which were normal. The patient was diagnosed with dehydration and presyncope and was discharged to home.
At home, the patient rehydrated orally and went to bed. He awoke at 02:00 with recurrent symptoms so he drove to the emergency department.
Upon arrival, the patient was placed on a monitor in the triage room and was noted by the triage nurse to be in complete atrioventricular dissociation. During triage, the patient briefly lost consciousness, during which time the triage nurse noted an eight-second ventricular pause on the cardiac monitor. External pacer/defibrillator pads were placed and the patient was brought back to a trauma room. On initial physician interview, the patient noted continued lightheadedness but denied chest pain, palpitations, jaw or arm pain, nausea, edema, or shortness of breath. He also denied headache, focal weakness, and speech or coordination changes. He reported no fever or respiratory symptoms in the past week.
The patient had no past medical or surgical history. He received all routine pediatric vaccinations and screening studies. He was not prescribed any medications and denied using any supplements or alternative medical treatments. He had no known drug allergies. He had a family history of hypertension in his mother and coronary artery disease in his father, diagnosed in his 60s. There was also a family history of colorectal cancer in his father. He denied any known family history of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrhythmias, although he admitted to not being well informed about his family history. The patient was a non-smoker, drank one to two alcoholic drinks per week, and denied recreational or intravenous drug use.
During the travel history, the patient did report having traveled extensively throughout the United States over the past year to participate in outdoor recreational activities. He recalled camping in the Northeast region two months ago, after which he had some low grade fever and a red rash on his right shoulder. He described the rash as circular and gradually enlarging. He did not recall any central clearing. The fever and rash spontaneously resolved and he did not seek medical attention for these. He had no further symptoms after that, up until 48 hours prior to his presentation to the emergency department.
A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative. Vital signs were blood pressure: 112/65; heart rate: 62; respiratory rate: 12; temperature: 98.5.
Physical exam revealed a fit-appearing young male who was mildly diaphoretic but was alert and fully oriented and in no acute medical distress. Cardiac exam demonstrated a borderline bradycardic rate. There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no extremity edema and peripheral pulses were symmetric. There was no jugular venous distention. Breath sounds were clear to auscultation and symmetric. His abdomen was soft and non-tender. The remainder of the physical examination was without noted abnormalities. Notably, there was no rash, focal weakness, or joint tenderness or effusion. He had a normal neurologic exam.
An electrocardiogram was obtained rapidly after the patient’s admission to the emergency department. This showed atrioventricular (AV) dissociation with accelerated junctional rhythm. Axis was normal. There were no acute ST elevation or depression and no T wave abnormalities. See Figure for the ECG.
Complete blood count in the emergency department showed a white blood cell count of 8,500 per microliter (reference range 3,800-11,000 per microliter), hematocrit of 41.2% (reference range 39-50%), and a platelet count of 248,000 per microliter (150,000-400,000 per microliter). White blood cell differential was within the hospital laboratory’s established normal limits.
A comprehensive metabolic panel revealed a glucose of 97 mg/dL (reference range 65-99 mg/dL), creatinine of 0.80 mg/dL (reference range 0.7-1.30 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 15 mg/dL (reference range 7-18 mg/dL), sodium of 140 mmol/L (reference range 136-145 mmol/L), and potassium of 3.6 mmol/L (reference range 3.5-5.1). Transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were within normal laboratory reference ranges.
Urine toxicology screen was negative for any drugs of abuse.
A point-of-care troponin was not elevated outside of the reference range. A repeat troponin was checked 4.5 hours later and was also within normal limits.
Subsequent serial ECGs demonstrated periods of junctional rhythm slower than atrial rhythm, confirming third-degree heart block.
Intervention
The patient was given a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and was admitted to a cardiac telemetry floor. A transvenous pacemaker was placed. Blood was sent for serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. He was started on empiric therapy with 2 grams of IV ceftriaxone given once daily on the presumption of Lyme carditis as well as maintenance IV normal saline.
Serial laboratory evaluation each morning consisted of a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. These laboratory studies did not fall significantly outside of reference ranges throughout the course of the patient’s hospitalization. Serial electrogardiograms were obtained and showed persistent complete atrioventricular block in the first three days of his hospitalization. Additional diagnostic studies that were ordered during the patient’s hospital stay included an echocardiogram, which revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness, normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55-60% (reference range 55-60%), and no significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis. There was no evidence of diastolic dysfunction to suggest infiltrative cardiomyopathy. There was no pericardial effusion. A thyroid stimulating hormone level was checked and was 1.210 microIU/mL (reference range 0.358- 3.740 microIU/mL).
Outcomes
The patient’s enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and subsequent Western blot serology testing returned positive for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, suggesting active infection. He remained in the hospital for 10 days during which time his cardiac telemetry monitoring showed gradually lengthening intervals of Mobitz I second-degree heart block. Following seven days of treatment, there were no further intervals of third-degree heart block. Upon discharge from the hospital, pacemaker wire was removed. The patient followed up with a family medicine physician one week following his discharge. ECG done at that time showed normal sinus rhythm.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [15.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [97.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [140.0, 'mmol/L']}",290.746,276.209,305.283,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. 
The concentration of bun is 15.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 97.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 140.0 + (15.0 / 2.8) + (15.0 / 18) = 290.746 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 290.746 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 290.746 mOsm/kg."

He was a nonsmoker, did not endorse regular alcohol use, and denied any illicit drug use. His family history was noncontributory. His vitals at presentation were temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 80 beats per minute, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen Saturation 93% on room air. Home medications included bumetanide 1 mg daily, metolazone 1.25 mg twice a week, carvedilol 12.5 mg daily, and dabigatran 75 mg twice a day. Complete blood count (CBC) was unremarkable, and basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed creatinine of 2.2 mg/dl (near baseline). NT-pro-BNP was elevated at 18,500 pg/ml (baseline 2000s). Troponin was elevated at 0.36 ng/ml.
Urology was consulted, and patient underwent cystoscopic evaluation for hematuria. Clot evacuation and fulguration of diffuse bladder lesions were performed. Bladder biopsy was also obtained, and subepithelial amyloid deposits were identified based on Congo-red stain.
In the following days, the patient developed intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, hypotension, liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) peaked at 3000 (U/L) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) at 2000 (U/L). Remaining liver function tests showed alkaline phosphatase 50 (U/L), bilirubin 3-4 mg/dl, hyperammonemia (72 mcmol/L) and elevated international normalized ration (INR) around 4. Computed tomography imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for any acute process but showed cardiomegaly that was seen in the plain chest radiography as well. Workup for any acute infectious or inflammatory processes (viral markers, acetaminophen levels, and autoimmune markers) for evaluation of acute liver dysfunction did not reveal any alternate diagnosis, thereby suggesting acute decompensation from shock liver.
Echocardiogram demonstrated worsening of ejection fraction (EF) to 10–15% with concentric left ventricle hypertrophy, impaired left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, thickened interventricular septum more than 12 mm, normal biventricular dimensions, biatrial dilation with no significant valvular abnormalities (findings compatible with cardiac amyloidosis) (). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was not performed due to underlying CKD. His condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to the cardiac care unit for acute decompensated heart failure. He was started on milrinone infusion with transient improvement in his cardiac function and end organ perfusion.
He was evaluated for cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrade but deemed unstable from medical standpoint to undergo the procedure.
Hematology team was consulted and performed biochemical workup for amyloidosis. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) did not show an M-spike. Serum-free light analysis (kappa/lambda ratio 2.9) and urine immunofixation studies were not significant ruling out evidence for plasma cell dyscrasias. Meanwhile, the mass spectrometry analysis of the bladder biopsy specimen confirmed wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) consistent with senile systemic amyloidosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was not performed as mass spectrometry has been demonstrated to be a well-validated technique to diagnose and classify amyloidosis [, ]. Genetic testing can help clarify if the disease was hereditary or not but was not performed in this case and remains a limitation.
Multiple specialties including internal medicine, hematology, cardiology, and critical care were involved in the patient care, but despite aggressive management, patient's condition gradually deteriorated. Due to the poor prognosis in the setting of multiple comorbidities and decompensated heart failure, the patients' family decided to stop further treatment and focus on patients comfort only which was facilitated by the palliative care team. The patient passed away shortly thereafter from cardiac arrest, and the diagnosis was acute on chronic cardiac failure from senile systemic amyloidosis.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [100.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [70.0, 'mm hg']}",80.0,76.0,84.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

7884,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4237767-1,Extracted,"A 42-year-old man with cholecystolithiasis had an open cholecystectomy under epidural anesthesia at a local hospital 2 months prior to admission. He weighed 72 kg and was 173 cm tall, and had no significant medical history. During the operation his vital signs were stable and no hypotension was observed. The epidural catheter was inserted via the T7–T8 interspace, and passed upward to the upper thoracic levels. During insertion of the catheter he felt a shooting pain over the right lower leg, which disappeared immediately. Five milliliters of 2% lidocaine was injected as a test dose. Five minutes after the test-dose injection, 15 mL of 2% lidocaine (with adrenaline 1:200,000) was given incrementally, obtaining a T4 sensory level. The operation was uneventful. At the end of surgery, the epidural catheter was removed.
On the fifth postoperative day, the patient complained of numbness and a paresis of the right leg, which spread to the left leg. Thereafter he was evaluated by an anesthetist and a neurologist. Neurologic examinations showed that sensory deficit was below the T7 level, muscle power was grade 2/5 over the right lower limb and 4/5 over the left lower limb, deep tendon reflexes of both lower limbs were increased, and the Babinski sign was bilaterally positive. He had bladder incontinence and constipation, and his positional sense of the left leg was impaired. Emergency thoracic computed tomography (CT) ruled out disk herniation, epidural abscess, and epidural hematoma. Both thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and motor-evoked potentials recorded from the lower limbs were normal. Therefore, transverse myelitis was diagnosed and the patient was administered dexamethasone and γ-globulin. Two months after initiation of therapy, the patient had not yet shown any neurologic improvement, and was transferred to our hospital for further treatment.
After admission the patient was re-examined. MRI of the thoracic spine showed a hyperintense lesion expanding the cord from T6 through T7 on T2-weighted images, and on T1-weighted images there was an isointense lesion expanding the cord from T6 through T7 with ring enhancement after gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GDTA) administration (Figure A–C). Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal and the CSF culture did not grow any bacteria. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Chest radiography revealed no abnormality. Therefore, spinal cord infarction (SCI), intramedullary inflamed granuloma, or intramedullary neoplasm was considered to be the cause of paraplegia following epidural anesthesia. The patient was treated with dexamethasone, antiviral medications, and rehabilitation training. These therapies apparently relieved his neurologic symptoms. However, 20 days after administration his sensorimotor functions suddenly deteriorated. Numbness and paresthesia sensation extended up to the T5 levels. Muscle power of the lower limbs decreased to grade 0/5 over the right lower limb and 2/5 over the left lower limb. MRI studies at this time showed an enlargement of the intramedullary lesion (Figure A, B). Because of the patient’s neurologic deterioration and the uncertain diagnosis, complete surgical excision of the intramedullary mass was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a tuberculous granulomatous lesion (Figure ). Antituberculous treatment was initiated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide after surgical intervention and was continued for 6 months. At the last follow-up visit, 7 months after laminectomy, his motor and sensory functions had gradually improved over time. He was able to walk with assistance and had regained bladder control.
Paraplegia is a rare but tragic complication following epidural anesthesia. When postoperative paraplegia occurs, the anesthetic technique, surgical procedure, and coexisting disease should all be considered. In this case, the postoperative paraplegia was related to intramedullary spinal tuberculoma. However, we were unable to ascertain the exact cause of paraplegia before histopathologic examination. From clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, the possible causes of postoperative paraplegia in this patient included acute transverse myelitis, SCI, and intramedullary inflamed granuloma or neoplasm.
Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) represents a major subset of acute noncompressive myelopathies characterized by acute or subacute dysfunctions of motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves [], with an incidence of 1–4 per 1 million persons per year. Individual sporadic cases of transverse myelitis have been reported following spinal, epidural, or general anesthesia, but the causative agent has not been identified []. Because the clinical symptoms and abnormal gadolinium enhancement of the spinal cord at MRI were noted in our patient, the diagnosis of ATM could not be excluded despite normal CSF analysis.
SCI is a rare disorder characterized by flaccid paraplegia with absent deep tendon reflexes, but with preserved proprioception and vibration sense. It has been reported that the causes of SCI following epidural anesthesia include compression of the spinal arteries by the volume of epidural solution, systemic hypotension, pre-existing vascular disease, the local vasoconstrictor effect of epinephrine, and possible acute thrombosis of the anterior spinal or radicular arteries []. In this case, introducing an excessive amount of anesthetics into the epidural space and using epinephrine in the local anesthetic solution were possible contributory risk factors. However, the absence of hypotension during the operation, the loss of positional sense in the patient’s left leg, and the characteristics of signal abnormity on MRI examination do not completely support the diagnosis of SCI.
Intramedullary spinal tuberculoma is a rare form of central nervous system tuberculosis, which occurs usually in young people and in the thoracic spinal cord. Although it frequently presents signs of subacute spinal cord compression, variable clinical manifestations including Brown-Sequard syndrome and episodes of paraplegia have also been reported []. The MRI of intramedullary tuberculomas shows gadolinium ring enhancement, with or without central hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and gadolinium to isointense rings on T1-weighted images []. In our patient there was an isointense area with cord expansion on T1-weighted images and a hyperintense area on T2-weighted images, with ring enhancement after contrast administration. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of intramedullary spinal tuberculoma was delayed despite the typical imaging features, for several possible reasons. First, the patient had no history of tuberculosis. It has been suggested that intramedullary tuberculomas are almost always associated with active pulmonary tuberculosis []. Second, the tuberculin skin test, chest radiography, and CSF examinations were all normal. Lastly, postoperative paraplegia accidently occurred following epidural anesthesia, and the puncture site was adjacent to the lesion location of intramedullary spinal tuberculoma. Therefore, it was necessary to identify anesthesia-related complications.
The optimal treatment of intramedullary tuberculoma remains debatable. Both surgical and medical treatments have been reported to achieve reasonable efficacy in different studies [–]. Medical treatment includes antituberculous chemotherapy and steroid therapy. The addition of corticosteroids with single or multiple tuberculomas resulted in an improved clinical outcome, presumably by reducing edema. For this reason, the neurologic function of our patient was improved temporarily after dexamethasone treatment. Surgery is generally indicated when (1) there is no response to chemotherapy, (2) the diagnosis is in doubt, and (3) there are large lesions with rapid deterioration in neurologic function []. Because of the uncertain diagnosis and deterioration of neurologic status, surgical intervention was performed in our patient. Despite subsequent antituberculous therapy, the patient retained some disability.",What is the patient's body surface area?

Patient history revealed that he was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at the age of eleven, when he underwent surgical intervention for subluxation of the crystalline lens. He never underwent an imagistic assessment of heart and vessels. According to the patient’s statements, he was asymptomatic until two weeks prior to hospital presentation when he developed progressive dyspnea. The patient was admitted to Craiova Cardiology Center for detailed evaluation and management.
Physical examination revealed marfanoid constitutional type, with decreased body weight when compared to height. The anthropometric measurements revealed a height of 205cm, body weight of 58kg, body mass index of 14.5kg/m2 and body surface area of 1.91m2.
Clinical examination of the musculoskeletal system demonstrated thoracic kyphoscoliosis, funnel chest (pectusexcavatum) (Figure . a, b), mandibular retrognathia, dental crowding, limited extension at the elbow, flat foot, and arachnodactyly (Figure . c).
The apex beat was displaced to the mid-axillary line. An intense aortic diastolic murmur and a grade 3/6 apical systolic murmur were also present. Systolic blood pressure varied between 130 and 100mmHg with undetectable diastolic pressure.
Eye examination showed palpebral ptosis and enophtalmia.
Cardiopulmonary radiography was performed and revealed dilated heart, elongated aorta, left basal pachypleuritis and bullous emphysema.
Bidimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed severe dilatation of proximal thoracic aorta. Aortic annulus diameter was measured to be 39 mm (Fig. . a) while aortic root and ascending aorta expressed similar degree of dilatation measuring 82 mm respectively 81 mm (Fig. . b). Descending aorta presented with normal diameter.
The geometric changes of the aorta led to tethering of aortic valve cusps and deficit of coaptation causing severe aortic regurgitation (Fig. . c, d).
Thorough examination of the proximal thoracic aorta revealed an image of intimal flap suggesting aortic dissection. Other findings included severe left ventricle dilatation with diffuse hypokinesia and severe depression of left ventricle ejection fraction, moderate mitral and tricuspid secondary regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Transesophageal echocardiography evaluation was not possible due to patient general condition. Given the sudden onset of the patient's symptoms and the echocardiographic image suggestive for dissection a computerized tomography scan was recommended. The exam confirmed the ascending aortic aneurysm without strong evidence of aortic dissection intimal flap. Descending and abdominal aorta had normal diameters.
The patient was referred to a specialized institution for surgical treatment. He underwent an emergency Bentall procedure (Fig. ) involving replacement of the aortic valve with a mechanical prosthesis, aortic root and ascending aorta, with re-implantation of the coronary arteries into the graft and distal anastomosis at the level of brachiocephalic trunk. Intimal dissection of the ascending aorta was revealed intraoperatively.
Echocardiographic evaluation performed 14 days after surgery found no residual aortic regurgitation; however, mild mitral regurgitation as well as tricuspid regurgitation were still present. Left ventricle ejection fraction also remained severely reduced.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [58.0, 'kg'], 'height': [205.0, 'cm']}",81.779,77.69,85.868,"The patient's gender is Male.

1176,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-8543969-1,Extracted,"A 67-year-old male was admitted for exertional dyspnea and fatigue. He was diagnosed with MM one year earlier. He had received chemotherapy with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone, achieving nearly complete remission without maintenance therapy. Two months earlier, he was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome due to syncope and was implanted with a permanent pacemaker. After this admission, the patient had a body temperature of 36 °C, blood pressure of 119/72 mmHg, pulse rate of 74 beats per min, and respiratory rate of 20 beats per min. Physical examination revealed mild edema on his face and lower extremity. Slightly distended jugular veins were observed. The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a significant and irregularly shaped mass filling the right atrium (RA) (Fig. a) and obstructing the right ventricular inflow tract. The mass also extended into the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC), resulting in almost complete occlusion of the SVC and partial obstruction of the IVC (Fig. b and c). A computed tomography (CT) scan also demonstrated a large mass in the RA extending to the SVC and IVC (Fig. d–f). The large mass surrounded the pacemaker lead (Fig. d). Bilateral pleural effusions were also observed. Angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. The laboratory test showed a white blood cell count of 4.5 × 109/L, hemoglobin level of 127 g/L, platelet count of 119 × 109/L, creatinine level of 108 μmol/L, and alanine aminotransferase level of 57.7 U/L.
Because the patient was in a stable course of MM and the pacemaker led through his SVC and RA, we initially considered the mass to be a right atrial thrombus. The patient underwent right atrial mass resection under cardiopulmonary bypass. Intraoperative findings revealed multiple lobulated masses occupying most of the RA (Fig. a), extending to the SVC and IVC. The mass also infiltrated the free wall of the RA, especially “freezing” the anterolateral wall of the RA. Intraoperative rapid pathological examination of the mass indicated a malignant tumor. The large mass in the RA could not be completely removed due to infiltration of the atrial wall. Therefore, a partial tumor and the anterolateral wall of the RA were resected to relieve the obstruction of the SVC, IVC, and right ventricular inflow tract. Then, the incision of the RA was reconstructed with a pericardial patch. The patient recovered uneventfully after the surgery. One month later, he received one cycle of chemotherapy with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.
Postoperative pathological examination of the right atrial mass suggested malignant plasmacytoma associated with MM. Immunocytochemical staining of the tumor sections indicated atypical immature plasma cells positive for CD138, CD38, CyclinD1, and λ, and negative for CD20, CD79a, and CD10 (Fig. b).
After follow-up for seven months, our patient was still alive with a considerably good health condition after surgery.

5305,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8009447-1,Extracted,"We report a case of a healthy 64-year-old female who originally presented to an outside emergency department with low-grade fever and a two-week history of worsening lower abdominal pain. She denied any nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, urinary dysuria, frequency, vaginal bleeding, or discharge. She denied any family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Past surgical history includes tubal ligation, and past medical history includes hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, and lung adenocarcinoma years ago that resulted in a left lobectomy. She reported having a previous colonoscopy many years ago without any signs of polyps or masses.
Vitals included height 1.676 m (5' 6""), weight 57 kg (126 lbs.), and BMI 20 kg/m². Physical exam was benign except for the following findings: fever of 38.0°C, moderate-to-severe tenderness with rebound and guarding in the lower abdomen and suprapubic region (right greater than left), and positive McBurney's point. As seen in Figure , the CT scan obtained in the emergency department showed findings concerning perforated appendicitis with subsequent abscess formation in the right lower quadrant.
Once the diagnosis was confirmed clinically and via radiographic imaging, she was transferred for definitive surgical and medical management. On hospital day 1, a percutaneous drain was placed with radiographic assistance with the return of purulent and serosanguineous fluid. Over the following days, her diet was slowly advanced and a repeat CT scan was obtained a few days after the original, as seen in Figure , which showed resolution of the right lower quadrant abscess collection. The drain was removed at that time, and the patient was discharged home with a course of oral antibiotics and plans for colonoscopy evaluation and ultimately an interval appendectomy.
The patient was seen three weeks post inpatient hospitalization to discuss the possible surgical intervention. At that time, the patient was feeling much better and tolerating a normal diet. She had appropriate bowel and bladder function and denied any pain, redness, fever, chills, or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical exam, the abdomen was soft and supple without any tenderness, distention, or masses present. The patient agreed on obtaining a colonoscopy in four weeks, which aligned with the standard of care of obtaining one 6-8 weeks after an acute perforation of the appendix.
Figures , demonstrate the colonoscopy findings that showed a tumor at the appendiceal orifice with pathology consistent with that of a tubulovillous adenoma. The patient met the surgeon the following week to discuss the findings and agreed on a right laparoscopic hemicolectomy in four weeks for a cancerous peri-appendiceal mass. Figure illustrates a staging CT scan that was obtained prior to the operation.
Laparoscopic exploration of the abdominal cavity revealed evidence of a grossly inflamed appendix with the adhesion of the appendiceal tip to the anterior abdominal wall, bladder dome, and right ureter. The surgeon performed a partial appendectomy with associated right hemicolectomy for oncological purposes with clip placement at the anterior abdominal wall for future identification of appendicular tip should cancer or positive margins be encountered. A functional anastomosis between the distal ileum and transverse colon was successfully completed. Visualization of the peritoneal cavity during the procedure showed no evidence of carcinomatosis, obvious metastatic disease, or malignant ascites.
The patient returned to the office two weeks after the surgery. Pathology from the procedure showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the appendix with invasion through the muscularis propria into at least the peri-appendiceal adipose tissue. Carcinoma was present at the mesenteric margin as a solitary tumor deposit, which was felt to be the transected appendiceal tip margin. Perineural and lymphovascular invasion was present. Fifteen lymph nodes were found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/15). Tumor was staged at least a T3 given uncertain involvement of the appendiceal tip and bladder wall. On physical examination, the abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended, and had no signs of masses or hernias. The surgical incisions were all clean, dry, and intact without any signs of infection or erythema.
The patient's care was then transferred to an outside hospital for evaluation by Surgical Oncology and discussion of further treatment options. A discussion was held to obtain repeat PET/CT imaging in three months to further evaluate the tumor for possible future en bloc resection with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [57.0, 'kg']}",97.0,92.15,101.85,"The patient's weight is 57.0 kg.

He was hospitalized due to the symptom of abdominal distension. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated small intestine indicating mechanical bowel obstruction (Fig. ). The night of first hospital day, he developed a loss of consciousness, and the next morning, he developed whole body cramping. The patient had no previous history of hepatic disease and no episodes of confusion or neurological disorders. He was no taking any medications for any diseases.
The laboratory data indicated an inflammatory reaction with the elevation of the white blood cells count of 23,600/μl and a C-reactive protein concentration of 7.33 mg/dl and hyperchloremic acidosis, with Na 144 mEq/l, K 3.1 mEq/l, Cl 116 mEq/l, pH 7.116, PO2 145 mmHg, PCO2 34 mmHg, BE −16.8 μmol/l, and HCO3− 11.3 μmol/l. Furthermore the serum ammonia (NH3) level was highly elevated to 703 μg/dl.
The level of tumor markers, CEA and CA19-9, were elevated at 7.9 ng/ml and 43.6U/ml, respectively. The liver and renal functions were normal. The culture of urine indicated the existence of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) indicated the huge tumor occupying minor pelvic space which was suspected to invade the ureter and urinary bladder (Fig. a). Two liver metastases with the sizes of 1.1 and 1.2 cm were also observed (Fig. b and c).
A water-soluble contrast enema showed rectovesical fistulae as well as ileal fistulae (Fig. a, b). Colonoscopy indicated the presence of a rectal carcinoma occupying total space at 15 cm far from the anal verge (Fig. ). The biopsy of the tumor indicated well differentiated adenocarcinoma.
We administered a solution of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and antibiotics. Furthermore, we repeatedly irrigated the bladder through the urethral catheter. The patient’s symptoms recovered, and serum ammonia levels on second and third hospital day were decreased to 210 and 135 μg/dl, respectively. However, the symptoms of infection and confusion were suspected to repeat; we elected to perform a surgical treatment.
On the operative findings, ascites and disseminated tumors were not observed. However, the tumor could not be resected due to the invasive growth in the minor pelvic space. The surgical procedure we adopted was as follows. We disconnected both oral and anal sides of ileum which was involved in the tumor and made an ileocecal bypass. Furthermore, we performed sigmoidostomy to prevent feces pouring into the urinary bladder.
We continued irrigation of urinary bladder through the bladder catheter after the operation. The postoperative clinical course was no eventful. Serum ammonia values had been kept under 120 μg/dl.
He was treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin/capecitabine) for 11 cycles. However, massive ascites had been developed 1 year after the operation, and the patient died from peritoneal metastases.
The vesicular catheter had been kept during the whole period after operation, and hyperammonemia had never occurred.
It has been noted that a urinary diversion may sometimes be the cause of non-hepatic hyperammonemic encephalopathy []. However, the frequency of this complication is not known and considered to be extremely rare. Some cases have been reported in patients who underwent a urinary diversion due to bladder or prostate cancer []. To the best of our knowledge, only one case with rectal cancer was previously reported in the Japanese literature, in which the patient suffered from a rectovesical fistula and liver dysfunction due to multiple liver metastases [].
Approximately 10 % (17/178) of the patients who underwent surgical treatment to create an ileal conduit developed hyperchloremic acidosis according to the report by Schmitt et al. []. However, hyperammonemic encephalopathy was not observed in several reviews on the complications of urinary diversion [–]. Urea-splitting urinary tract infection has been noted to be crucial for the development of hyperammonemic encephalopathy [].
An elevation of the blood ammonia levels may result from the diversion of the urinary stream to the intact intestine, which provides an additional amount of ammonia that must be absorbed, especially when there is urine stasis in the bowel. Urea in the bowel is converted by urea-splitting bacteria to form ammonia. Ammonia chloride is generally reabsorbed and broken down to liberate free ammonia and hydrochloric acid. In the absence of liver dysfunction, the additional ammonia can be managed by the liver; however, in a damaged liver, the extra ammonia cannot be managed, resulting in hyperammonemia. Even with a normal liver function, urease-producing bacteria may form large amounts of ammonia, thereby, leading to hyperammonemia.
The sudden onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the present case was caused by two mechanisms: urinary stasis and infection, which were induced by bowel obstruction.
Regarding the treatment of hyperammonemic encephalopathy, a bladder catheter was required to prevent urinal stasis and irrigation of bladder and antibiotics and hyperammonemia-reducing drugs were administered. However, surgical treatment is ultimately required to prevent the occurrence of repeated infection and hyperammonemia.
Concerning the surgical procedures, we could not divide the cystic bladder from rectum because of the invasive growth of the tumor. We performed surgical management only for bowel obstruction, ileal disconnection with ileocecal bypass, and sigmoidostomy. Therefore, the serum ammonia value was kept slightly high around 80~120 μg/dl after surgery, and bladder catheter was needed during the post operative period. Consequently, these comprehensive treatments were considered to be effective to prevent the repeated hyperammonemic encephalopathy.",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [116.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [11.3, 'µmol/L'], 'Sodium': [144.0, 'mEq/L']}",15.989,15.19,16.788,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 116.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 11.3 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from µmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 11.3 µmol. To convert from 11.3 µmol to mEq, first convert from µmol to mmol. To convert 11.3 µmol of bicarbonate to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 11.3 µmol bicarbonate * 0.001 mmol/µmol = 0.011 mmol bicarbonate. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 11.3 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 0.011 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 11.3 µmol bicarbonate/L converts to 0.011 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (116.0 mEq/L + 0.011 mEq/L) = 27.989 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 27.989 mEq/L.
Plugging in 27.989 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 27.989 - 12 = 15.989 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 15.989 mEq/L."

On physical examination, he weighed 63.0 kg and was 176 cm tall. The patient had diabetes for 20 years and suffered from diabetic retinopathy. He had unremarkable medical and family histories, but a smoking history of 90 packs per year. Chest CT revealed a 30 mm mass in the right upper lung lobe and mediastinal lymph nodes with advanced calcification (Fig ). Transbronchial biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) showed increased tumor uptake, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.16, and slight FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes. No metastases were detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging or FDG-PET (Fig ). Mediastinal lymph node #4 had a short-axis diameter < 1 cm, but was considered potentially to be lymph node metastasis because of the slight accumulation of FDG-PET; therefore, preoperative adjuvant treatment was performed. HgbA1c of 10.5 indicated diabetes was poorly controlled and required treatment before surgery. Diabetic nephropathy did not coexist and blood calcium and phosphate concentrations were within the standard range. During diabetes treatment, he received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The patient achieved no significant radiological improvement with two courses of this regimen. Based on radiological findings, he was diagnosed with yc-T1cN0M stage 1A, and surgical treatment was planned. He underwent right upper lobectomy and dissection of the upper mediastinal lymph nodes (2R and 4R). The lymph nodes were firmly adherent to the surrounding tissue, the sidewall of the superior vena cava was firmly fused, and there was invasion of the vascular wall. Despite this, the lymph nodes and superior vena cava sidewall were removed. The chest drain tube was removed on postoperative day 3 and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 14. Macroscopically, the tumor was well circumscribed and most of the tumor was calcified (Fig ). There was no bronchial or pleural involvement within the tumor. Acinar adenocarcinoma tissue was mixed with calcified tissue and PBs were confirmed. Similar features were found in calcified lymph nodes. The tumor was diagnosed as p-T2aN2M0 stage 3A (Union for International Cancer Control eighth edition). Immunohistochemistry revealed tumor cells positive for parathyroid hormone-related proteins (PThrP) 1 and 2. Postoperative examination indicated PThrP levels were within the standard range.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [176.0, 'cm']}",71.369,67.801,74.937,"The patient's gender is Male.

3534,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-5490092-1,Extracted,"A 54-year-old female (weight 55 kg, 160 cm) was referred by an orthopedic surgeon to our pain clinic for persistent low back pain radiating down to right leg. She had a history of low back pain associated with radiculopathy, which was more on the right side and radiated till the big toe for more than 6 weeks. The impression on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right paracentral disc protrusion at levels L4-L5, L5-S1 causing thecal sac indentation, effacement of the right lateral recess and right exiting nerve root impingement. There was no associated lumbar canal stenosis and no evidence of facet arthropathy. She had been taking analgesics tablet diclofenac 650 mg, tablet pregabalin 75 mg, tablet nortriptyline 10 mg, and regular physiotherapy for the last 6 weeks. She even underwent an epidural steroid injection (ESI) through the caudal route with 4 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1 ml of methylprednisolone, and 5 ml of normal saline at a tertiary care center 4 weeks back after which her symptoms improved marginally for a period of 1 week and then she again started with debilitating pain, not getting relieved with analgesics and other modes of conservative management. The complete motor and sensory examination of the patient revealed motor power of Grade V, i.e. the muscle can move the joint; it crosses through a full range of motion against gravity and resistance. The sensations were intact as elicited by pain, temperature, vibration, position sense, stereognosis, and two-point discrimination. All the superficial and deep tendon reflexes were intact with an SLR of 10° on the right side and 70° on the left side. The patient had full control over the bladder and bowel.
We hence planned, fluoroscopic-guided transforaminal ESI (TFESI) using clonidine as an adjuvant at levels L4-L5 and L5-S1 on the right side, after discussing both with the patient and the orthopedic surgeon.
After taking an informed written consent, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was secured. All routine monitors (electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) were attached. The patient was positioned on the operating room table with a pillow underneath the abdomen in the prone position. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the standard safe triangle was identified with pedicle of the vertebrae forming one arm of the triangle, lateral border of vertebral body forming the second arm, and the hypotenuse being formed by the exiting nerve root. Under all aseptic precautions, the skin overlying the target area was anesthetized with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine. The level of the epidural injection was chosen depending on the MRI findings and physical examination as L4- L5 and L5-S1.
A 22-gauge spinal needle was then advanced under fluoroscopy aiming the needle at the superior and anterior part of the intervertebral foramen through the safe triangle. The needle placement was confirmed after injecting 1–2 ml of omnipaque, nonionic water-soluble contrast medium iohexol dye, demonstrating the contrast going through the foramen. Furthermore, the confirmation of the needle position with contrast dye reduced the possibility of misplacement or intravascular placement of the needle, which is always a risk in ESIs performed without fluoroscopy. The needle was advanced into the safe triangle, and its placement was then confirmed both by anteroposterior and lateral view. One milliliter methylprednisolone (40 mg) mixed with 0.5 ml clonidine (50 μg) and 1 ml bupivacaine 0.5% were given at each level (volume 2.5 ml).
After the completion of the procedure, the patient was transferred to the recovery area. The patient's hemodynamic parameters were monitored during and after the procedure. Assessment of pain relief and any motor or sensory deficit was checked immediately and then hourly after the procedure till discharge from the recovery area.
The patient was discharged after having met the following discharge criteria after 2 h:
The patient was able to walk unaided The patient was able to void her bladder without any difficulty.
She was assessed for any numb or weak feeling in her back or legs for a few hours after the injection.
After 24 h, the patient was discharged from the hospital, and there was a significant improvement in the pain with an improvement in the SLR to 60°.
Following instructions were given at the time of discharge:
To report any untoward incident To continue taking analgesics as advised To start back muscle strengthening exercises after 3 days if there was considerable pain relief.
Patient was then reassessed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months interval after the procedure. There was a significant improvement in the pain after single injection of TFESI using clonidine as depicted by the visual analog scale (VAS) score; there was a much reduced drug dose intake and an improvement in the daily life activities as stated by the patient.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [160.0, 'cm']}",52.382,49.763,55.001,"The patient's gender is Female.

Laboratory investigations including alpha-fetoprotein were within normal limits. X-ray abdomen showed mass impression pushing the gut shadows to one side. Bones and calcifications were also evident in the right hemi-abdomen. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a heterogeneous mass with calcifications suggestive of teratoma. Abdominal CT scan showed a 9.2cm × 10.0cm heterogeneous mass containing fat, bones and soft tissues. The various bones were vertebrae, long bones like femur, tibia and fibula, and bones of hand/feet (Fig.1). Provisional diagnosis of FIF was made.
At operation, a mass covered in whitish-gray membrane, pushing the gut loops to the opposite side in the upper retroperitoneum, was found (Fig.2). The membrane was incised to find a fetiform mass floating in clear fluid having a few well differentiated and other rudimentary organs. The fetiform mass was suspended in the amnion like cavity with an umbilical cord like stalk (Fig.3). The mass with sac was mobilized and excised completely.

A further brain MRI scan, carried out when he was twelve, revealed a small pituitary gland. GH treatment has been advised and the patient has just started this therapy.
Written informed consent was obtained from the parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.
At birth, karyotype on peripheral blood lymphocytes was requested because of mild hypotonia and minor dysmorphic features.
Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed an interstitial deletion on chromosome 11 from bands 11q13.5 to 11q21 (Figure A). The parents’ karyotypes were both normal and the analysis was extended to 100 metaphases to rule out 11q deletion mosaicism. At the age of twelve, a comparative genomic hybridization array (Array-CGH) was performed using a CGH + SNP 4 × 180 K microarray kit (Agilent Technologies). The microarray contained 110,172 probes with a median probe spacing of 25.3 Kb (5 KB in International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays Consortium, ISCA) and 59,647 SNP (UCSC hg19, ). Array-CGH was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies) and allowed the identification of a more distal deletion of 17,2 Mb in size: from 11q14.3 to 11q22.3 (from nt 92,434,272 to nt 109,584,301)(555 probes with median Log2ratio value of −1.04). In the same region, 337 SNP probes showed a single allele (Figure B,C). No additional pathogenetic Copy Number Variations (CNVs) were detected. The molecular karyotype, defined following the International System of Chromosome Nomenclature 2013, was: arr 11q14.3q22.3(92,434,272-109,584,301)x1.
At 1 month of age, the proband’s neurological examination showed no major dysfunctions; clinical observation according to Prechtl´s Method on the Qualitative Assessment of General Movements [] showed a pattern characterized by Poor Repertoire. His motor milestones were not significantly delayed: control of the head at 4 months, sitting without support at 8 months, hands and knees crawling at 11 months, standing with assistance at 13 months, walking alone at 24 months.
Parents reported vocalization, babbling and the first word “mamma” being uttered at one year of age. “Mamma” remained the only word used to name everything word until 19 months of age. After a period of hospitalization following an accidental fall which caused clavicle fracture and a second spell in hospital due to gastroenteritis, the child presented an arrest in speech and psychomotor competencies. These aspects were inscribed in a global regression of communicational and relational capacities.
Speech development between 20 and 36 months was characterized by: aphonia, amimia, pseudo- articulatory movements, reduced opening of the labial rima. Moreover, the child showed a poor communicative intent even at a non verbal level.
At 3 years he was a clumsy, passive and withdrawn child, not interested in playing. Therefore, at 3 years of age a psychomotor treatment with attention to relational aspects was introduced twice a week.
During the first year of rehabilitation, the proband reduced his more passive traits becoming more and more purposeful, actively responsive and assertive. Communicative intention emerged together with the increasing awareness of his speech difficulties.
There was a large discrepancy between the verbal comprehension (discrete) and expressive skills: he used gestures associated with vocalization to indicate, to formulate questions, to express disappointment or excitement. Then, speech therapy sessions began twice a week at the age of 4.
The proband showed a deficit of phonetic and non-phonetic phonation. Later, rhinolalia and rhinophonia, and a deficit in coordination and in phonological memory were observed. Consequently, a double diagnosis of specific expressive language disorder and of childhood apraxia of speech was formulated.
At 5 years, after one year of speech therapy, he achieved a quite complete phonetic repertoire, vocabulary increase with risk threshold for semantic errors, and emerging narrative skills. While he showed an adequate lexical comprehension, morphosyntactic comprehension was delayed of one year and communication was supported by mimics and gestures. At the same time, he developed social skills, showing more relational and playing capacities with peers and adults.
At age 6, verbal speech was sufficiently intelligible despite the persistence of hypotonic and uncoordinated glosso-velo-pharyngeal muscles.
His cognitive development, as measured by WIPPSI Scale, was in the lower limits of the normal range, with a discrepancy between verbal (VIQ) and performance (PIQ) scores (VIQ =85; PIQ =96; Full Scale IQ = 89) [].
At the age of 8, the proband presented an impairment in the ability of naming objects and in lexical retrieval with the help of phonemic cues. On using the Italian version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [], comprehension was almost adequate (Language quotient = 82).
Morphosyntactic comprehension using the Rustioni Metz test [] showed a delay of about 2 years. The verbal short term memory span was 3 (inadequate).
Moreover, learning difficulties in the presence of a cognitive development at the lower limit of the normal range emerged. In particular, reading comprehension, measured using the MT battery of tests [], was inadequate (correct answers: 6/10), in the absence of dyslexia and dysorthography, as measured with the Dyslexia and Orthographic coding test []. Therefore, the logopedic rehabilitation continued until the child was 9 years old, with the aim to improve oral and written language comprehension. In the meantime, his writing and reading abilities supported him in planning the phonological string in speech.
Afterwards, counselling to parents and teachers, together with neuropsychiatric follow up continued until today with longitudinal controls (twelve years). We considered highly important to support parents and teachers in finding a harmonious global development which could take into account not only the educational aspects, but also the emotional and relational sides.
We were able to observe a global improvement in cognitive abilities (as illustrated in Figure D, where WISC III at 9 and 11 years of age are compared) [].
Currently the child shows good skills at school in the application of the learned mechanisms, but he has more difficulties when logic skills and problem solving abilities are required. However, he is able to evaluate his work and adopt compensatory strategies in order to overcome his difficulties. He is competitive with his schoolmates, comparing their tests results and scores. He shows a good personal and social independence and participates in curricular and extracurricular activities with peers.",What is the patient's body surface area?

During childhood he had to admit to hospital frequently (5-6 episodes per year) due to severe pneumonia. Under medical treatment and follow-up, all cardiac septal defects recovered spontaneously and pulmonary hypertension resolved. Since 4 years old, severe pneumonia became less frequent with 1-2 episodes per year. Skeletal anomaly particular noted with agenesis bilateral 5th toes.
On referral, his serum biochemical panel from previous hospital show intermittent disorders of liver function as in .
On admission at our hospital, he presented growth retardation and mild mental impairement, transient postprandial drowsiness, and loss of concentration. His height was in standard range, but his weight was 6.1 kg less than standard reference (comparable with 8 year-old boy) and was evaluated as Tanner stage 1. For mental problem, he had trouble to cope with his friends and stayed at class level 1 elementary school while his friends went to the 4th class. He can still remember simple things like parents name, his home address and so on; but got a long and hard for simple summation (within 10), can only spell but didn’t read well. On psychology examination, he was evaluated with Raven Colour Test: IQ 80 (ICD-10-CM: F70 - Mild intellectual disabilities) and Vineland Test 90 points.
Clinically, there were abdomen discomfort due to mild hepato-splenomegaly.
His total and direct bilirubin was 49.8 and 24.8 µmol/L (our hospital normal range was <21 and 5.1, respectively). AST 133.5 U/L and ALT 135.5 U/L (<35 and 35).

Intraoperative we found the native liver was almost dominated by a huge mass (mainly in the right liver). Mobilizing the whole liver from its ligaments, we confirmed that the patient had no right hepatic vein, the middle and left hepatic vein joined into a common trunk, draining into the IVC. The superior mesenteric vein confluenced with splenic vein before draining directly into the inferior vena cava (Abernethy anomaly type 1b), just 3 cm below and to the left of the draining site of hepatic vein complex into the IVC. The so-called portal vein measured of 10mm diameter and ran a 3 cm distance to the IVC (-). Anatomopathology findings of the native liver showed chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis 4/6 Knodel-Ishak ().

3943,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-6477550-1,Extracted,"A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.
Upon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th–75th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th–75th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4–48 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.
A right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm ×2.2 cm×2.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()
Postoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [162.8, 'cm']}",54.918,52.172,57.664,"The patient's gender is Female.

5059,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-7748566-1,Extracted,"A three-day-old male neonate presented to the pediatric ER with a one-day history of lethargy, reluctance to feed, and respiratory distress. He was born of a consanguineous marriage at 39 weeks’ gestation via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at home. According to the maternal report, she had no antenatal visits and delivery was uneventful. On further inquiry, it was found that the patient had three male siblings who expired in the early neonatal period, succumbing to similar complaints as that of the patient. The cause of their death was, however, unidentified.
On arrival in the ER, the child was noted to be a plethoric, macrosomic baby with no dysmorphism weighing 4 kilograms (90th percentile) with length and head circumference within the normal limits. On physical examination, the patient looked sick, jaundiced, and drowsy, with the following vital signs: temperature 37°C, respiratory rate 62 breaths per minute, pulse 140 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and capillary blood sugar of 22 mg/dL. Palpation of the abdomen revealed a firm, non-tender, enlarged liver, 5 cm below the costal margin. No other viscera were palpable. Neurological examination showed poor neonatal reflexes. Respiratory examination revealed tachypnea, subcostal recessions, and bilateral equal entry of air. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
The patient was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and baseline investigations were run. Complete blood counts and renal function tests returned within the normal ranges. Liver function tests revealed conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (direct bilirubin = 61.5 μmol/L), mildly elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 106 U/L), and deranged coagulation profile (international normalised ratio (INR) = 1.8). For detailed results at admission, see Table . Results of the laboratory evaluation were notable for hypoglycemia (blood sugar level = 18 mg/dL; 0.999 mmol/L) and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (anion gap = 24). Blood was drawn during the period of hypoglycemia and sent for insulin levels and serum ketones. First voided urine during the hypoglycemic episode, requesting glucose, ketones, and reducing substances was also sent.
An intravenous bolus of 10% dextrose at the rate of 2 mL/kg was given to correct the hypoglycemia. Vitamin K was administered to treat the raised INR. Intravenous antibiotics were empirically started to cover for presumed sepsis. Despite the above measures, his hypoglycemic state persisted along with a reluctance to feed, therefore, 10% dextrose at the rate of 60 mL/kg/day was intravenously started. The glucose infusion rate was eventually raised to 17 mg/kg/min to maintain his blood sugar levels. Critical samples sent during the hypoglycemic episode yielded negative serum ketones and a serum insulin level of 5 μU/mL (34.7 pmol/L). Urine samples returned negative for ketones and reducing sugar as well. Results of critical samples are mentioned below in Table . Oral diazoxide was started at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day to treat the hyperinsulinemia. The dosage was later increased to 15 mg/kg/day to meet the patients’ requirements.
Suspicion was high for a metabolic disorder therefore further investigations were run. Urine samples for organic acid chromatography yielded two peaks of succinyl acetoacetate, confirming the diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia. Plasma tyrosine and methionine levels were 400 μmol/L and 437 μmol/L, respectively. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were also raised (AFP = 450 ng/mL). Parents were counseled about the treatment options including dietary management with tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted formula and medical management with nitisinone, which is an effective treatment if started early in life. Late complications and the grave consequences, if left untreated, resulting in liver failure and the need for liver transplant in the future were also discussed. At the time of writing the report, the patient was transferred to a tertiary care hospital and was being managed with oral diazoxide at a dosage of 15 mg/kg/day along with a tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted formula. The patients' family, however, refused treatment with nitisinone due to the high cost. Genetic counseling was done regarding the risk of disease in future pregnancies and the role of DNA mutation analysis along with measuring succinyl acetoacetate in amniotic fluid during the antenatal period for prenatal diagnosis was highlighted to the family.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [4.0, 'kg']}",16.0,15.2,16.8,"The patient's weight is 4.0 kg.

2770,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-8582768-1,Extracted,"A 48-year-old white male presented to the clozapine clinic for routine follow-up and monitoring. The past medical history was significant for schizoaffective disorder; tobacco use disorder; constipation; vitamin D deficiency; and metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity, dyslipidemia, and prediabetes. Current medications included clozapine 150 mg by mouth at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily, docusate 100 mg by mouth twice daily, and cholecalciferol 2000 units by mouth daily. He tried and failed multiple antipsychotics prior to initiation of clozapine 4 years ago. His mental health had been stable since initiating clozapine, and he resides in a group home. He gained 9.5 kg the year after clozapine was initiated, and then weight stabilized. He had difficulty controlling his diet at the group home and ate what was prepared for him. Despite lifestyle education, he continued to visit the vending machine frequently for soda (2 cans per day), candy bars (1 per day), and chips (1 bag per day). He was referred to a dietitian but was unable to successfully implement dietary changes. He did not have access to exercise equipment at his group home and did not walk outside due to inclement weather. He was referred to an exercise program located in the same facility as the clozapine clinic but did not attend the appointments. Metformin initiation for weight management and prediabetes was recommended at several appointments, but he declined because he preferred not to take more medications. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day and was not interested in smoking cessation services.
His resting BP was elevated at his past 2 appointments (136/84 and 136/86 mm Hg), so the nurse at his group home had been recording daily BP readings in a log. His BP log revealed an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg. Pertinent vital signs and fasting laboratory results from the appointment were as follows: height: 5 feet, 10 inches; weight: 104.5 kg; BMI: 33 kg/m2; BP: 138/88 mm Hg; pulse: 79 bpm; hemoglobin A1c = 6%; TC = 225 mg/dL; LDL = 136 mg/dL; triglycerides = 395 mg/dL; HDL = 27 mg/dL; clozapine level = 132 mcg/L; norclozapine level = 135 mcg/L; white blood cell count = 8.4 thousand cells/mcl; and absolute neutrophil count = 5.1 thousand cells/mcl.
Clozapine is considered high risk for causing increases in weight, lipids, BG, and BP. This patient had already tried and failed multiple antipsychotics, and his mental health had been stable for 4 years on clozapine. Switching to an antipsychotic with lower liability for metabolic AEs is likely not a feasible option for this patient. Lifestyle interventions are a first-line treatment approach, but the patient had been unsuccessful with altering his diet, exercising, or attempting smoking cessation. Therefore, medically treating the metabolic AEs was necessary.
Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered the cornerstone of treatment for lipid lowering due to evidence demonstrating they can prevent ASCVD. There are 4 categories of patients that may benefit from statin therapy, including those with clinical ASCVD, LDL ≥190 mg/dL, diabetes aged 40 to 75 years, and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score ≥7.5%. An online ASCVD risk estimator can be located at . Individuals with an ASCVD risk score of 7.5% to <20% are considered intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event, and a moderate-intensity statin can be initiated if risk enhancers favor it. Examples of risk-enhancing factors include but are not limited to metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, HIV), ethnicity (eg, South Asian ancestry), and persistently elevated triglycerides (≥175 mg/dL). Individuals with an ASCVD risk score ≥20% are considered high risk, and statin initiation should be considered with a goal to reduce LDL by at least 50%. Moderate-intensity statins are expected to lower the LDL by 30% to 49% and high-intensity statins by ≥50% ().
Statins are most effective for lowering LDL, but they can also lower triglycerides (22% to 45%) and increase HDL (5% to 10%). Fibrates and niacin are effective for reducing triglycerides but have a mild LDL-lowering effect, and there is not enough evidence to routinely support their use as add-on medications to a statin. Adding a fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids to a statin is recommended for patients with persistently elevated severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. Fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil in patients being treated with a statin due to lower risk of myopathy. The dose of the statin is another important consideration. The largest percentage of LDL lowering is achieved with the initial dose., Each doubling of the statin dose should then lead to an additional 4% to 7% reduction in LDL., Clinical experience indicates that starting statins at a low dose and titrating up does not lead to the same level of LDL lowering as starting at a moderate- to high-intensity dose. Initiation of a lower intensity statin may be considered if there is a history of statin intolerance.
Stage 1 hypertension is defined as systolic BP 130 to 139 or diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is defined as BP ≥140/90 mm Hg. At least 2 resting BP readings obtained on 2 separate occasions should be used to estimate the BP. A log of home BP readings can provide a more accurate estimation of BP if proper techniques are used. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults, nonpharmacologic therapy and treatment with an antihypertensive is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension or stage 1 hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher. Initiation of 2 antihypertensive agents from different classes is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension. A BP target of <130/80 mm Hg is recommended. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are first-line treatments for hypertension due to evidence demonstrating that they reduce clinical events. There is inadequate evidence to support beta blockers as a first-line treatment for hypertension in the absence of certain cardiovascular comorbidities, such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease. Patient-specific factors, such as comorbidities, concurrent medications, age, race, and medication adherence, should be taken into consideration when selecting an initial antihypertensive.
The optimal treatment for hypertension in individuals with metabolic syndrome has not been clearly defined. Thiazide diuretics can increase insulin resistance and accelerate conversion to diabetes mellitus.,, They can also worsen dyslipidemia., The European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines list metabolic syndrome as a possible contraindication for use of thiazide diuretics. The ACC/AHA guidelines note that small increases in BG levels are possible but also state there are no data available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome who are treated with thiazide diuretics. When no compelling indications or contraindications are present to help guide treatment selection, preference may be given to an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB in patients with metabolic syndrome to help avoid increases in BG. Age and race can also help with treatment selection. Thiazide diuretics and CCBs are preferred in Black adults without heart failure or chronic kidney disease because they are more effective than ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Older adults may also respond better to thiazide diuretics and CCBs due to a declining number of nephrons and lower plasma renin levels.
Using an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg, the patient in this case had a 10-year ASCVD risk score of approximately 17.5%, placing him into a statin benefit group. His known risk-enhancing factors included metabolic syndrome, characterized by persistently elevated triglycerides, obesity, and elevated BP. He also smoked cigarettes. Lifestyle modifications continued to be encouraged, and a risk-benefit discussion about statin therapy was conducted. He was willing to initiate a statin and was started on atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth daily. A moderate-intensity statin was appropriate based on his 10-year ASCVD risk score. His triglycerides were elevated but not enough to warrant addition of a nonstatin therapy. His BP readings in the clinic and at home indicated he had stage 1 hypertension, and his 10-year ASCVD risk score was greater than 10%. The patient did not have any compelling indications or contraindications to help guide selection of an antihypertensive. Given his age, race, and history of metabolic syndrome, initiation of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB may be most appropriate.

The patient had a history of hypertension, type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertriglyceridemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic back pain and depression. Surgical history included left popliteal-femoral bypass and coronary artery stenting. He had 25-pack-years history of smoking, but denied significant alcohol or illicit drug use. His customary medications were lantus insulin, glimeperide, verapamil, losartan, aspirin, rosuvastatin, fenofibrate, cilostazole, esomeprazole, dicyclomine, eszopiclone, venlafaxine, alprazolam, testosterone lotion, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.
On physical examination, he was alert but not oriented, and in severe respiratory distress. Blood pressure (BP) was 160/94 mmHg in right arm, pulse rate was 140 per minute, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and temperature was 38.4oC. The Oxygen saturation via pulse oximeter was 86% while the patient was breathing 100% O2 by non-rebreather mask. There was decreased air movement at both lung bases, and consolidation at right lung base. Cardiac examination showed no abnormalities except tachycardia. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.
The initial labs and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are shown in and . Serum lactate at the beginning was elevated at 4.1 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-1 mmol/L). Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with rate of 144 beats per minute. A chest radiograph showed increased interstitial markings and right lower lobe infiltrates (). Urine analysis study revealed presence of urinary tract infection and results are shown in . He was immediately started on fluid replacement, intravenous (IV) antibiotics which included levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, and high flow oxygen, and was transferred to medical intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.
Later on, patient went into severe respiratory distress, and endotrachial intubation was performed. Soon after intubation, patient went into pulseless electrical activity, and a code blue was called. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was performed as per standard protocol for 15 minutes, and patient came back to sinus rhythm. After the code, patient was hypotensive and required three vasopressors including epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine to maintain systolic BP more than 90. Oxygen saturation was 90% on 100% FiO2. After one hour, patient again went into cardiac asystole, then ventricular fibrillation, and then pulseless electrical activity. Successful resuscitation was done for 15 minutes. After this second code, the systolic BP was in 80s, and IV phenylephrine was added. Hear rate was 146 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 88% on 100% FiO2. The laboratory results showed lactate level of 12.1 mmol/L; transaminase in 1000's and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 53 mg/dl and 4.9 mg/dl respectively. Serum troponin level was 2.92 ng/ml (normal ≤ 0.04 ng/ml). Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed worsening metabolic acidosis.
An emergent two-dimensional echocardiogram was obtained and revealed normal left and right ventricular function. His left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 50%, and there was no pericardial effusion, or right ventricular strain. Patient was started on IV hydrocortisone, and anidulafungin was added to cover for fungal pathogens. A decision was also made to start patient on activated protein C infusion considering high risk of death. In addition, bicarbonate drip was also started.
Twelve hours after his admission to this hospital, patient started showing signs of anoxic brain injury. At that time, he was on maximum doses of five vasopressors, but was still hypotensive and tachycardic. The oxygen saturation decreased to 88% on 100% of FiO2. ABG at that time is shown in . Family meeting was called, and they requested for withdrawal of care. Thirty minutes later, care was withdrawn and patient expired within 10 minutes of extubation and stopping IV medications. Family refused autopsy.

8147,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4492330-1,Extracted,"A 72-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation and proper management of a pancreatic mass. Six months ago, she underwent a radical subtotal gastrectomy with gastroduodenostomy (Billroth I) due to early gastric cancer. This pancreatic mass was incidentally identified on a postoperative follow-up abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. Her body weight was 39 kg and the height was 144 cm (body mass index, 18.8). A physical examination finding was an upper midline abdominal skin incision in the abdomen, which was soft and flat without palpable mass. All routine blood laboratory tests including amylase and lipase were within normal ranges. Also tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125) were within normal limits. In the CT scan, an approximately 2.5 cm-sized mass near the neck of the pancreas with distal duct dilatation and a parenchyma atrophic change abutting to the portal vein was identified. No lymph node enlargement or distant metastasis was detected ().The 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) showed approximately 2.6 cm-sized low-attenuating pancreatic mass in the body portion without significantly increased FDG uptake in any other organs (). Pancreaticobiliary magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiography showed about 2.5 cm-sized hypervascular, T2 low signal, fat-containing, well-defined mass in the neck area with distal parenchymal atrophy and duct dilatation (). The characteristics of the tumor seemed to be somewhat different from usual ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and serum AFP was checked. It was elevated to 2,254.1 IU/ml (reference range: 0-7.0 IU/ml).
The patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). During the laparotomy, malignant ascites, peritoneal seeding or distant metastasis were not found, but severe peritoneal adhesions due to the previous radical subtotal gastrectomy were noted. The anatomic plane was obscured during the PD due to the previous lymph node dissection around the celiac axis, common hepatic artery and the proper hepatic artery. Therefore, a dissection between the neck of the pancreas and superior mesenteric vein-splenic vein-portal vein confluence was needed to identify the anatomic landmark (). As previous lymph node dissection around major vessels was conducted already, a standard lymph node dissection was performed (). Due to the previous gastroduodenostomy the reconstruction of gastrointestinal continuity was easy following the PD. All procedures, pancreaiticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy were completed in a usual manner.
An 1.9×1.7 cm-sized ill-defined lobulating tumor confined to the pancreas was revealed in the macroscopic specimen examination (). An AFP-producing ACC of the pancreas (T1 stage) was classified based on the routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining ().
The postoperative recovery course was uneventful. The patient discharged 12 days postoperatively. For the potential possibility of application of chemotherapeutic agents in this rare case of pancreatic cancer, an ATP-CRA chemosensitivity test to anticancer drugs was performed (). The result showed cisplatin would potentially be more applicable than gemcitabine which is usually used in pancreatic cancer. Although the serum level of AFP had been dropped into normal range immediately after PD, it was rebounded exponentially 17 month postoperative (). The patient died due to carcinomatosis and pneumonia at 30 months after the surgery.",What is the patient's body surface area?

Ten days prior, he visited a local clinic with left upper back and shoulder pain. He was diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome and received a TPI with lidocaine using a 21-gauge, 2.0-inch needle in the left upper trapezius. Three days after the injection, he complained of substernal chest pain of a squeezing nature and chills, and visited the ED of another hospital. Coronary angiography at that hospital was normal. His symptoms progressively worsened despite administration of analgesics, and he was transferred to our hospital.
He was an active smoker, with a cumulative exposure of 35 pack-years, and a heavy drinker, consuming 1 bottle of alcohol daily. He did not have clinical evidence of a recent head and neck infection or trauma. He was 163 cm tall and weighed 60.3 kg (body mass index, 22.7 kg/m2). In the ED, his blood pressure was 120/78 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 97%, and axillary temperature was 38.2°C. A physical examination revealed tenderness and redness from the left side of the upper sternum to the same side of the shoulder. The other examination results were normal.
Laboratory data were significant for a white blood cell count of 19.9×109/L, with 86.7% neutrophils. Both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated, at 26.5 mg/L (reference, <0.5 mg/dL) and 80 mm/hr (0–10 mm/hr), respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.48, PCO2 28 mmHg, PO2 115.3 mmHg, and HCO3 20.9 mmol/L. Serum glucose was 249 mg/dL and a urine test strip was 4+ for glucose. Other laboratory test results were normal, including plasma levels of electrolytes, troponin, and creatinine kinase-MB. Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were drawn before empirical antibiotic treatment.
Chest radiography showed upper mediastinal widening, protrusion of the aortic arch, and consolidation in the left upper lobe (). Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 3.8×3-cm outpouching low-density lesion with an infiltrative margin arising from the aortic arch, diffuse mild wall-thickening in the aorta, and an incidental 6.8-cm heterogeneous enhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe (). Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver suggested hepatocellular carcinoma in the S7 segment.
He was treated immediately with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and the initial blood culture revealed Staphylococcus aureus. Based on clinical and radiological features, he was diagnosed with DNM after TPI.
Fever persisted following the ED visit, and both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate remained elevated, at 23.6 mg/L and 37 mm/hr, respectively. Antibiotics were changed on hospital day 3 to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, intermittent fever persisted until hospital day 5, and finally subsided when the antibiotics were changed to meropenem and vancomycin.
On hospital day 9, he had hemoptysis. Follow-up CT showed increased mediastinal infiltration and a low-density lesion with an air bubble and a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer at the aortic arch (). Based on the CT, we explained the process of surgical drainage. However, he and his family refused aggressive management such as surgery, because of the risk of sudden death during the operation, poor prognosis of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma, and his age. Despite antibiotic therapy, his general condition worsened, and he authorized a do-not-resuscitate order.

Twenty years earlier she was diagnosed with breast cancer, subjected to mastectomy and then treated with several chemotherapy lines, including the inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor A Bevacizumab, hormonal therapy and local radiotherapy. About 5 months before the admission, she developed seizures and sudden cognitive impairment, with loss of contact: a MRI revealed cranial and cerebral metastasis. An antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam was started as well panencephalic radiotherapy was given for five days. Chemotherapy was also administered with resolution of symptoms and regression of metastasis. One month before the hospitalization, she developed lower limb deep vein thrombosis, so she started fondaparinux as anticoagulation therapy. The patient continued its oncological follow-up schedule of a stage IV breast cancer, with multiple liver, pleural, pulmonary and bone metastasis, treated with Palbociclib, anti-CDK4 and 6 antagonist and Fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor antagonist. At two follow-up visits during the 4 weeks prior to admission to the Emergency Department because of low circulating serum magnesium levels, magnesium and potassium salts supplementation was reported and then suspended due to the appearance of abdominal pain. She was sent to the Emergency department by the oncologist because of abdominalgia associated to nausea and vomiting. She has been treated with a proton pump inhibitor for at least 6 months because of heartburn, regurgitation, and symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux disease. An abdominal ultrasound highlighted abundant ascites. She was vigilant and collaborating, without alteration on neurological exam. Her vital parameters were normal, and laboratory tests showed mild anemia (Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dl, hematocrit 32%), no renal (creatinine 0.4 mg/dL) or hepatic (GOT 21 U/L; GPT 13 U/L; total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL) impairment and a moderate increase in C reactive protein (63 mg/L; normal values < 5 mg/L).

She was treated parenterally with loop of Henle diuretic therapy, furosemide associated with potassium sparing diuretic canrenoate, associated to water restriction. An abundant diuretic response and the reduction of ascites was observed in the 48 hours following, with a significant weight loss and an almost complete resolution of the abdominalgia. No changes in blood pressure or heart rate were measured. She suddenly presented confused and disoriented. She was not able to attempt a simple order and she complained headache. Her blood pressure was still normal and the neurological exam did not show any focal or lateral abnormality. Ammonium blood levels were normal (37 uM/L, normal values between 10-50). An urgent cerebral tomography was performed, showing a diffuse cerebral edema (,ABC). Patient neurological condition rapidly got worse, till vigil coma, with loss of interaction ability, while her vital parameters (blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation) remained normal.

The baby was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery with a birth weight of 2.97 kg. He was exclusively breast-fed. At 2-1/2 months of age, he developed frequent, large volume, watery stools with occasional blood streaks. There was no fever, emesis, or any infectious contacts. The family history was only significant for two paternal second-degree relatives with celiac disease and one-second degree relative with a thyroid disorder and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
On initial examination, the child appeared ill, pale, malnourished, and dehydrated. The weight was 5.19 kg (<3rd percentile), length was 59.7 cm (<3rd percentile), and head circumference was 40.5 cm (between 3rd and 10th percentile). Other than some diaper rashes, the physical examination was unremarkable with no atopic dermatitis or icthyosis.
The results of initial investigations are shown in . The absolute eosinophil count was only slightly elevated. Immunoglobulins including IgE were normal. The serum albumin was low, consistent with the protein losing enteropathy. Stool examination did not reveal any pathogens. Stool electrolytes showed secretory diarrhea. The antinuclear antibody and direct antiglobulin were negative.
Endoscopy and biopsies revealed acute and chronic inflammation, marked autoimmune enteropathy with total villous atrophy, and abundant CD3+ T- and CD20+ B-cell aggregates in the small intestine and colon.
Further immunological workup showed intact IL-10 receptor function since endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in mononuclear cells was suppressed by IL-10. Initial T- and B-cell phenotype analysis was normal. The percentage of circulating Treg cells and FOXP3 protein expression in these cells measured by flow cytometry were also normal (Figures and ).
Analysis of all coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of the FOXP3 gene was carried out. This revealed a hemizygous missense mutation (c.1190G > A, p.Arg397Gln) which would result in a nonfunctional FOXP3 protein and Treg cells, similarly in the patient's mother, who is a healthy career. The anti-islet cell antibody was negative, insulin-like growth factor-1 level was normal, and the patient never developed type 1 diabetes mellitus. Thyroid function was also normal.
The patient required intensive resuscitation with intravenous fluids. He was then managed with parenteral nutrition and high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. He was maintained on oral prednisone and tacrolimus. The clinical condition gradually improved, and he was able to initiate oral intake with an elemental formula in a few weeks.
The patient had a matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with reduced intensity conditioning including alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan at 8 months of age. Early transplant period was complicated with donor Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) reactivation treated with rituximab. He developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Initially, enteropathy significantly improved; however, colitis recurred 3 months after the transplant when, unfortunately, there was decreasing mixed chimerism and secondary bone marrow rejection. Donor lymphocyte infusions were unsuccessful, and the patient required a second transplant at 14 months of age from the same donor with busulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab conditioning this time.
Two years after the second HSCT, the patient has mixed chimerism and 65% of donor haematopoiesis but 91% of donor Treg cells (). The gut function gradually recovered, and graft-versus-host disease was ruled out on repeated gut biopsies.

Also, she had been diagnosed concomitant with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus presenting polyuria (4 L/day) and polydipsia (4-5 L/day) for 1 year. A water deprivation test showed central diabetes insipidus, and the initial finding of sellar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thickening of the pituitary stalk with normal high signal intensity in the posterior pituitary gland. She had been managed with metformin, estrogen, and oral 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, to which she had maintained well with about 2 L of daily urine volume. Follow-up MRI imaging had taken 2 years later demonstrated a nearly normal pituitary stalk thickness.
At the age of 14 years, she had been treated with additional drug, levothyroxine due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis induced primary hypothyroidism. At the age of 18 years, her intelligence quotient (IQ) score was 52, suggestive of mild mental retardation, while her social quotient was at a level of 8 years. After graduated high school, she entered a vocational school for mentally disabled people. In school, she volunteered for a class senator, attended school punctually at any situation. She actively talked in school, so she earned the nickname 'radio'. She was active and honest daughter who lives with parents and younger brother. There was no history of alcohol or drug abuse. None of family members had psychiatric illness or mental retardation.
Before 2 months prior to admission, she suddenly avoided to talk and go to school and redundantly wanted to sleep without social interaction. She developed excessive daytime sleepiness and bizarre behavior with auditory hallucination 2 weeks ago. After taking oral medication prescribed by a psychiatric clinic, her symptoms including insomnia, visual and auditory hallucination were exacerbated. On mental status examination at admission, she showed poverty of speech, dysarthria, anxious mood, auditory hallucination, visual hallucination, persecutory delusion, social withdrawal, soliloquy, avolition, and aggressive behavior.

The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 21 years old. The patient's is a Female.
The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult female's the total body water percentage value is 0.50.
The patient's weight is 51.5 kg. The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mEq. To convert from 133.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 133.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 133.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 133.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 133.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 51.5 * (133.0/140 - 1) = -1.29 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -1.29 L."

She was the first child of healthy consanguineous parents. The baby was born at term by vaginal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy and did not cry immediately after birth. On admission to the hospital, the baby was found to have episodes of breathlessness, with a respiratory rate of up to 100 breaths/min, alternating with apnea lasting for 15-20 s with cyanosis. On physical examination, her weight was 2500 g (<3rd percentile), her length was 47 cm (<3rd percentile) and her head circumference was 36.5 cm (3rd percentile). Facial features include broad forehead, arched eyebrows, left-sided squint, epicanthic folds and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism). Examination of the oral cavity revealed midline upper lip cleft and bilateral fleshy nodules on the under surface of the tongue, bumps of the lower alveolar ridge and high-arched palate []. Skeletal examination revealed post-axial as well as mesaxial (an extra digit between the middle digits) polydactyly of both hands and pre-axial polydactyly of both feet []. Other physical examination, findings were normal. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), hepatic enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, blood sugar and urine analysis were normal. Echocardiography, abdominal ultrasonography, especially of the kidney, ureter and bladder (KUB) region, and ophthalmological examination were found to be normal, except squint on the left side. X-ray of both hands documented mesaxial polydactyly as evident with Y-shaped metacarpal [].

1091,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-6732194-1,Extracted,"A 75-year-old Hispanic woman with extensive comorbidities including coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on warfarin therapy, presented with exertional chest pain for 1 month. Her chest pain was episodic, lasted for a few minutes, was triggered by activities, and alleviated by resting; it was associated with shortness of breath and leg swelling. She takes amlodipine 5 mg daily, losartan 25 mg daily for her hypertension, carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, aspirin 81 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg daily for coronary artery disease, as well as warfarin 6 mg daily for atrial fibrillation. She has a surgical history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, cholecystectomy, and arteriovenous fistula on her left arm. Her family history is positive for hypertension and diabetes. She was a former smoker of tobacco of half a pack a day for 30 years. She drinks alcohol occasionally. She was a housewife and lives with her son.
On admission, she had normal temperature of 36.89 ºC (98.4 ºF), elevated blood pressure of 155/75 mmHg, pulse rate of 73 per minute, respiratory rate of 19 per minute, and saturation of 95% on room air. A physical examination was significant for bibasilar lung crackles and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. A neurologic examination was unremarkable. A complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL with normal white cell count and platelets. A basic metabolic panel revealed elevated creatinine of 3.78 and was otherwise unremarkable. Troponin was noted to be mildly elevated at 0.051 ng/mL, which normalized the next day. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was also elevated at 1908.7 pg/mL. An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70 beats per minute. A chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with no focal consolidation (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with no evidence of focal wall motion abnormality.
A presumptive diagnosis of unstable angina was made and a transradial cardiac catheterization was planned. Warfarin was held before the catheterization and pre-procedure international normalized ratio (INR) was found to be 1.7. Establishment of access to her right radial artery was attempted with the use of ultrasound guidance and was successfully performed on the first attempt. However, she was noted to have a slight radial artery spasm during catheter manipulation. She was found to have 70–80% stenosis in distal left coronary circumflex artery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty using Guidezilla™ (Boston Scientific) 5 French catheter was performed. A Synergy™ (Boston Scientific) drug-eluting stent was then successfully placed. The procedure was not complicated by any difficult access or accidental catheter advances. A TR band (Terumo Corporation) was applied at the puncture site for 5 hours after the procedure and was then removed. Warfarin was resumed after the procedure and dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily was also started.
No sign of bleeding or swelling was noticed during the first day after the procedure. On the second day after the procedure, our patient developed significant right forearm swelling (Fig. ). An examination revealed a hard swollen mass that was tender to palpation. No bruits were appreciated. The swelling was initially treated with bandage compression, but there was no improvement. Doppler ultrasound was then performed which demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm from the radial artery located at the puncture site. The pseudoaneurysm measured 2.05 × 0.68 cm, with a neck size of 0.25 cm (Fig. a). A second more proximal pseudoaneurysm at the mid-forearm was also noted with a size of 0.70 × 0.60 cm and a neck size of 0.09 cm (Fig. b).
Vascular surgery was consulted for possible surgical intervention. Our patient was deemed to be a poor surgical candidate for surgical repair due to her comorbidities. A trial of compression therapy was recommended. Starting the second day after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), TR band compression was reapplied daily with the guidance of ultrasound. Each session lasted 2 hours and TR band was then removed. Distal pulse oximetry and Doppler ultrasound were obtained to ensure the patency of the radial artery during compression. Warfarin was held after the discovery of the pseudoaneurysms. Dual antiplatelet therapy was continued given the presence of coronary drug-eluting stent. A series of vascular Doppler ultrasounds were performed to evaluate if the pseudoaneurysm was still present. The treatment was well tolerated by our patient. After 2 days of TR band compression, the distal pseudoaneurysm thrombosed completely (Fig. c). After 4 days of daily TR band compression, the proximal pseudoaneurysm was noted to be partially thrombosed. She was discharged with a plan of out-patient follow-up with vascular surgery. Four days after discharge, the proximal pseudoaneurysm was found to have spontaneously thrombosed during the out-patient visit (Fig. d). No surgical intervention was required or performed. Warfarin was eventually resumed after closure of both pseudoaneurysms. A follow-up visit 7 months after discharge showed no recurrence of pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's heart rate is 91.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 9500.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min.

cultures were drawn, and patient was started on intravenous fluids and empiric intravenous
antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin). Follow-up troponin returned at 0.85, and heparin
drip was initiated. Patient was chest pain free. Serial EKG revealed persistent sinus
tachycardia without ST-segment changes. Computed tomography (CT) scan of brain showed
subacute infarcts in the cerebral hemispheres, and CT scan of chest and abdomen also showed

He complained of progressive proximal lower limb muscle weakness for 10 months before admission. He was admitted to our hospital because of upper and lower limb, neck flexor and extensor, and flexor and extensor digitorum muscle weakness, and pitting edema of the legs. He had a medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He had smoked five cigarettes per day for the decade before he turned 30.
On admission, predominantly proximal symmetrical muscle weakness and leg pitting edema were observed. His manual muscle testing (MMT) scores were: neck flexion = 4; neck extension = 4; deltoids = 3; biceps brachii = 3; triceps brachii = 3; flexor and extensor muscles of the hand = 4; flexor and extensor digitorum muscle = 3; iliopsoas = 2; gluteus maximus = 2; quadriceps = 2; hamstring = 2; flexor and extensor muscles of the foot = 5. His blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Laboratory tests on admission showed serum creatinine and albumin levels of 0.7 mg/dL and 2.9 g/dL, respectively, and his urinary protein creatinine ratio was 7.3 g/gCr, suggesting nephrotic syndrome. Serum creatine kinase (820 U/L), aldolase (13.7 IU/L), and urinary myoglobin levels were initially elevated, but after admission they normalized and myoglobinuria disappeared. All autoantibodies (i.e., antinuclear antibodies [ANA], anti-double stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA] antibodies, anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies, anti-La/SS-B antibodies, anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase [anti-ARS] antibodies, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibodies, anti-mitochondrial M2 [AMA2] antibodies, acetylcholine receptor [AChR] antibodies, and anti-muscle-specific kinase [anti-MuSK] antibodies) were negative. Although serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G was decreased (705 mg/dL), IgA (159 mg/dL) and IgM (37 mg/dL) were within normal range. Bence Jones protein (BJP)-lambda was observed in both the blood and urine, the serum free light chain lambda was 533 mg/L, the serum kappa/lambda ratio was 0.046, and the M protein level was 0.575 g/dL. The plasma cell count in the bone marrow was 0.7%, indicating MGUS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed proximal lower limb muscle atrophy and edema, including the quadriceps femoris, obturator, and gluteus maximus muscles (Fig. ). Needle electromyogram was performed in the first dorsal interosseous, deltoid, and iliopsoas muscles. Although it showed fibrillation potential and positive sharp waves, it also showed complex repetitive discharge, low amplitude, and early recruitment, suggestive of myogenic changes. Nerve conduction study of the median, ulnar, tibial, and sural nerves was normal (Table ). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with myopathy as the cause of the predominantly proximal symmetrical muscle weakness.
A muscle biopsy of the right vastus lateralis muscle was performed on the 25th day of admission. Light microscopy showed a small cluster of atrophic angulated fibers in addition to mild fiber size variation on hematoxylin and eosin (HE)–stained sections. On nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), some fibers minimally lacked oxidative activity (Fig. a). On modified Gomori trichrome, one atrophic fiber was filled with fine cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. b). Although we thought they were reminiscent of nemaline bodies, we could not confirm the nature of this structure as a sample for electron microscopic study was not available. Congo red positivity in the sarcolemma membrane and vascular walls was observed (Fig. c, d, e). Immunofluorescence staining of frozen muscle tissue showed that lambda and kappa light chains were negative (Fig. ). Considering the clinical course and histopathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with amyloid myopathy.
A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed on the 35th day of admission to determine the cause of nephrotic syndrome. Light microscopy showed an accumulation of eosinophilic, amorphous deposits in the mesangial region and part of the capillary walls in HE-stained sections (Fig. a), periodic acid–Schiff–stained sections (Fig. b), and periodic acid–methenamine-silver–stained sections (Fig. c), which were determined to be amyloid proteins as they were stained positive by direct fast scarlet staining (Fig. d). Amyloid proteins were also observed in the blood vessel walls. As these amyloid proteins were positive for p-component staining and negative for amyloid A staining, β2-microglobulin, and pre-albumin, we diagnosed the patient with AL amyloidosis. Approximately 40% interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was observed. Immunofluorescence staining of frozen tissue showed that lambda light chains were positive in the mesangial region (Fig. a). Staining with IgG, IgA, IgM, complement component 3 (C3)c, C1q, and kappa light chains were negative (Fig. b). Electron microscopy showed amyloid fibrils in the mesangial region (Fig. ). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with AL amyloidosis caused by BJP-lambda.
Each examination was subsequently performed for systemic amyloidosis. Although echocardiography showed mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction without characteristic findings for cardiac amyloidosis such as a classical granular sparkling appearance, we did not exclude cardiac amyloidosis because 1) both serum NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (369.7 pg/mL) and troponin T levels (0.166 ng/mL) were elevated and 2) the patient had a history of atrial fibrillation. Amyloid protein was negative in the colon biopsy. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with AL amyloidosis involving the kidneys, muscles, and possibly the heart.
The patient was treated with MD (melphalan, 8 mg and dexamethasone, 20 mg daily for 4 days) therapy for AL amyloidosis. Although his cardiac function and respiratory function did not decline, the muscle weakness grew worse, and the nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and serum free light chain level did not improve. Twenty-one months after therapy commenced, the serum creatinine level had increased to 1.2 mg/dL, and his MMT scores were: neck flexion = 3; neck extension = 3; deltoids = 2–3; biceps brachii = 2–3; triceps brachii = 2–3; flexor and extensor muscles of the hand = 2–3; flexor and extensor digitorum muscle = 2–3; iliopsoas = 1–2; gluteus maximus = 1–2; quadriceps = 1–2; hamstring = 1–2; flexor and extensor muscles of the foot = 2–3.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [83, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.2, 'mg/dL']}",60.004,57.004,63.004,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

5275,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8287740-1,Extracted,"A 23-year-old Asian female presented to rheumatology in February 2020 following GP referral with history of worsening pain and paraesthesia of the right upper limb since 2018. She was managing with simple analgesics and physiotherapy under care of musculoskeletal and neurology team. Her symptoms were initially intermittent but became persistent from August 2019 and had progressed to involve the neck, upper-back and left arm. The severity of pain was disrupting her daily activities and sleep.
She was a non-smoker and non-drinker. There was no significant past medical history, except migraine.
She had a family history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cancer, including thyroid and prostate cancer.
She was born in the UK to parents of Indian origin and had received the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine at birth. She travelled to India every other year to visit relatives. She had no known contacts of TB.
Her weight was 54 kg, and body mass index (BMI) was 21. On examination, there was slightly reduced power noted in the right upper limb and myofascial tenderness over the cervical and thoracic spine, but range of motion and reflexes remained fully intact.
Initial blood tests demonstrated elevated white cell count (WCC) of 14.8 × 109/L (normal range (NR) 4–11 × 109/L) with neutrophilia (12.0 × 109/L; NR 2–7.5 × 109/L), elevated C-reactive protein(CRP) (31.4 mg/L; NR < 5 mg/L), elevated total protein (89 g/L; NR 60–83 g/L) with hypergammaglobulinaemia (49 g/L; NR 7–16 g/L), alongside low vitamin D (63.4 nmol/L; NR > 70nmol/L). Auto-antibody screen including anti-nuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies were negative.
Previous electromyography and nerve conduction studies in February 2019 reported no evidence of nerve lesions and no myopathic features at the time. In December 2019, neurologist arranged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cervical spine, thoracic spine and brachial plexus which was initially reported as normal with respect to the spine and brachial plexus (Fig. ). However, on further review of MRI at rheumatology multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting, an anterior mediastinal mass and lung shadowing was noted. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis (Fig. ) demonstrated a cystic anterior mediastinal mass measuring 3.3 × 3.8 cm thought to be a necrotic node which is typical of TB. There was evidence of consolidation in the right upper lobe with ‘tree-in-bud’ appearance. ‘Tree-in-bud’ refers to involvement of the smaller airways—a finding commonly seen in TB. The case was referred to chest MDT and was diagnosed as likely pulmonary TB. However, in view of the clinical-radiological correlation, she did not have symptoms of cough, fever or chest pain at this time.
Although blood tests for enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay (ELISpot®) were negative for TB and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) smear was negative for acid fast bacilli (AFB), she was treated empirically with the quadruple-antitubercular treatment Voractive® (combined tablet of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) with 10 mg pyridoxine. The plan was to continue treatment and follow-up with repeat imaging in 2 months.
Within 2 weeks of commencing treatment, the woman developed continuous cough unable to sleep lying flat. She was advised to take simple cough linctus and continue with the treatment. However, her cough worsened, with progressive retrosternal discomfort.
Her care was transferred to a hospital closer to her home. The four-drug regimen was continued for 2 months followed by 1 month of Rifinah® (rifampicin and isoniazid) with pyridoxine 10 mg. Her cough and chest discomfort did not improve. Repeat blood tests performed in April and May 2020 showed haemoglobin fell from 117 g/L to 101 g/L, WCC was persistently elevated at 25.1 × 109/L and 20.2 × 109/L with raised neutrophils of 22.49 × 109/L and 19.62 × 109/L respectively. Follow-up chest X-rays (CXR) and repeat CT scan demonstrated new cavitating lesions in the right lung with further enlargement of the mediastinal mass (Fig. ). Sputum samples and repeat BAL sent for microscopy, culture and sensitivities (MC&S) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with GeneXpert® testing again yielded negative results for TB. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the lung and fluid aspiration of the mediastinal mass was performed. This yielded necrotic tissue on histology with negative AFB smear, negative GeneXpert® and microbiology. Following this, a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose—positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)-CT scan was performed demonstrating metabolically active necrotic lesions in the mediastinum and lung parenchyma (Fig. A and B).
Histological analysis of mediastinotomy-derived lung biopsies demonstrated samples contained a nodular infiltrate of lymphoid cells admixed with bands of sclerotic tissue. The lymphoid tissue was polymorphous composed of small mature lymphoid cells admixed with histiocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and some larger cells showing prominent nucleoli, binucleate forms and smudge cells. On immunohistochemistry, the large atypical cells were positive for CD30, CD15, MUM1, PAX5 and p53. They were negative for CD45, CD20, CD79a and CD3. The imaging and histological findings confirmed a diagnosis of Stage IVA classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (nodular sclerosing subtype) in June 2020.
TB treatment was discontinued and the patient was urgently referred to the haemato-oncology team and commenced on the escalated BEACOP-DAC regimen (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone and dacarbazine, with granulocyte colony stimulating factor). As time was of the essence, the option of cryopreservation of ova prior commencing chemotherapy was not possible. However, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue was offered. The FDG-PET-CT scan following the first two cycles demonstrated good response to chemotherapy (Deauville Score 3). Therefore, only two more cycles of escalated BEACOP-DAC were given. The post-chemotherapy FDG-PET-CT scan (Fig. C and D) showed resolution of disease, so no further treatment was indicated. At the time of writing, the patient was well and plan was to follow-up in haemato-oncology clinic.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [54.0, 'kg']}",94.0,89.3,98.7,"The patient's weight is 54.0 kg.

He took a colonoscopy examination at a private clinic showing multiple colonic polyps of varying sizes. He was referred to the Gastrointestinal Department of Presbyterian Medical Center.
There were no abnormalities in his past medical and family history such as gastrointestinal polyposis or colorectal cancer. He had been drinking about 1.5 bottles of Soju (Korean liquor) every day for 20 years.
He was showing chronic signs of illness, but his vital signs were relatively stable. He was 164.3 cm tall and weighed 47 kg (body mass index, 17.4). His physical examination revealed mild hair loss and hair pull test showed that more than 10 hairs were pulled out (). Black discolorations in both hands and feet were observed in limb examination (). Also, all fingernails of both hands were dry, cracked, and transformed ().
A peripheral blood test showed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 38.2%, and evidence of megalocytes with mean corpuscular volume of 105.2 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 36.1 pg, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 34.3%. The white blood cell count was 5,600/mm3 and platelet count was 209,000/mm3. Biochemical examinations showed aspartate aminotransferase of 35 IU/L, an alanine aminotransferase of 24 IU/L, total protein level of 5.5 g/dL, albumin level of 3.4 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.6 mg/dL, calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 10 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, Na/K/Cl/Co2 of 139/4.3/104/27 mEq/L, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen level of 5.8 ng/mL.
The esophagus was normal in gastroscopy, but several hundred strawberry-like polyps of varying sizes (0.5 to 2.5 cm) were observed in the stomach (). The number and sizes of the polyps increased in the distal stomach than in the proximal stomach. They were diagnosed as hamartomatous polyps from the biopsy. Rapid urease test (Campylobacter-like organism, CLO test) showed positive result and the stool Helicobacter pylori Ag were also positive. The duodenum was covered with multiple small hyperemic polypoid lesions and numerous tiny polyps on whole small bowel were also observed by capsule endoscopy, but these were not confirmed histologically (). Thousands of little grape-like polyps that were less than 10 mm in size and some colon polyps of more than 1 cm in size were observed during colonoscopy. Small scale-like hyperemic mucosa under the size of 1 mm was observed without normal mucosa in the terminal ileum. These colon polyps were resected by endoscopic method, and the pathologic results confirmed colon cancer (adenocarcinoma in situ) () and serrated adenoma ().
Colonoscopic polypectomy was performed on multiple polyps that were larger than 1 cm. Most of them were inflammatory polyps containing lamina propria, and proliferated tortuous and cystic dilated glands were observed (). However, adenocarcinoma in situ with background low grade tubular adenomas was confirmed in one of them (). Also, another polyp showed serrated architecture and cytological dysplasia of the crypts, corresponding to serrated adenoma ().
The patient was given a nutritional therapy under the diagnosis of CCS. Prednisolone of 40 mg/day was administered, and the dosage was reduced by 5 mg every week. H. pylori eradication (proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and metronidazole combination therapy for 2 weeks) was performed and the follow-up CLO test was negative.
At 4 months follow-up, although the patient appeared to have improved, hundreds of 0.5 to 2.5 cm-sized hyperplastic gastric polyps were not improved compared to the previous endoscopic findings. In the follow-up colonoscopy, numerous colon polyps were still discovered in the whole colon.

She was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and doxorubicin. After six cycles of chemotherapy, the supraclavicular lymph node was not palpable with a partial response of the breast cancer and the axillary nodes. She underwent a curative resection for the breast cancer, and the final pathologic stage was ypStageIIIC (ypT2N3M0). Immunohistochemistry showed negative staining for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Histological and nuclear grades were III/III and 3/3, respectively, and extensive endolymphatic tumor emboli were present. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) was commenced, but on her visit for the third cycle she complained of sudden-onset right chest pain and cough. Her chest X-ray was within normal limits (). Ten days later, she felt right inspiratory chest pain and was referred to the emergency department. She complained of dyspnea on exertion (DOE), cough, and a mild febrile sense, however, she denied the high fever, sputum, pitting edema, or orthopnea. Her initial vital signs were a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, blood pressure of 133/68 mmHg, body temperature of 36.5℃, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Signs of respiratory distress were not definite. Fine crackles in the right upper lung field were present on chest auscultation but a pleural friction rub was not present. A chest X-ray demonstrated patchy consolidation on the right upper lung field () and computed tomography (CT) showed right upper lobe (RUL) patchy consolidation with ill-defined small ground glass opacities (GGO) in the RUL and right lower lobe (RLL) (, respectively). The differential diagnosis from the radiological study was pneumonia with a fungal etiology but we could not rule out a bacterial etiology. The white blood cell count was 5,800/mm3, and the segmented neutrophil portion was 76.4%. The C-reactive protein level was 0.86 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/dL) and there was no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism on chest CT.
We started empirical antibiotics with third generation cephalosporin and macrolide under the impression of community acquired pneumonia, but the follow-up chest CT at 1 week showed an increased extent of RUL patchy consolidation (, ). Furthermore, subjective symptoms of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain rapidly aggravated. No microorganisms were identified on the initial respiratory specimen culture. Findings from chest X-rays and chest CT suggested fungal pneumonia, however, the patient had not experienced severe neutropenia for several months, and there were no predisposing clinical factors favoring a diagnosis of fungal pneumonia. We considered the probability of lymphangitic metastatic carcinoma or a fungal infection such as aspergillosis or mucormycosis. Therefore, we performed a video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy for an accurate pathological diagnosis before administering antifungal agents. We thought it might be difficult to obtain a differential diagnosis using a percutaneous needle biopsy, because the nature of the lesion was infiltrative consolidation, not a mass.
We performed a wedge resection of the RUL. The specimen was 6×3×3 cm, and a gross examination of the sections showed focal brownish discoloration of lung parenchyma without definite evidence of necrosis, tumor, hemorrhage, or a calcified area. A microscopic examination showed metastatic carcinoma with extensive endolymphatic tumor emboli and hemorrhagic infarctions (, ). In contrast, Gram staining revealed no microorganisms and Gomori's methenamine silver and periodic-acid Schiff stains revealed no fungal hyphae. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction result was also negative.
We confirmed that the patient was not under infection, so we discontinued antimicrobial agents, enrolled the patient to the clinical trial and started first-line palliative chemotherapy consisting of ixabepilone (Ixempra™; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, USA) and capecitabine (Xeloda®; Roche, Basel, Switzerland), as the disease had relapsed just 4 months after neoadjuvant docetaxel and doxorubicin and during adjuvant CMF chemotherapy (). This study was supported by a grant of the Korean Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (A110448). After chemotherapy, the size of the consolidative lesion in the RUL and the extent of focal GGO in RUL and RLL decreased markedly. The pleuritic chest pain and DOE also improved.

The patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 97.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 5800.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 1.

102,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-6031942-1,Extracted,"We report the case of a 67-year-old male with kidney dysfunction. His past medical history included thyroidectomy due to hyperthyroidism at the age of 30 years. In 2006, the patient was admitted to our hospital for cerebral infarction, diabetes, hypertension, hyperuricemia, and dyslipidemia. Since that time, the patient had been prescribed the following medicines: levothyroxine sodium hydrate, 25 μg/day; amlodipine basilate OD, 5 mg/day; valsartan, 160 mg/day; feburostat, 10 mg/day; and atorvastatin calcium hydrate, 5 mg/day. Rapid types of insulin, such as the 16-unit Novo RapidN and the 10-unit Novolin RN had been used. The levels of uric acid are 4.90 mg/dL, and blood pressure was 140/70 mm Hg. The levels of FT3, FT4, TSH, and total cholesterol and triglyceride were within normal limits. An ophthalmologist diagnosed him with diabetic proliferative retinopathy and performed photocoagulation therapy. In November 2015, a serum urea nitrogen level of 56.0 mg/dL, a serum creatinine (s-Cr) level of 3.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 13.4 mL/min indicated renal dysfunction at another division.
Due to a recent increase in frothy urine, the patient was transferred to our nephrology division for a further treatment. At the time of the first visit to our division, body height was 160 cm and weight was 68 kg (BMI: 26.6). He showed slight obesity (obesity criteria in Japan: a BMI of more than 25.0). Laboratory data from the time of his first visit to our division in March 2016 showed a fasting plasma glucose level of 121 mg/dL and a HbA1c (national and glycohemoglobin standardization program: NGSP) of 6.9%. Thus, we moved him to a DPP-4 inhibitor, i.e., saxagliptin hydrate of 5 mg/day. High-density urine and a strongly positive proteinuria quantified at 2.62 g/gCr were found. Urine ketone bodies were negative, and there was a negative urine occult blood reaction, which resulted in a clinical diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy. The frothy (with small bubbles) urine meant that there was a high dose of protein in the urine. A serum urea nitrogen level of 60.7 mg/dL, a s-Cr level of 4.9 mg/dL, and an eGFR of 10.2 mL/min showed a progressive renal dysfunction. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies in sera were negative (normal value: < 1.5 U/mL).
In the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) classification, the causal disease, eGFR, and albuminuria (proteinuria) levels have to be determined. eGFR is divided into 5 stages, from GFR 1 to 5, and albuminuria (proteinuria) is divided into 3 stages, from A1 to 3, as shown in Figure . According to this classification, he was diagnosed as follows; chronic kidney disease (CKD); cause diabetes (type 2); GFR G5, (eGFR range: < 15 min/mL); and albuminuria, A3 (albuminuria range: > 300 mg/gCr). A definite diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy could not be made without renal biopsy. Kidney function, i.e., eGFR, was not improved by previous medications. We added on a minimal dosage of AST-120 (Kremezin®) of 2 g/day because of his severe constipation. After 3 months of AST-120 therapy, eGFR increased to 18.1 mL/min/1.73m2 (with a s-Cr of 2.90–2.72 mg/dL). Although he used some laxative products (senna 1 g/day and sennnoside 12 mg/day), he could not continue to take AST-120 and then completely stopped the drug 8 months after starting. Kidney function then abruptly declined (eGFR of 7.3 mL/min/1.73 m2; s-Cr of 6.7 mg/dL) and progressed to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), as shown in Figure . In June 2017, he was introduced to hemodialysis (HD).","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 67 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 4.9 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.6 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 26.562 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 26.6, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 62.992 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.992 (in inches) - 60) = 56.882 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 56.882 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 56.882 kg + 0.4 * (68.0 kg  - 56.882 kg) = 61.329 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 61.329 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 67) * 61.329 * 1) / (4.9 * 72) = 12.69 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 12.69 mL/min."

Incidentally found bilateral adrenal masses.
The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension 3 years prior, and had been receiving carvedilol 25 mg as prescribed by a private clinic. However, the patient's blood pressure (BP) had not been under control for about 3 months prior to the visit at our hospital. A year prior, the patient's menstrual cycle had become irregular and her weight had increased by 5 kg in the last year. The patient had visited our hospital due to the identification of bilateral adrenal masses from abdominal CT during a routine health examination.
Nothing specific except hypertension.
Nothing specific.
At the time of the visit to our hospital, the patient's height was 150 cm, weight was 53.8 kg, BP was 145/95 mm Hg, pulse rate was 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 times per minute, and body temperature was 37.1℃. She had an alert mental state, no visible signs for acute or chronic illness and no abnormal findings for skin, sclera and conjunctiva. Examination of the head and neck revealed a moon face, while a buffalo hump deformity was observed upon thoracic examination. There was no specific finding on the abdominal examination and no edema of extremities was identified. The patient had no accompanying muscle weakness or sensory deterioration.
The peripheral blood test performed at the time of visit to the hospital showed the following; white blood cell, 6,450/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 41.6%; and platelet, 289,000/mm3. The serum biochemical assay showed the following; calcium, 9.4 mg/dL; phosphorus, 3.3 mg/dL; total protein, 7.0 g/dL; albumin, 4.2 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 21 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 19 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase, 43 IU/L; blood urea nitrogen, 10 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dL; sodium, 144 mEq/L; potassium, 3.4 mEq/L; and chlorine, 102 mEq/L.
The hormone test indicated that the morning baseline blood cortisol was 15.7 µg/dL and ACTH was less than 5 pg/mL. The 24-hour urine free cortisol excretion increased to 198.7 µg/day (normal range, 23 to 135). In addition, the following were in the normal range; metanephrine, 63 µg/day (normal range, 52 to 341); normetanephrine, 176 µg/day (normal range, 88 to 444); epinephrine, 3.1 µg/day (normal range, 0 to 20); norepinephrine, 28.9 µg/day (normal range, 15 to 80); and vanillylmandelic acid, 5.4 mg/day (normal range, 0 to 8). The 24-hour urine creatinine was 0.5 g/day (normal range, 0.8 to 1.8) and the creatinine clearance was calculated to be 122.4 mL/min (normal range, 75 to 125), indicating that the urine sampling was done relatively well. The plasma aldosterone concentration was 7.5 ng/dL and plasma renin activity was 0.4 ng/mL/hr, indicating that the aldosterone/renin activity ratio was 18.7 and there was no finding of primary aldosteronism.
The serum cortisol after an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test was 14.5 µg/dL, which was not suppressed. The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test demonstrated that the 24-hour urine free cortisol excretion increased to 397.8 µg/day and the blood cortisol concentration increased to 21.1 µg/dL, so we diagnosed the patient's condition as Cushing Syndrome. In the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, the urine free cortisol excretion and blood cortisol concentration were not suppressed ().
Bilateral adrenal tumors were identified on adrenal CT, with one sized 2.8×2.0 cm on the right side and the others sized 2×2.3 cm and 1.7×1.4 cm, respectively, on the left side (). There were no abnormal findings from the Sella MRI.
Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) was done in order to identify the location of a functional tumor secreting cortisol in between the bilateral adrenal tumors. AVS was conducted without an ACTH stimulus on the day after the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The blood cortisol concentration was measured by sampling the blood twice from catheterization to the femoral vein and bilateral adrenal veins ().
When the bone density was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, osteopenia was found based on the finding that the T score of lumber spine was -2.1, T score of femoral neck was -1.0 and T score of the total hip was -0.7.
As the adrenal vein cortisol measured from AVS was eight times higher than that of the inferior vena cava, it was determined that the AVS was done selectively. The blood cortisol concentration was measured as high from the bilateral adrenal veins with AVS. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with Cushing Syndrome induced by bilateral cortisol-secreting adenomas. To treat the patient, we removed all of the bilateral adrenal tumors by laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy. Immediately after the surgery, the patient was discharged because there was no specific complication while implementing supplementary therapy with prednisolone and fludrocortisone, and we had discontinued the antihypertensive agent as the BP had improved to 120/80 mm Hg at the 2-month follow-up observation. At 5 months postoperatively, the blood cortisol concentration was 5.0 µg/dL, ACTH was 19.0 pg/mL, the plasma aldosterone concentration was 15.0 ng/dL, and the plasma renin activity was 3.0 ng/mL/hr, indicating no evidence of recurrence. The patient is currently under follow-up study as an outpatient while receiving prednisolone 5 to 2.5 mg and fludrocortisone 0.1 mg.
A single mass was found on each of the adrenal glands and their sizes were 2.6×2.3×1.7 cm for the left side mass and 2.6×2.5×1.6 cm for the right side mass. Based on the visual findings, the left mass was in the shape of a dumbbell with a narrowed mid-part, showing a light brown cross-section, and the right mass had a brown cross-section ().
From the optical microscopic findings, the bilateral adenomas were composed of large round vacuolar cells of consistent shape and size, and with good differentiation, whereas the normal tissues of the adrenal cortex around the adenoma were atrophic. As an atypical nucleus and necrosis, hemorrhage, or reverse differentiation were not found, the findings were appropriate for adrenal adenoma ().","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

488,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-5920258-1,Extracted,"A 44-year old female presented to our centre in late 2015 with bilateral lower limb pain and weakness following trivial trauma. She was known to have Type 1 renal tubular acidosis on regular follow-up with the nephrology unit since the age of 35. Prior to the admission, the patient was ambulating mostly independently with an occasional walking aid due to left hip pain. Unfortunately, a trivial fall landing in the sitting position following a vasovagal episode had rendered the patient immobile. On arrival at the emergency unit, she was conscious and alert. Though her vital signs were found to be normal, she appeared lethargic, albeit able to converse and give a full history. Clinically, systemic examination was unremarkable except for tenderness over both hip regions. Her main initial investigations suggested metabolic acidosis with a blood pH of 7.220 and bicarbonate of 14.4mmol/L. Total white blood count was elevated at 17 x 103 mmol/L. Renal profile revealed mild dehydration with a blood urea of 4.7 mmol/L and blood creatinine at 127 mmol/L, which was later corrected during her admission. Her potassium level was normal at 3.9mmol/L. She had hypocalcemia at 1.60mmo/l and hypophosphatemia at 0.59mmol/l. Albumin levels were normal at 35g/dl, but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was mildly elevated.
All investigations pointed towards poor control of her renal tubular acidosis leading to a systemic metabolic state with hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. The raised ALP was likely due to increased osteoblastic activity, a result of the osteomalacia. Further history taking revealed that the patient had not been compliant with the Shohl’s solution (mixture of citric acid and sodium citrate) which was prescribed by the nephrologist, claiming it to be distasteful. Further history revealed a previous fracture neck of left femur in 2010 which had been managed with internal fixation. Poor compliance to her RTA treatment was established after a thorough review. Despite suffering from a chronic renal disorder, the patient had no evidence of renal failure as the glomerular function was normal with no uremia. Therefore, we decided to distance the patient’s case from that of those with chronic renal failure with renal osteodystrophy.
Plain radiographs () revealed left intertrochanteric fracture with previous screw fixation for fracture of neck of left femur intact, with a contralateral right neck of femur fracture. While awaiting surgery, she was co-managed by a multi-speciality team which included the orthopaedic, nephrology and medical unit. Bilateral lower limb skin traction was applied till the day of surgery.
The bilateral proximal femoral fractures were treated surgically. A right total hip arthroplasty and left proximal femur nail (Synthes A2) fixation were performed in one setting. We performed a right total hip arthroplasty as the fracture involved an intracapsular component. As for the left sided extracapsular intertroncteric fracture, an intramedullary internal fixation was deemed best in view of the healed previous neck of femur fracture. The decision also was influenced by the need to provide primary stability in either limb to allow early rehabilitation, thus the decision for right total hip arthroplasty. The patient had an uneventful surgery and recovery and was discharged well with regular follow ups in the clinic to monitor progress with plain radiographs (). Awareness of the patient's current condition as well as emphasis over the importance of compliance were ensured to obtain good control of her RTA. At just over a year, patient had became independently ambulatory.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [44, 'years'], 'creatinine': [127.0, 'mmol/L'], 'sex': 'Female'}",0.012,0.011,0.013,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 44 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 127.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from mmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 127.0 mmol. To convert 127.0 mmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 127.0 mmol Serum Creatinine * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.127 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.127 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 14.366 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 14.366 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 14.366 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14366.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14366.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1436.6 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 127.0 mmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1436.6 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1436.6/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**44 * 1.012 = 0.012.
Hence, the GFR value is 0.012 ml/min/1.73 m²."

His past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease and chronic angina. His other active medical comorbidities include obstructive airway disease (OAD), hypertension, and benign prostate hypertrophy.
His drug therapy at home included carvedilol 3.125 mg twice a day, aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, torsemide 5 mg, ivabradine 5mg, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg, all once day. Digoxin 0.25 mg was prescribed once a day (5 days a week).
On arrival, he was febrile, pulse rate was 48/min (irregular), blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg with postural fall of 30 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 26/min. There were bilateral rhonchi and coarse crepitations in right interscapular region on chest auscultation. On neurological examination: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15/15, mini–mental state examination (MMSE) 26/30, frontal assessment battery (FAB) score 13/18 with no focal neurological deficit. Examination of the abdomen and cardiovascular system were unremarkable.
His initial investigations showed white blood cells 10,900/mm3, hemoglobin 13.7 mg/dL, platelets 169000/mm3, random blood sugar 182 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.16 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) showed mixed disorder metabolic and respiratory alkalosis with hypoxia: pH 7.5, PaCO2 31, PaO2 67, HCO3 26, and Po2/Fio2 2.4 on 28% Fio2 (Normal ABG values: pH 7.35–7.45, PaCO2 35-45 mm Hg, PaO2 80-100 mm Hg, HCO3 21-28 mEq/L). He had normal urine analysis, serum transaminases, serum electrolytes, troponin T, and thyroid function test. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed 1st degree atrioventricular block with multiple ventricular premature contractions. 2D transthoracic echocardiography showed 20% ejection fraction with regional wall motion abnormalities. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with right lower zone consolidation.
A diagnosis of acute exacerbation of OAD due to lobar pneumonia was made by chest physician and he was treated with antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactum, clarithromycin), and bronchodilators. Cardiologist was consulted for postural fall in blood pressure and ECG changes. On cardiologist advice, digoxin was omitted due to possibility of digoxin toxicity. Beta-blocker, ivabradine, diuretic, and nitrate were put on hold due to bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension. Ranolazine 500 mg twice/day was started as an antianginal agent.
During 48 hours after admission, his chest condition improved. The white blood cell count dropped to 7,300/mm3 and arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic alkalosis: pH 7.45, PaCO2 40, PaO2 94, HCO3 28, Po2/Fio2 3.3 on 28% Fio2. On day 3, the patient started developing mild confusion and visual hallucinations and by the day 7 of hospitalization, he developed dysarthria, dysmetria, and difficulty in ambulation due to ataxia. Neurological examination revealed GCS 15/15, MMSE 26/30, FAB 8/18 with no focal neurological deficit. Neurologist was consulted and magnetic resonance imaging with angiography was performed to rule out acute stroke. The imaging showed chronic small vessel ischemic changes with normal angiography. Cerebrospinal fluid examination and antithyroid antibodies test performed thereafter were within normal limits.
Keeping the possibility of drug-induced toxicity, recently added drug ranolazine was stopped. Within 2 days, his neurological signs and symptoms improved markedly and returned to baseline. The presumed correlation between the adverse reaction and the administration of ranolazine was not reinforced by rechallenge.

He showed cushingoid features including moon face, supraclavicular fat accumulation, buffalo hump, facial and truncal acne, ecchymoses and striae. Laboratory examination showed hypokalemia. The level of HbA1c was 5.4%. A 75-g OGTT showed normal glucose homeostasis. Z score at L1-L4 spine was 0.2. The serum levels of ACTH, cortisol, and 24-h urine free cortisol were markedly elevated (). Results of LDDST showed a cortisol value of 840.21 nmol/L after the dexamethasone administration. There was no suppression after HDDST. MRI of the pituitary gland did not showed signs of pituitary adenoma (). Just like case 1, ACTH max/ACTH basal was as high as 5.77 after desmopressin stimulation. BIPSS showed that there was no evidence of a central-to-peripheral gradient of ACTH at baseline or after desmopressin stimulation. According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with EAS. Thoracic CT scan was normal. Abdominal CT only showed nodular hyperplasia of the left adrenal gland (). The 18F-PET/CT showed increased uptake in both adrenal glands. Octreotide scanning also revealed negative results. As steroidogenesis inhibitors were unavailable, bilateral adrenalectomy was then performed via the same approach as case 1 without arterial variations. After surgery, a 20mg dose of hydrocortisone per day was added. Cushingoid features gradually disappeared. The levels of serum potassium remained normal without potassium supplement. Similarly, immunohistochemical staining showed focal positive ACTH staining in hyperplastic adrenal medulla cells (, ) and nodular hyperplasia of adrenal cortex in both adrenal glands (). ACTH level significantly decreased 3 months after surgery (). At the latest follow-up, a year after surgery, the patient complained about hyperpigmentation. Laboratory tests showed that 8AM ACTH level relapsed to 86.1 pmol/L. After LDDST, ACTH level significantly decreased to 18.4 pmol/L. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and pituitary MRI still showed no signs for lesions.

The physical examination revealed a cachectic young man with evident signs of ARF including tachypnea, breathy speech, and accessory muscle use. Chest auscultation evidenced fine inspiratory crackles, mainly in the right apex.

Laboratory admission tests showed Hb of 11.1 g/dL, white blood count (WBC) of 11.6 cells/μL, neutrophils count of 10.9/μL, lymphocytes count of 0.2/μL, Na+ of 136 mmol/L, Cl− of 98 mmol/L, K+ of 4.02 mmol/L, Ca2+ of 7.6 mg/dL, glucose of 77 mg/dL, Cr of 0.36 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 6.1 mg/dL, uric acid of 3.7 mg/dL, cholesterol of 91 mg/dL, triglycerides of 98 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.1 g/dL. The HIV and hepatitis B and C tests were all negative. Sputum acid-fast stains were positive since his previous hospitalization and a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay performed with another sputum sample confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. A chest X-ray showed diffuse alveolar and nodular opacities, as well an extensive right upper lobe cavitary disease (). Based on the above findings, we calculated an APACHE II score of 13. The patient was treated with hydrocortisone 100 to 250 mg intravenously for 8 hours, and a daily regimen of intravenous amikacin 750 mg, and moxifloxacin 400 mg, along with antituberculosis treatment of 3 tablets of a fixed-dose combination (DoTBal, SILANES Laboratories) of rifampicin 150 mg, isoniazid 75 mg, pyrazinamide 400 mg, and ethambutol 300 mg. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit but on day 4 in the hospital, the increased work of breathing required the initiation of NIPSV with a single-limb-circuit bilevel ventilator (VPAP III, ResMed) through an oronasal interface at pressures of 8–12/4 cm H2O. The DoTBal dose was increased to 4 tablets per day; however, the characteristic red color of the urine produced by rifampicin was no longer observed and the serum levels in a random sample were undetectable. Over the next 4 days despite slight improvement in PaCO2, it was not possible to wean the patient from NIPSV due to the persistent tachypnea. After a discussion regarding alternative therapies and under the respective observations of the local board of pharmacovigilance, the medical team decided as an extraordinary measure to administer etanercept (Enbrel, Wyeth Laboratories) 25 mg subcutaneously. The following day the patient showed a general improvement and an improved respiratory condition (). After 2 days, he could finally be separated from NIPSV and undergo continued care in an isolated hospital ward breathing supplemental oxygen via nasal prongs. Three days after the first dose of etanercept, a second dose was administered without significant changes in the clinical condition of the patient. However, 4 days after the second dose of etanercept, the patient experienced exacerbation of respiratory symptoms, malaise, and fever of 100.5°F (). Due to the short half-life of etanercept, this scenario was attributed to a paradoxical reaction and resolved promptly with the administration of a final third dose of etanercept along with hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenously. Within a few days, the clinical condition of the patient allowed his transfer to a unit with long-term care facilities, and after a month with negative smears for acid-fast bacilli he was finally discharged to their community under a directly observed therapy (DOT) program.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [98.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [2.1, 'g/dL'], 'Bicarbonate': [20.8, 'mEq/L'], 'Sodium': [136.0, 'mmol/L']}",9.95,9.452,10.447,"To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 20.8 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 20.8 mEq/L) = 17.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 17.2 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 2.1 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 17.2 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.1 (in g/dL)) = 21.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 21.95 mEq/L.
Plugging in 21.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 21.95 - 12 = 9.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 9.95 mEq/L."

The laboratory tests at the time of admission were worse in comparison the his sister, revealing more elevated levels of liver enzymes (AST 597 U/L, ALT 784 U/L), hyperbilirubinemia (TBi 4.192 mg/dL, DBi 3.747 mg/dL), hyponatremia (Na 133 mmol/L), hypopotassemia (K 3.2 mmol/L), hypoalbuminemia (Alb 2.55 mg/dL), and altered coagulation tests (APTT 73.1 seconds, INR 3.68). The abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly and ascites. After approximately 24 hours from admission, the hepatic cytolysis syndrome worsened (AST 1960 U/L, ALT 2544 U/L), and he was transferred to the PICU.
Similar to the case presented above, the little brother also received penicillin G by vein, glucose, electrolytes, and amino acids perfusion, and activated charcoal within the first hour after admission. Nevertheless, his condition continued to worsen and therapeutic plasma exchange along with the same supportive measures as in the case of his sister, were initiated in the PICU. Despite these therapeutic efforts, his liver enzymes continued to increase (AST 4386.7 U/L, ALT 5156.2 U/L) associating also renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.18 mg/dL).

On admission, she was 155 cm in height and 59.2 kg in weight and had temperature of 37.6°C, blood pressure of 118/64 mmHg, pulse rate of 71/min, respiration rate of 18/min, and SpO2 of 94% at room temperature. Physical examination revealed no specific findings. After admission, she developed herpangina-like aphthous ulcers at the palate, when significant monocytosis (absolute monocyte counts >5,000/μL) was first noted; however, monocytosis fluctuated (). Thereafter, a CT scan of the abdomen showed localized thickening of the intestinal wall () and colonofiberscopy (CF) revealed the presence of multiple ovoid punched-out ulcers at the terminal ileum and aphthous lesions at the ascending colon (). In addition, the patient also developed multiple erythematous rashes on her right thigh (). Given the diagnostic criteria of BD [], the rash was not typical erythema nodosum but was thought rather to be acneiform eruption. Ophthalmological studies showed no evidence of BD signs. Taken together, BD was suspected in this patient from fulfilling 2 major and 1 minor clinical features required in the diagnosis of BD []. Thereafter, from the second week of admission, the patient again developed a significant monocytosis (from 15% to >70% in PB, with absolute monocyte counts to a maximum of 23,900/μL) associated with urinary infection at the 5th week of admission (). These findings with subsequent bone marrow study confirmed a diagnosis of AMoL (Figures and ).
Blood results at the 5th week of admission, when AMoL was diagnosed, were as follows: white blood cells (33,200/μL) containing 15% blasts, 21% promonocytes, 19% mature monocytes, 1% myelocytes, 10% neutrophils, and 33% lymphocytes (). Flow cytometric data of a major cell population in PB were as follows: CD13+ (86.4%), CD14+ (80.0%), CD33+ (97.4%), CD34+ (0.8%), CD41+ (44.8%), CD56+ (32.4%), and HLA-DR+ (97.0%). Mature lymphocytes in PB consisted of mostly T cells (approximately 90%), whose markers were CD4+ (59.2%) and CD8+ (27.4%), respectively. By contrast, the hypercellular BM consisted of 33.2% blasts, 15.0% promonocytes, 33.6% mature monocytes, 6.8% granulocytes, 1.4% lymphocytes, 2.0% plasma cells, and 8.0% erythroblasts with an M/E ratio of 0.85 (). No significant abnormalities indicating MDS were noted. Flow cytometric results of the major cell population in BM were as follows: CD13+ (38.3%), CD14+ (26.0%), CD33+ (97.5%), CD41+ (45.5%), CD34+ (2.3%), CD56+ (38.0%), and HLADR+ (80.9%). Mature lymphocytes in BM were mostly T cells (approximately 90%) with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.54. Myeloperoxidase positive cells accounted for 10% of the mononuclear cells present in both the PB and BM, while alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (inhibited by sodium fluoride) positive cells comprised more than 60% of cells in both the PB and BM. These findings were compatible with the diagnostic criteria of AMoL (FAB M5b) []. In addition, the karyotypes of PB and BM cells were both 46, XX [20/20]. The other blood chemistry was uneventful except for high levels of CRP (15.75 mg/dL), with aspartate aminotransferase 13 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 14 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 205 U/L, total bilirubin 0.76 mg/dL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 2.9 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 23.4 mg/dL, creatinine 1.61 mg/dL, sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.6 mmol/L, chlorine 97 mmol/L, and calcium 8.0 mg/dL.
Since the diagnosis of AMoL (FAB M5b) was confirmed, the biopsied tissues showing BD-like illness were reevaluated with immunostaining except for stomatitis lesions and were proved to have leukemic cell infiltrations. The intestinal ulcer-associated granulation tissues with vascularization and infiltration of cells were positive for lysozyme, CD13, CD14, and CD33 (Figures and ). Also the histopathology of skin rash showed that the infiltrating cells were positive for lysozyme, CD13, CD14, and CD33 (Figures and ). These findings confirmed that the lesions primarily thought due to BD-like illness were in fact AMoL-related. In addition, HLA-typing, performed to ascertain whether the patient had BD-related HLA types, detected the presence of A2/A24 and B52/B55 but not the BD-related HLA-B51 or B5 alleles [, ]. As shown in , the patient was initially treated with adalimumab for BD-like illness, following the successful report for a case of intestinal BD with trisomy 8 MDS by Kimura et al. []; however, after AMoL was confirmed, she was transferred to another hospital for intensive chemotherapy as a very high-risk patient.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [74, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.61, 'mg/dL'], 'Race': 'Asian'}",31.283,29.719,32.847,"The patient is 74 years old.

Patient had a multi-week history of diarrhea that was waking him up at night leading up to the C. diff diagnosis. One week prior to ED admission, his GI had ordered precautionary leukocytes and C. diff due to history of UC, and both returned positive. Per GI note, ""Vancomycin prescribed as this patient has IBD and patients with IBD can develop spontaneous C. diff infections and need to be treated regardless of toxin presence."" He had no prior history of antibiotic use over the past three months or triggering factor for C. diff infection.
Over the course of the week, his symptoms progressed, and he claimed to have nausea, vomiting, and hematochezia.
The patient presented with a past medical history of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. His allergies included trazodone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. His family history was unrevealing. His surgical history included cholecystectomy and thyroglossal duct cyst removal in 2019.
This patient was a nonsmoker. He denied alcohol or drug use. He tried to maintain a healthy diet of lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables.
Initial vitals on presentation included: temperature: 98.6 F, pulse: 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute, pulse oximetry: 95%, blood pressure: 119/87 mmHg, weight: 217.16 lbs, and body mass index: 32.14.
General surgery was consulted upon CT scan with IV contrast revealing new extraluminal gas in the perineum surrounding the anus and distal rectum (Figures , , , ). He was examined and subsequently diagnosed with rectal perforation.
Preoperatively, the patient’s physical exam revealed an uncomfortable looking young man in mild distress due to abdominal pain. An abdominal exam revealed no distention, masses, rebound, or guarding. The absence of McBurney’s sign, Murphy’s sign, and peritoneal inflammation was noted. There was no active rectal bleeding at the time of physical examination. Laboratory data revealed an elevated c-reactive protein of 66.4. Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were otherwise within normal limits. Despite infection and imaging reflecting perforation, white blood count was found to be 5.9 k/cmm.
After review of the available data, assessment of clinical condition, and deliberation with the emergency department physicians and the patient’s primary gastroenterology physician, the surgery team decided the patient would require an urgent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy due to the diagnosis of rectal perforation secondary to C. diff colitis on chronic UC.
The patient was immediately brought to the operating room. The primary incision was made from the subxiphoid to the pubic symphysis within two hours of initial presentation to the hospital. The colon was visualized and resected; thus, a total colectomy was undergone. The pre-rectal space was opened to identify signs of purulence or injury, which found crepitus and severe UC causing circumferential ulcerations and a deep ulcer in the midline anteriorly. These ulcers traversed all layers of the rectal wall. A drain was placed to drain potential abscess or infection from the pre-rectal space.
The patient left the OR in stable condition after enduring no complications intraoperatively. He remained in the inpatient surgical unit for five days, during which he continued to advance his diet and ambulate successfully. He was discharged after an education session on ostomy bag maintenance and told to follow up with the general surgery team and gastroenterology team in one week. At his one-week follow-up post-op visit, the patient was doing well, ostomy output was draining appropriately, and he denied fever, nausea, or vomiting. No secondary follow-up surgery was required.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [98.6, 'degrees fahreinheit'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [90.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [15.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [5900.0, 'µL']}",2,2,2,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 98.6 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 66.6 = 37.0 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 90.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 5900.0 count/µL. To convert 5900.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 5900.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 5900000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 15.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2."

She was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 12 and has a significant family history for Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Her medical history is significant for T2DM complicated by microalbuminuria, depression, and type IV hyperlipidemia. She was referred to the practice for management of T2DM at the age of 14 with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 11.47. Her HbA1c has not been below 11% in the past 2 years, including an A1C of 13.4% in July 2012.
In September 2012, the patient presented with her mother for a follow-up visit. The patient stated she tries to control her blood sugar and weight but gets frustrated and reverts to poor habits. Her parents are not helpful in assisting her in managing her medical problems or establishing healthy eating habits. Her weight at this visit was 244 lbs. With a height of 66 inches; her BMI was 39.4 kg/m2. Prior to this visit, she managed her diabetes with insulin glargine 75 units subcutaneously in the morning and 25 units at night, metformin ER 2000 mg once daily, and insulin aspart at mealtime using a coverage scale, as the patient and parents were reluctant to use scheduled mealtime insulin doses. Her HbA1c was 11.19% at this visit. After careful consideration and dutiful explanation to the patient and her mother (including the fact that no other medication is currently approved for use in pediatric patients), consent was given, and liraglutide 0.6 mg subcutaneously daily was added to the patient's diabetes regimen. The patient was instructed to titrate the dose of liraglutide up to 1.8 mg daily over a three-week period.
On October 26th, 2012, the patient returned to the office for a 1-month follow-up visit since the initiation of liraglutide; she was currently using 1.8 mg subcutaneously daily. She reported no adverse effects from the medication and no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. During this time her HbA1c decreased by 1.53% to 9.66%. In addition, her total daily basal insulin requirement decreased 20% from baseline and she rarely needed insulin aspart for mealtime coverage of glucose excursions. Weight was 11 pounds higher than at her previous visit. Nutritional counseling was again addressed. On November 27th, 2012, the patient returned to the office for a follow-up visit two months after initiation of liraglutide. The patient stated that she has not experienced any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Her HbA1c decreased an additional 0.82% to 8.84%, representing a total A1C reduction of 2.35%. The patient's diabetes regimen included liraglutide 1.8 mg subcutaneously prior to dinner, insulin glargine 60 units subcutaneously at bedtime, and metformin ER 2000 mg with the evening meal. Since the initiation of liraglutide the patient's basal insulin requirement has decreased by 40%, and she no longer requires the use of mealtime insulin.

There is no other family history of Marfan disease, aortic disease, or sudden death.
The pregnancy was planned. Anomaly scans at 33 weeks showed increased leg length, and repeat scans at 37 weeks demonstrated oligohydramnios. This resulted in steroid induction at 37 + 2 weeks. After birth, she did not require any resuscitation or special care but was found to have positional talipes. At birth, her length was 49.6 cm (>75th centile) and head circumference 33 cm (50th centile). Her birth weight was 2.335 kg (9th centile).
She was referred to a genetics clinic at 6 weeks due to concern over her physical features. On examination, her head circumference was 39 cm (99.6th centile) and length was 55 cm (75th–91st centile). Her head was plagiocephalic with prominent coronal sutures and a posteriorly positioned anterior fontanelle, and her posterior skull was turricephalic with a cone shape (see ). Her zygomatic arches were prominent.
Her fingers and toes appeared elongated (arachnodactyly), although lengths were not objectively measured, and her thumb held abducted (see ). She had clicky joints in her legs and was unable to fully extend her knees. Her feet bent up so that the top of her foot touched her shin. She had kyphoscoliosis.
There was presence of a divergent squint, although eye exam was otherwise unremarkable, with no lenticular dislocation nor iridodonesis noted. Her palate was normal. Her right nipple was positioned more laterally compared to the left and her ribs were more prominent on the right. The remainder of the clinical examination was unremarkable.
In light of the dysmorphic features identified, genetic investigations were carried out on suspicion of nMFS. There was confirmation of an FBN1 gene mutation (exon 26, c.3143T>C). Echocardiography was performed which showed aortic root dilatation at 5 months of age, with a maximum diameter of 18 mm (Z + 4.3). In addition, echocardiography demonstrated atrioventricular valve prolapse, tricuspid regurgitation, a dysplastic mitral valve with mitral regurgitation, an increase in right ventricular pressure, and pulmonary hypertension (see ).
At 5 months of age, she was admitted due to signs of heart failure and respiratory distress, with a click and pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation on cardiac auscultation. She was started on medical heart failure therapy (captopril, spironolactone, and furosemide) and was discharged home following improvement. The child was started on captopril (an ACE inhibitor) instead of an alternative angiotensin receptor blocker, as this was consistent with local trust guidelines.
Worsening respiratory function at 7 months required further admission to rule out bronchiolitis and pneumonia, although no formal lung function tests were carried out. Our patient was commenced on sildenafil in light of the clinical picture and previous echocardiographic demonstration of pulmonary hypertension.
Echocardiogram revealed worsening regurgitation, dilated pulmonary arteries, and pulmonary hypertension and a CT scan additionally demonstrated right sided cardiac enlargement, an atrial septal defect, and a patent ductus arteriosus (see ). At 8 months of age she required intubation and mechanical ventilation for further deteriorations. Our patient was started on the phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor milrinone, and captopril was converted to irbesartan on the advice of the intensive care unit. Since then, she remained on mechanical ventilation due to a combination of cardiac failure and a restrictive lung physiology related to scoliosis and severe hypotonia. Digoxin was started one month later due to persistent cardiac failure.
A multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting discussed the feasibility of cardiac surgery given the severity of congestive cardiac failure, and it was concluded that surgery would not be in the patient's best interests. The nMFS presentation, severe hypotonia, and its impact on early and late postoperative morbidity were the main concern, with the comorbidities preventing a good long-term outcome.
A second opinion concerning cardiac surgery was requested by the parents. A clinical geneticist's view was sought and they emphasised that the main prognosis for this child was dependent upon her life limiting cardiovascular status and that disease related complications would be manageable after surgery and compatible with a good quality of life. Consequently, it was decided that cardiac surgery would be in the patient's best interests. It is important to note that this view was subjective but discussed and agreed on by an MDT including cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons. In preparation for surgery, and in light of worsening cardiovascular and respiratory function, the patient was given a tracheostomy to facilitate long-term ventilation.
The patient underwent tricuspid valve repair (leaflet repair and partial annuloplasty), mitral valve repair (leaflet chordae shortening and partial annuloplasty), and ASD closure at 11 months of age. Direct inspection of her lungs showed very significant pulmonary emphysema. The surgery was uneventful with no bleeding and no rhythm issues apart from slow sinus rhythm. She was admitted to PICU in a stable condition. Nasogastric feeding was resumed 2 days after surgery.
From a cardiovascular point of view, the patient remained stable following the surgery. She required inotropic support with adrenaline for 2 hours and required pacing via epicardial pacemaker for 24 hours due to slow sinus rhythm. A postoperative transthoracic echo in PICU confirmed good surgical results with good biventricular function, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation (see ).
Following surgery, the patient remains ventilated through a tracheostomy but has had gradually increasing periods off ventilator (30 minutes–1 hour every 2-3 hours). She developed frequent daily vomiting due to gastrooesophageal reflux disease, which was treated with omeprazole. Due to feeding difficulties, a PEG was inserted. Since then she has been progressing well and is gaining weight. Immediately before operation, at 11 months of age, the patient weighed 5.80 kg (<0.4th centile). At 14 months of age she weighed 8 kg (2nd–9th centile).","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [8.0, 'kg']}",32.0,30.4,33.6,"The patient's weight is 8.0 kg.

The patient was also showed negative results for the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). The patient’s angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was normal. No bilateral hilar adenopathy or infiltration was detected on a chest radiograph. No uveitis was detected in an ophthalmic examination. Abdominal echography showed that the right and left kidneys were 10.7 × 4.8 cm and 10.6 × 5.3 cm in size, respectively.
A renal biopsy obtained 53 glomeruli, 30 of which showed global sclerosis and 11 of which were collapsed without glomerular lesions. Immunofluorescence staining of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, and fibrinogen was negative. Tubulointerstitial injury with the interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes was observed in 90% of the total area, and there were some non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas with Langhans giant cells (Fig. ). Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry was performed with the T-cell marker CD3 and B-cell markers CD5, CD20, and CD23 (Fig. ). The interstitial area was strongly positive for CD5 and CD20, positive for CD3 and weakly positive for CD23. The area inside or in the vicinity of the epithelioid cell granulomas was positive for CD3 and CD5 and negative for CD20 and CD23.
We determined that progressive renal dysfunction had occurred due to the diffuse infiltration of CLL cells in the interstitial area of the kidneys, and the patient was treated with two cycles of cyclophosphamide. The treatment was unable to attenuate the progression of the renal dysfunction, and the patient ultimately required maintenance hemodialysis due to end-stage renal failure.",What is the patient's body surface area?

One month before, she described a similar swelling of her right lower extremity that lasted for about 1 week which spontaneously improved. She has one child of 4 years of age and has been taking oral contraceptive pills for 2 years. She had a history of thrombocytopenia of which cause has not yet been determined. She has no known underlying cancer. She has no history of miscarriage. Upon admission, she was fully conscious and alert. Her weight and height were 96 kg and 170 cm, respectively. Her initial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature were 112/82 mmHg, 108 bpm, 20 bpm, and 37.9 c, respectively. She had swelling of both lower extremities more pronounced on the left side. After an initial assessment, color Doppler ultrasonography was done and revealed acute deep venous thrombosis. She was positive for lupus anticoagulant which suggested that antiphospholipid syndrome was the cause of her extensive thrombosis. Further, CT venography revealed partial thrombosis of the entire inferior vena cava (IVC) down to the common and external iliac veins and common femoral veins []. A ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy was requested to evaluate for pulmonary embolism. Imaging was carried out with Vertex V60 EPIC HP Gamma Camera System (ADAC Laboratories, USA) using a LEGP collimator. For the ventilation study, the patient inhaled 20 mCi of Tc-99m diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid aerosol and 6-view images of the lungs were obtained for 300 k counts per view. Immediately after the ventilation study, the lower extremity ascending RNV was done by injecting 3 mCi of Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin intravenously at the superficial vein of each feet with elastic bandages tied around both ankles. Anterior and posterior scintigraphic imaging started at the ankle level with the gamma camera moving proximally up to the upper abdomen at a speed of 20 cm/min. Then, immediately after the venogram was acquired, the 6-view perfusion lung images were obtained for 1200 k counts. A postexercise scan of the lower extremities was also done after the patient performed alternate leg raising for about 15 min during the time the perfusion lung scintigraphy was being acquired. The RNV revealed the absence of radiotracer activity in the deep venous system of bilateral lower extremities with the radiopharmaceutical shunting into numerous superficial collateral veins at the calves, thighs, pelvis, and the anterior abdominal wall. There was diminished radiopharmaceutical activity in the IVC with shunting into the paravertebral veins.[] The postexercise scan revealed that there was retention of the radiopharmaceutical in both calves and faintly along the deep veins of the thighs and the iliac veins. These findings mirror that of the contrast-enhanced CT which indicate extensive thrombosis in the deep veins of both lower extremities up to the iliac veins and the IVC []. Upon examination of the lung scintigraphy, a large mismatched perfusion defect at the left lower lobe was seen which suggested pulmonary embolism. It was noticed that there is radiopharmaceutical activity accumulation in the upper abdomen which was seen in only the perfusion scan but not in the ventilation scan []. A SPECT/CT of the lung and upper abdomen was performed to better characterize these lesions and revealed that there was increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in segment 4 of the liver or the quadrate lobe []. The SPECT/CT of the lung also more clearly revealed the perfusion defect at the superior and basal segments of the left lung with no corresponding opacity on the CT image, which further consolidates the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (image not shown).",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [108.0, 'bpm'], 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': True, 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': True, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': True}",9.0,9.0,9.0,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

6706,48,PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism,diagnosis,integer,pmc-4673375-1,Extracted,"A 57-year-old Caucasian male was brought to our emergency department (ED) following an allergic reaction (flushing, chest rash, and drop in blood pressure [BP] to 90/60 mm Hg) to intravenous (i.v.) amiodarone administered by the emergency medical service (EMS) to treat atrial fibrillation. Upon admission, he was anxious and complained of palpitations. He had a history of palpitations and experienced several episodes of irregular heart rhythm following lack of sleep, or periods of work-related stress. He had arterial hypertension for 2 years, and was regularly taking his prescribed medication (5 mg ramipril and 5 mg amlodipine). In his family history, there were no serious diseases and cardiovascular emergencies. His palpitations started 6 hours before presenting to the EMS. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at the EMS showed AF with fast ventricular response (125 bpm). Blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg and physical examination showed no abnormalities other than irregular heart rhythm on auscultation. He was administered 300 mg amiodarone in 250 mL 5% dextrose solution, and in a matter of minutes had a drop in BP, a rash appeared on his chest, and he complained of flushing. Amiodarone was stopped, and 150 mg propafenone in 250 mL 5% dextrose solution i.v. was admistered as an alternative. This attempt at cardioversion was unsuccessful, and he was transferred to our ED.
Upon arrival to our ED he was agitated and complained of palpitations. His physical examination findings were unremarkable other than irregular heart rhythm on heart auscultation.
His BP was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse above 125 bpm, pulse oximeter showed 98% oxygenation. His body mass index was 29.2 kg/m2, body temperature 36.7°C. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular response of 107 bpm. He had left electrical axis and left anterior fascicular block. There were no signs of accessory electrical conduction pathway in ECG. There were no radiological or clinical signs of cardiac decompensation, and we ruled out acute coronary or pulmoembolic syndrome. We performed both transtoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, which showed structurally normal heart with normal heart cavities and good systolic function of the left ventricle, with no visible thrombus. He was on telemetry monitoring during the index hospitalization. After having ruled out immediate and life-threatening causes, such as cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism, other possible causes of paroxysmal AF were considered. The common causes of atrial fibrillation are well known, and diagnostic tests revealed no underlying structural heart disease. Thyrotoxicosis was excluded and there were no electrolyte disorders.
According to AF treatment guidelines and patient workup results, we decided for rhythm-control strategy rather than rate-control strategy since paroxysmal FA lasted less than 48 hours. Propafenone was prescribed in an oral dose of 150 mg twice a day, bisoprolol 2.5 mg in the morning, and standard thromboprophylaxis with nadroparine 0.8 ml subcutaneously once a day. A betablocator was excluded from therapy due to AF with bradycardic ventricular response (<60 bpm), and a drop of arterial BP to 105/75 mm Hg. He was very anxious and experienced palpitations, therefore we decided to treat him with acupuncture before performing a transesophageal ultrasound. He was scheduled for electrocardioversion for the upcoming day. Acupuncture was administered by a physician accredited at the Croatian Society for Acupuncture, a member of the International Council of Medical Acupuncture and Related Techniques. He was stimulated bilaterally with acupuncture needles (Tewa coated needle PB 2540, 0.25 × 40 mm) at 3 acupuncture points (HT-7, ST-36 and PC-6). Manual stimulation of the acupuncture point was performed until “De-Qui” effect (sensation of numbness, distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site) was produced, and then needles were left for 25 minutes. There was an instant drop of ventricular response rate during treatment and 2 hours after acupuncture therapy cardioversion to sinus rhythm occurred. There was no significant drop of arterial BP during or after acupuncture therapy. He received additional ambulatory acupuncture therapy during 10 treatments every third day in addition to propafenone at peroral dose of 300 mg twice a day. No anticoagulation was recommended due to CHA2DS2-VASC score of zero (0). He was urged to minimize work-related stress and keep a diary of his symptoms.
Twenty-four-hour Holter ECG performed after one month showed sinus rhythm with median frequency of 72/min. At 3 month follow-up examination, ECG showed sinus rhythm.

In 1990, she underwent a left quadrantectomy with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenectomy followed by local radiotherapy and chemotherapy for ductal breast cancer.
As in the previous case, we made a hepatic evaluation before the surgery. This revealed hepatic cirrhosis with multifactorial aetiology: dysmetabolism (diabetes poorly controlled for years, overweight) and toxic alcohol-induced (previous abuse, now notably reduced) and a possible minor iatrogenic component (post quadrantectomy chemotherapy in 1990). The patient had a minimal hepatic cytolysis in progress with moderate increase in indicators of cholestasis. To further complicate the situation, we observed signs of compromised hepatic function (Child Pugh class A6), portal hypertension with thrombocytopenia and diffused esophageal varices.
We did not find any contraindication to surgery, but underlined a risk of clinical decompensation and a hepatic functional risk in the post-surgical setting (surgical stress, anesthesiological toxicity...).

Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.","{'Albumin': [3.6, 'mg/dL'], 'Calcium': [7.0, 'mEq/L']}",19.197,18.237,20.157,"To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL).
The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of Albmumin is 3.6 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Albmumin from mg to g. The mass of Albmumin is 3.6 mg. To convert 3.6 mg of Albmumin to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.6 mg Albmumin * 0.001 g/mg = 0.004 g Albmumin. The volume units is dL so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 3.6 mg Albmumin/dL converts to 0.004 g Albmumin/dL. 
The concentration of Calcium is 7.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mEq to mg. The mass of Calcium is 7.0 mEq. To convert from 7.0 mEq to mg mmol, first convert from mEq to mmol. The compound, Calcium, has a valence of 2, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 7.0 mEq/(2 mEq/mmol) = 3.5 mmol Calcium. To convert 3.5 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.5 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol Calcium. The mass of Calcium is 0.004 mol. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.16 g Calcium. To convert 0.16 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.16 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 160.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 160.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 16.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 7.0 mEq Calcium/L converts to 16.0 mg Calcium/dL. 
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 0.004 g/dL)) + 16.0 mg/dL = 19.197 mg/dL.
The patient's corrected calcium concentration 19.197 mg/dL."

Abdominal examination revealed that the abdominal region was leveled and soft without any pressure or pain, and no palpable masses or superficial lymph nodes were observed. Hematological tests showed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.8 g/dL, indicating anemia, and no abnormalities were indicated by CEA, CA19-9, and AFP tumor markers were observed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor-like mass with delle and bridging fold in the greater curvature of the lower stomach, and the tumor was suspected as the cause of anemia (Fig. ). Ultrasound endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT) (with the fourth layer as the main locus) and a tumor (with the third layer as the main locus), with some areas of indistinct borders (Fig. b). Tissue biopsy of this tumor indicated group 5 tubular adenocarcinoma, and thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor with a mottled contrast stain in the stomach body and no regional lymph nodes or distant metastases (Fig. ). Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with collision tumor of gastric cancer and SMT (GIST was highly suspected). Gastrectomy was performed via laparotomy, and the surgical findings were a diagnosis of H0P0CY0 according to the 3rd English edition of the latest edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma issued by the Japan Gastric Cancer Society []. Distal gastrectomy was performed with D2 lymph node dissection according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines [].
The tumor was located in the greater curvature of the antrum of the stomach and measured 50 × 45 mm in size (Fig. a). On the cut surface, a nodular tumor was mainly observed in the submucosal layer, and the mucosal surface was ulcerated (Fig. b). A large part of the tumor was observed to be mixed and some of the cancer parts and GIST alone sites were observed. (Fig. c). The nodular tumor was characterized by the intermingled proliferation of carcinoma cells and spindle cells (Fig. d). The spindle cells formed a nodular tumor in the submucosal layer and the subserosal layer. Carcinoma cells invaded the nodular tumor of the spindle cells. Pathological examination revealed Ki67 positive cells comprised 2% of the GIST. The average mitotic count was ≤ 5 mitotic figures per 50 high power fields. GIST was classified as very low risk according to the guidelines for GIST risk stratification []. Tubular adenocarcinoma had reached the subserosa, and no lymph node metastases were observed. The pathological findings were a diagnosis of pT3N0M0 pStageIIA, according to the 3rd English edition of the latest edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma issued by the Japan Gastric Cancer Society []. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a positive reaction for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) in the carcinoma cells (Fig. a). Further, the nuclei of adenocarcinoma cells were positive for TP53 (Fig. b). Although the spindle cells were negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and TP53, these cells were positive for c-kit (Fig. c), weakly positive for DOG-1, and negative for desmin and S-100. As a result, the tumor was diagnosed as a collision tumor of GIST and adenocarcinoma. Lymph node metastasis of GIST or adenocarcinoma was not observed, and the resected margins were negative for neoplastic cells. Histologically, the intratumoral GIST sections contained different KIT exon 17 mutations, and KIT exon 17 mutation corresponding to amino acid substitution Asp820Lys was observed. On the other hand, the adenocarcinoma section detected no KIT mutation.
No complications were observed postoperatively, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 14. No adjuvant therapy was required for GIST, as per the international guidelines for GIST risk stratification [].

The patient’s medical and family history did not include any specific characteristic. Her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, and pulse was 85 (min) at presentation. Laboratory analysis did not indicate any significant pathology. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed an abdominal mass of mesenteric origin sized 6.7*6*5.5 cm, with intense contrast uptake in the mesenterium in the lower abdominal quadrant. The patient had no additional morbidity, and a decision was made for surgery. Intra-abdominal exploration revealed a mass with regular margins, localized at the mesenteric root at approximately 50 cm proximal of the terminal ileum. The mesenteric mass was resected together with segmentary small intestine resection (Figure ).
Histopathological investigation of the mass revealed a giant granulomatous structure that consisted of plasma cells. In light of this information, the patient was screened for potential granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. The patient was diagnosed with Castleman disease, as she was found to be negative for granulomatous diseases (Figure ).

She was previously diagnosed as type 2 DM in 1996, and recently started insulin treatment to improve glycemic control due to persistently elevated HbA1c irrespective of oral administration of hypoglycemic agents. Three years before, she had taken propylthiouracil for hyperthyroid Graves' disease for 2 yr. In May 2003, she was diagnosed as relapse of hyperthyroidism at a local clinic and referred to our hospital for management of thyrotoxicosis refractory to usual dosage of propylthiouracil, 300 mg/day and proliferative diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. She had 7.9 mM/L fasting blood glucose, 1.07 nM/L C-peptide (reference range [RR], 0.1-0.83), 222 mM/L fructosamine (RR, 205-285), 8.3% HbA1c (RR, 4.5-5.6) and 0.01 mU/L TSH and 2.02 pM/L free T3 on thryoid function tests. At that time, Her weight was 54 kg and height was 147 cm (body mass index, 25.0 kg/m2). Her thyroid had the volume of about 40 g and it looked diffusely enlarged and rubbery consistency on palpation. The technetium-99m (Tc-99m) thyroid scan revealed marginally increased and somewhat irregular uptake (3.8%). As from hospitalization, the patient had oral administration of relatively high dose of methimazole (60 mg daily), propranolol (160 mg daily) and 12 drops of Lugol's solution (three times a day) for 14 days, and consecutively lithium carbonate (900 mg daily) for 14 days because of persisting tachycardia (>110/ min), dyspnea on exertion and still high concentration of free T3 (4.44 pM/L). She was discharged with receiving methimazole (60 mg daily) and beta-blocker ().
She had no family history of thyroid disease, but both parents have been suffering from type 2 DM. She denied ingestion of any drugs including alcohol or excessive consumption of fizzy drinks these days. She also has been adhering to administration of antithyroid drug, beta-blocker and insulin (0.5 units/kg/day) since being discharged. On physical examination, the patient had 143/89 mmHg blood pressure, 36.8℃ body temperature, 22/min respiration rate, and 121/min pulse rate. She looked acutely ill, and had slightly tremulous, warmhands, and decreased skin turgor and dried tongue. She was 48 kg weight and body mass index 22.2 kg/m2. Exophthalmos was not present. The abdomen was soft and flat, and liver and spleen were not palpable.
On admission, her laboratory findings were as follows; hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, WBC 8.65×109/L (segmented neutrophil 58%, lymphocyte 29%), platelet 398×109/L, total protein 65 g/L, albumin 32 g/L, ALP 3.47 ukat/L, AST 0.42 ukat/L, ALT 0.6 ukat/L, BUN 9.2 mM/L and creatinine 88.7 µM/L. Levels of blood glucose (32.7 mM/L) and fructosamine (396 mM/L) were elevated. Her serum electrolytes and blood gas parameters were as follows: sodium 144.1 mM/L, potassium 5.4 mM/L, chloride 102 mM/L, calcium 2.5 mM/L, phosphorus 1.0 mM/L, pH 7.32, pCO2 35 mmHg, pO2 98 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 mM/L. The fasting serum C-peptide was 0.44 nM/L. Serum anion gap was 20.9 and osmolarity was calculated as 321 mosm/kg. Amylase and lipase levels were normal and anti-GAD antibody was negative. Thyroid function tests revealed that the patient had more aggravated hyperthyroid state; 0.01 mU/L TSH, 2.78 pM/L free T3 and 45.38 pM/L free T4 (RR, 11.41-23.08) than when she was hospitalized two weeks before (0.12 mU/L TSH, 1.41 pM/L free T3 and 30.26 pM/L free T4). TSH-receptor antibody level was 26.3 IU/L (RR, <1) and antimicrosomal antibody was 29.3 U/mL (RR, <60). The Tc-99m scan showed still enlarged thyroid with more increased uptake 6.5% than previous uptake scan (3.8%) performed taking propylthiouracil two months before. Based on above results, the patient was diagnosed as HHS accompanying mild ketosis on type 2 DM and aggravated Graves' hyperthyroidism. We treated her with intravenous insulin injection and large volume of intravenous fluid administration. And also, she took high dose of methimazole (90 mg daily, six times a day) and beta-blockers. On the second day, nausea and generalized weakness have been improved.
At two months after acute presentation, we measured levels of C-peptide after 75 g glucose loading; 0 min (0.12 nM/L), 30 min (0.74 nM/L), 60 min (1.02 nM/L), 90 min (1.49 nM/L) and 120 min (1.32 nML). Throughout follow-ups for 2 months, she took insulin (0.9 units/kg/day), metformin (1,500 mg daily) and methimazole (45 mg daily).

Her past medical history was unremarkable, and her preoperative investigations including coagulation profile were within normal limits. Before induction of general anesthesia, an epidural catheter was inserted uneventfully at T7–T8 intervertebral level using 16G Tuohy needle. Epidural space was identified using loss of resistance to saline, with no blood seen through epidural needle and the catheter. Postoperative analgesia was provided with continuous epidural infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine along with 2 mcg/ml of fentanyl at the rate of 5 ml/h. Pneumatic calf pump was started preoperatively and continued in the postoperative period to prevent thromboembolism. On the 3rd postoperative day, epidural catheter was removed after confirming normal coagulation parameters. For deep vein thromboprophylaxis, a single dose of fractionated heparin (dalteparin 2500 U) was given subcutaneously 6 h after the removal of epidural catheter according to the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) guidelines.
Six hours after the first dose of dalteparin, the patient complained of severe back pain along with loss of sensory and motor power in the lower limbs. Clinical examination revealed no sensations and muscle power of grade 0/5 in both the lower limbs.
With high index of suspicion of spinal/epidural hematoma causing spinal cord compression, the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone infusion, and further dosage of dalteparin sodium was withheld.
Within 2 h of onset of symptoms, an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained which revealed a localized epidural hematoma posteriorly from D6 to D8 level causing compression and significant anterior displacement of adjacent spinal cord [].

He weighed 72.5 kg and was 1.78 m tall. Flexible sigmoidoscopy to the mid-sigmoid colon demonstrated granular mucosa with loss of the vascular pattern and bleeding into the mucosa. Rectal biopsies were taken. He was commenced on 4 g of Mesalazine enema per rectum nightly. He was reviewed two weeks later but remained symptomatic and oral mesalazine 1.2 g three times daily was initiated at this time.
He re-presented 4 days later with a significant clinical deterioration. He was febrile with frequent rigors, lethargic, complaining of palpitations and sinusitis. He was passing 8-10 stools per day with a significant amount of blood and mucus per rectum. He was on no other medications aside from the oral mesalazine.
His past medical history consisted of reflux as a child. He had no known food or drug allergies. His family history was significant for a maternal aunt with known colitis, a maternal uncle with ulcerative colitis and a mother with coeliac disease. He was a lifelong non-smoker and drank on average 15 units of alcohol per week.
On examination his temperature was 38.4°C, he was tachycardic, rigoring frequently and looked generally unwell.
He had routine blood tests and blood cultures carried out. He was subsequently admitted. He was commenced on IV co-amoxiclav and IV metronidazole. Stool cultures were sent for culture and sensitivity including Yersinia and Campylobacter. Both stool and blood cultures were reported as negative.
Overnight his temperature settled on the antibiotics. The frequency of bowel motions remained unchanged and his stools remained blood stained. His C reactive protein and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated. Oral mesalazine was not administered during the first 24 hours in hospital but was recommenced on the second day as an in-patient.
After 2 doses of oral mesalazine he developed rigors, high temperature, tachycardia and two episodes of vomiting. At the time sepsis was the major consideration but the possibility of a drug reaction was considered. The frequency of bowel motions increased to 15 per day. A second set of blood cultures was performed. He was commenced on piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g IV tds.
A Computed Tomography scan of abdomen with IV and oral contrast was carried out. This showed a thickened colonic wall, most marked in the rectum and distal sigmoid and also in the caecum. Some linear atelectasis was noted at the left lung base. These appearances were in keeping with the clinical diagnosis of a colitis with the distribution suggestive of a pancolitis most probably ulcerative colitis. IV hydrocortisone was commenced.
Oral mesalazine was discontinued after the second dose and he felt better post withdrawal of mesalazine. Both sets of blood cultures were provisionally reported as negative at this time. His clinical condition began to improve.
IV hydrocortisone was commenced on the fourth day of hospitalisation. 2 days later he was switched to oral prednisolone. He was discharged 3 days later on oral prednisolone.
As the oral steroids tapered he was started on azathioprine with stepwise augmentation of dose. His colitis reactivated and infliximab was introduced.

5091,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8213290-1,Extracted,"The patient, a teenage male, 16 years old, mainly having a short penis for (16 years), was suffering from progressive weight gain (for 9 years), unstable walking (for more than 1 month). The mother did not take drugs during her pregnancy, and there was no history of exposure to any poisonous and radioactive substances. He is an off-spring of non-consanguineous parents, born full-term normal delivery, with cephalic presentation, no history of hypoxia, birth weight 3.3 kg, no complications such as obvious hypotonia and feeding difficulties after birth (The birth length is not known). The child was breastfed till he turned 2 years old, and while he started walking at 2 years old, he commenced talking later than his peers. The child also showed slow reaction since childhood, poor academic performance, mild intellectual disability and social fear. Movement disorder was noted in July 2020, needing a visual reference when he walks, otherwise he walked unsteadily. The patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 105 kg, and his BMI was, therefore, 43.70 kg/m2. According to the percentile curve of height and weight of boys aged 2 to 18 years old obtained from the physical development survey of 9 provinces and cities in China in 2005, the patient's height is less than 3% of the same age and sex in the same region, and his weight is more than 97%. Further, he had thick and black hair with a thick posterior hairline to the neck, thick eyebrows, wide eye-distance, collapsed nose, some beard scattered around the mouth, no Adam's apple, changed voice, armpit hair, and smaller hands and feet when compared to his peers. There was no breast development on either side. He had a thick vulva and pubic hair and pigmentation in the penis and scrotum, but there had been no obvious enlargement of his penis since he turned 9 years old, no morning erection and no spermatorrhea. The penis was found to be about 4 cm long in the non-erected state, and the left testicle's volume was found to be about 1 mL. The right testis was not palpable.
Based on the patient's medical history, imaging examination and molecular genetic testing results, the diagnosis was SYS. Patient was advised to reduce weight, control blood lipids, blood glucose through appropriate strengthening of exercise and diet control in the future. At the same time, the family members were advised to provide mental training to the patients to strengthen their contact and communication with the outside world and improve the autistic symptoms of the patient. Because of the patient's bilateral cryptorchidism, it is recommended that the patient should be treated with bilateral cryptorchidism reduction fixation in the department of urology. After a follow-up of the patient for 2 months, the patient is still walking unsteadily and requires an auxiliary reference material to walk normally. There is no significant change in height compared to before, and the weight has dropped by about 2 kg in the past 2 months. The rest of the physical examination did not show significant changes. The symptoms of autism have improved slightly. The patient is willing to communicate with outsiders, his intelligence has not improved significantly, and his academic performance in school is still at the middle and lower levels.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [105.0, 'kg']}",145.0,137.75,152.25,"The patient's weight is 105.0 kg. For patient's whose weight is greater than 20 kg, the formula for computing the maintenance fluid is 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 20 kilograms). Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (105.0 kg - 20 kg) = 145.0 mL/hr.
Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 145.0 mL/hr."

His medical history was significant for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Ten years ago, the patient underwent a right kidney transplant due to poorly controlled hypertension and received post-transplant tacrolimus and mycophenolate immunosuppressive therapy. He lives by himself, and upon further investigation into his home environment, he reported having two air conditioning systems at least 40 years old. On admission, he was febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic. Physical exam revealed dehydration signs and decreased breath sounds on the left upper and lower lung fields with positive rhonchi and bilateral pitting edema in lower extremities.
The metabolic panel was pertinent for elevated creatinine of 2.79 mg/dL from a baseline of 2.15 mg/dL; CBC was remarkable for leukocytosis with left shift and normocytic anemia with hemoglobin at 9.5 g/dL. Urinalysis revealed +3 bacteriuria and +3 hematuria. Urine Legionella antigen was positive. EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, multiple premature atrial and ventricular complexes with prolonged QTc at 492. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly in addition to left upper lobe pneumonia with mild left pleural effusion (Figure ). Subsequent thorax/chest CT scan detected multifocal pneumonia notably concentrated in the left upper lobe with small left-sided pleural effusion, moderate cardiomegaly with trace pericardial effusion, and mediastinal, hilar adenopathy (Figure ).
The patient was started on 0.9% NaCl fluid resuscitation and azithromycin that later changed to the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin) due to possible drug interaction with tacrolimus. The nephrology team closely monitored and daily adjusted tacrolimus. Hydration was maintained cautiously to prevent the worsening of acute kidney injury. An echocardiogram revealed a 30% reduced ejection fraction, consistent with a previous echo. Cardiology followed up during hospital stay and recommended outpatient evaluation of automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) placement. He was placed on BIPAP at night and nasal cannula oxygen at daytime. Due to concerns over mobility and restrictive life space in the home environment, physical and occupational therapy recommended subacute rehabilitation (SAR) placement. The patient completed eight days of moxifloxacin and was discharged to rehabilitation.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [63, 'years'], 'creatinine': [2.79, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male', 'Race': 'Black'}",27.993,26.593,29.393,"The patient is 63 years old.

He reported leaving a bar when a shot was fired, hitting him in the foot. He noted pain and bleeding but was able to walk. His pain was worsened with palpation to the affected site. The patient denied any significant family history. His social history was significant for tobacco use of two packs per day and alcohol use of six to 12 beers a day.
Upon arrival, blood pressure was 152/85 mmHg, pulse was 76 bpm, respiratory rate was 18 bpm, the temperature was 97.6°F, and O2 saturation was 100% on room air. On examination, there was a wound with associated tenderness and edema to the medial aspect of the left foot with no other findings noted. A left foot x-ray was ordered and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine were administered intramuscularly. X-ray imaging revealed a large bullet fragment in the plantar soft tissue beneath the medial cuneiform as well as punctate fragments in the medial soft tissue near the large fragment. There were no fractures noted on imaging (Figure ).
Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was administered locally and removal of the bullet was attempted. The bullet path was tracked by following pieces of thread detached from the patient’s shoe, which was found to be wrapped around the bullet (Figure ).
Bullet extraction was performed by pulling the shoe fibers along the bullet path. The severed tendon was visible upon extraction following bullet removal. Plantar and dorsiflexion of all toes of the left foot were intact. Orthopedic surgery was consulted and recommended a repeat x-ray which showed removal of the large bullet fragment in the plantar soft tissues (Figure ).

8047,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-7780453-1,Extracted,"A 36-year-old man (weight 81 kg, height 180 cm) symptomatic for fatigue and dyspnoea on mild exertion (New York Heart Association Class III) with past medical history of two aortic valve replacements (AVR) was referred to our institution because of a relapse of Staphylococcus warneri prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). He underwent the first AVR 2 years earlier for a steno-insufficient bicuspid aortic valve. After 8 months a redo AVR with annular reconstruction was needed due to PVE; S. warneri was isolated from the explanted valve. At time of referral the patient had completed the antibiotic therapy, the blood cultures were negative and the laboratory findings were within normal ranges. No risk factors for recurrent infections were identified. On physical examination, the main finding was a holodiastolic murmur over the aortic valve area. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a peri-prosthetic leak that determined a severe aortic insufficiency, good left ventricle’s (LV) contractility, and ejection fraction (EF = 60%). The transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography scan demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm at the level of the LV outflow tract (LVOT) extending towards the mitro-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (Video 1). Pre-operative coronary angiography (CA) showed normal coronary arteries ().
A modified-Bentall technique with a composite mechanical valve conduit (St. Jude Medical Masters HP valved graft with Gelweave Valsalva conduit) was carried out. After transecting the ascending aorta, two buttons of aortic wall including the coronary ostia were isolated and mobilized. By implanting the valved conduit, the pseudoaneurysm was excluded and the LVOT was reconstructed. Then, the ostia were sutured to two corresponding openings in the Dacron graft with a continuous suture of 6-0 Prolene without using any foreign material and without the addition of glue. By using the Valsalva graft, tension-free anastomoses of the buttons were expected. No macroscopic technical problems were encountered.
At the time of weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) the LV showed signs of failure. Intraoperative TOE evaluation in the transgastric short-axis view revealed a marked hypokinesis of the entire anterolateral wall and septum from the basal segments to the apex. Transoesophageal echocardiography findings in addition to the concomitant anterolateral ST-segment elevation on the 12-lead ECG suggested an acute impairment in blood supply thorough the proximal left coronary system. The origin of both coronary arteries was identified on TOE; kinking was excluded and Doppler evaluation showed the presence of blood flow through the ostia. The haemodynamic instability and difficulty in CPB weaning prompted an early strategy to re-establish coronary perfusion to the left coronary system. Surgical revascularization was performed with a saphenous vein graft anastomosed to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery and reimplanted on the aortic Dacron conduit. The second attempt of weaning from CPB was successful with normal ECG tracing and good whole myocardial contractility. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with stable haemodynamic. A control CA was performed after 48 h. The angiography showed a significant stenosis of the left main stem (LMS) due to a recently developed lesion consistent with haematoma of the coronary wall. The saphenous vein graft to mid-LAD anastomosis was patent and effectively supported the coronary flow downstream the lesion (). No percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were performed for the lesion. Hospital monitoring, medical treatment (aspirin 100 mg/day and warfarin with a target international normalized ratio range 2.0–3.0 due to the mechanical aortic valve), and angiographic follow-up were planned.
The post-operative course was further complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia successfully treated with IV antibiotics. The patient presented neither symptoms nor signs of angina and was discharged home on Day 28. At discharge the echocardiogram showed a good functioning prosthesis, mildly decreased LVEF (56%). The control CA was repeated after 6 months. It clearly revealed the resolution of the haematoma, a recovered LMS and LAD artery, while the vein graft was occluded ().

She was endotracheally intubated by prehospital staff due to decreased level of consciousness, vomitus, and agonal respiration. On arrival to the ED, vital signs included temperature of 33.9°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 139/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 rpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% FiO2. Physical examination demonstrated a Glasgow Coma Scale score 3 without spontaneous respiration. The patient subsequently became hypotensive requiring five IV push-dose epinephrine doses (total 100 µg), followed by dopamine (10 µg/kg/min increased to 15 µg/kg/min), and then a norepinephrine infusion (10 µg/min). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm of 58 bpm, PR of 144 ms, QRS of 112 ms, and QTc of 659 ms. Serum chemistries measured as follows: lactate 7.6 mmol/L (0.5-1.0 mmol/L), glucose 193 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL), Na+ 142 mEq/L (136-144 mEq/L), K+ 3.2 mEq/L (3.7-5.2 mEq/L), Cl− 110 mmol/L (96-106 mmol/L), CO2 18 mmol/L (20-29 mmol/L), BUN 16 mg/dL (7-20 mg/dL), Cr 1.17 mg/dL (0.6-1.1 mg/dL), AST 21 IU/L (10-34 IU/L), ALT 99 IU/L (8-37 IU/L), and INR 1.2 (0.8-1.1). Initial ABG measured as follows: pH 7.32 (7.35-7.45), pCO2 30 mmHg (35-45 mmHg), pO2 249 mmHg (80-100 mmHg), and HCO3 16 (CMV FiO2 65%, PEEP 6, RR 16, and TV 500 mL). Initial serum APAP concentration measured 1,017 µg/mL. Serum salicylate and ethanol concentrations measured 7 mg/dL and negative, respectively. A preliminary urine drug screen of abuse detected only methadone. Expanded serum liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy detected caffeine, dihydrocodeine/hydrocodol, lidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide, and diphenhydramine. A chest X-ray revealed mild interstitial edema. Head computed tomography was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. There was no repeat ECG performed prior to transfer to transplant center; however, no dysrhythmias were observed on telemetry monitoring.
The medical toxicology service was consulted and recommended IV sodium bicarbonate (for prolonged QRS interval), IV NAC, IV 4-MP (15 mg/kg), and immediate HD. APAP concentration decreased to 825 µg/mL after initiation of IV NAC, and serial concentrations exponentially decreased during “triple therapy” (Figures and ). During HD, the IV NAC rate of administration was doubled to 200 mg/kg and then tripled to 300 mg/kg, and a subsequent dose of IV 4-MP 10 mg/kg was administered; these were performed due to concern of HD removal of both antidotes.
The patient's mental status improved during HD; however, she did not follow commands. Due to concern for potential severe liver injury given the massive initial APAP concentration and lack of institutional transplant services, she was transferred to a liver transplant center on hospital day one. On arrival to the liver transplant center, she was maintained on IV NAC and received an additional HD treatment. 4-MP was not readministered. IV NAC was discontinued when APAP concentrations were undetectable. The patient was awake and following commands but failed extubation due to respiratory distress and pneumonia. She was ultimately extubated to BiPAP and discharged to an inpatient psychiatry unit approximately eight days after ED presentation in a normal state of health.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [16.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [193.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [142.0, 'mEq/L']}",300.437,285.415,315.459,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mEq. To convert from 142.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 142.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 142.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 142.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 142.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 16.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 193.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 142.0 + (16.0 / 2.8) + (16.0 / 18) = 300.437 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 300.437 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 300.437 mOsm/kg."
440,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-4940809-1,Extracted,"A 74-year-old man with an unremarkable medical history was referred to the Roubaix Hospital emergency department on November 13th 2012. The reasons for his consultation were headaches, vomiting, walking trouble, and dysarthria of sudden onset a few hours ago. His vital signs were blood pressure: 156/57 mmHg, heart rate: 103/min, and body temperature: 95°F (35°C). The first examination of the patient revealed cerebellar signs such as ataxia, apraxia, and dysarthria. The initial level of consciousness was normal (Glasgow Coma Score (CGS) 15). The head CT scan was normal, without ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Because of meningeal signs, a lumbar puncture was performed and found only 2 cells per mm3. The neurological investigations were completed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confirming the absence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. A brainstem stroke was also discarded, and the basilar artery was permeable.
Few hours later, the patient deteriorated and presented coma (GCS 7), requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He was then transferred to our intensive care unit. The first lab results revealed a nonspecific inflammatory syndrome (white blood cells: 25,000/μL, C-RP: 96 mg/L) and renal failure (creatinine: 266 μmol/L, urea: 13.8 mmol/L). All standard toxic substances were negative (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and carbon monoxide). The chest X-ray revealed an alveolar infiltrate of the right lung. The renal ultrasound was normal.
Initial management included mechanical ventilation, sedation, volemic expansion, broad spectrum antibiotics to treat a possible meningitis, and intravenous acyclovir to treat a possible herpetic encephalitis.
Early evolution was marked by the persistence of shock requiring vasopressive support (norepinephrine). A few hours later, the patient presented an acute coronary syndrome, complicated by severe arrhythmias, namely ventricular fibrillation, responsible for a cardiogenic shock with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 30%.
Because of multiorgan failure, including cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and cardiac dysfunctions, several diagnoses were suspected. Normal levels of complement system’s proteins and plasma protein electrophoresis were not in favor of an autoimmune disease. c-ANCA antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, antinuclear, and lupus anticoagulant antibodies were negative, allowing to rule out Wegener’s granulomatosis, Goodpasture’s syndrome, and lupus erythematosus. Finally, a thrombotic microangiopathy was also suspected, but ADAMST 13 activity was normal. In addition, there was no hemolytic anemia, neither thrombopenia. It should be noted that viral serologies such as HIV and B and C hepatitis were also negative.
After discussion with the radiologist and the neurologist, it appeared that the first MRI might have been realized too early. A second one was then performed on November 16th (day 4). It showed several abnormalities as follows: hyperintense lesions of thalami (Figure a), dentate nuclei (Figure b), posterior white matter in the brainstem pons, and periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain (Figure c) on fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion weighted-sequences.
At day 7, the son of the patient brought us the answer: an old empty extinguisher (Figure ). The patient used it in the morning of his consultation to unclog his sink and he inhaled the content of the extinguisher, which contained methyl bromide. A blood sample was sent to specialized toxicology laboratory in Paris. The methyl bromide blood level was over 120 mg/L (normal level <0.05 mg/L). Assuming a 12-day half-life for methyl bromide [], his serum bromide was probably much higher at his admission (7 days before the blood sample). Four weeks later, methyl bromide was still positive in the patient’s blood (Figure ).
Several authors have studied methyl bromide’s neurotoxicity and reported similar brain MRI results. Bilateral strikingly symmetrical high signal intensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences have been reported in the bilateral dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, periventricular area of the fourth ventricle, dorsal medulla (inferior olivary nuclei, restiform bodies, vestibular nuclei), dorsal pons, periaqueductal gray matter, superior and inferior colliculi, posterior putamen, subthalamic nuclei, and corpus callosum. These lesions were hypointense on T1-weighted images and devoid of mass effect. Post-gadolinium studies demonstrated no enhancement [-]. These lesions were thought to be related to local injury due to ischemia resulting from vasospasm, to increased axonal and interstitial water content, and also to a direct effect of the methyl bromide on Purkinje cells’ nucleic acid [,].
As regards to the cardiovascular system, the patient presented an acute coronary syndrome at day 2, responsible for a cardiogenic shock. The diagnosis was made based on the combination of an elevated troponin up to 54 μg/L and changes in the 12-lead electrocardiogram. There was indeed a de novo ST elevation and a Pardee wave in the inferolateral territory, with mirror images in the anterior territory. The transthoracic echocardiography revealed kinetics abnormalities in the corresponding territories and a decreased left ventricle ejection fraction at 30%. The patient also presented ventricular fibrillation, reversed after three external electric shocks. Given the fact that the patient was highly unstable, presented acute renal failure, and in the hypothesis of a septic shock, we decided not to perform an angiocoronarography immediately. The cardiogenic shock was controlled after 4 days of cardiotropic treatment by dobutamine, and the electrocardiogram was back to anterior state within 48 h, under cover of a treatment by double platelet anti-aggregation. One month later, the LVEF increased at 50%.
The angiocoronarography performed around day 40 found normal coronary arteries. The assumption of a myocardial infarction induced by the methyl bromide himself was then not confirmed. The major etiological hypothesis for this cardiac and/or coronary distress is a side effect of the severe initial shock with low cardiac output. Indeed, initial cardiac ultrasound showed localized kinetics abnormality, well correlated with electrocardiogram, which did not suggest a stress cardiomyopathy such as Takotsubo (no contrast between apex and basis of the left ventricle). A direct cardiotoxicity of the methyl bromide is quite unlikely because no similar case has been described in the literature.
As regards to renal failure, the urinary balance showed a proteinuria at 2.15 g/day. The renal ultrasound showed no obstruction of the urinary tract, two kidneys of normal size, and a good corticomedullary differentiation.
The renal function got worse to reach a real anuria with creatininemia at 575 μmol/L and ureamia at 38,2 mmol/L. Extrarenal epuration was required for 11 days. We used a continuous venovenous hemofiltration instead of intermittent dialysis because of hemodynamic unstability. A normal renal function was finally reached in 16 days, with a creatininemia at 90 μmol/L, and a normal urinary output. This renal failure seems to be of renal type. On the first blood sample from the emergency ward, creatinine level is already more increased than the urea is. The natriuresis was never locked. Moreover, the early volemic expansion and hemodynamic stabilization had no effect on renal function and diuresis. This renal failure can easily be explained by the methyl bromide himself [].
As regards to respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia was suspected at day 4. The patient presented hyperthermia at 101.3°F (38.5°C), an important inflammatory syndrome with C-RP at 195 mg/L and a right alveolar infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Two days later, in spite of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment (Tazocilline), it progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 80 and bilateral diffuse alveolar syndrome on the chest X-ray. There was no argument in favor of a cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, in spite of the concomitant ventricular dysfunction, because the left ventricular filling pressures were low. The patient required specific ARDS ventilation and curarization. Finally, ARDS quickly resolved, and the patient did not require prone positioning. The pulmonary evolution was also marked by the occurrence at day 8 of a pneumothorax under mechanical ventilation, which had to be been drained by a chest tube.
All the respiratory events were obviously not the result of direct injury of the intoxication but were induced by the neurological injury, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Delayed weaning from the ventilator was partly related to ventilator-associated pneumonia. In addition, the patient presented a polyneuropathy with tetraparesia. ICU-acquired weakness or “critical illness polyneuropathy” was confirmed by an electromyogram showing a peripherical neurogenic disturbance. It was certainly favored by 56 days of mechanical ventilation and the severity of the multiple organ failure []. However, this kind of peripheral neuropathy has also been frequently described in cases of methyl bromide poisoning [-]. On top of this, the methyl bromide intoxication resulted in central neurological effects, such as delayed awakening, and alertness disorders. Moreover, the patient experienced swallowing disorders, probably due to the methyl bromide intoxication itself [,]. A percutaneous tracheotomy was performed because of weaning difficulties.
Finally, the patient was decanulated after 56 days of mechanical ventilation. A brain MRI, performed 6 months later, showed that most of the lesions had improved. It remained only sequels on the left internal capsule and specifically the thalamus and the dentate nucleus. According to the literature, brain MRI lesions due to methyl bromide toxicity are frequently reversible [,,]. He has been transferred to a rehabilitation department specialized in rehabilitation of neurological patients. To date, he is back home. After hours of physical and speech therapy, he still faces sequels such as dysarthria and ataxia and needs a Zimmer to walk by himself.
As far as pathophysiology is concerned, several mechanisms seem to be the cause of the methyl bromide toxicity. Most of the authors have described a cellular toxic effect. Indeed, following a methylation reaction, the methyl bromide conjugates itself with glutathione to make methylglutathione, which is highly toxic for the respiratory chain [-]. A second cause often described is the modulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid receptor within the cerebellar and vestibular systems [,,]. A third hypothesis attributes toxicity to methyl bromide metabolites such as methanethiol and formaldehyde [,]. Another suggested mechanism is that methyl bromide rapidly inhibits creatine kinase activity in all regions of the brain and in other target organs. Creatine kinase is an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine to adenosine diphosphate and phosphocreatine [,].","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [74, 'years'], 'creatinine': [266.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Male'}",21.133,20.076,22.19,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 74 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 266.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 266.0 µmol. To convert 266.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 266.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000266 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000266 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.03 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.03 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.03 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 30.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 30.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 3.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 266.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 3.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (3.0/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**74 * 1.0 = 21.133.
Hence, the GFR value is 21.133 ml/min/1.73 m²."
4468,20,Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis,severity,integer,pmc-4538967-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old female presenting with complaints of fever, chills, and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection including sore throat and difficulty swallowing for three days arrived at our emergency department in December 2014. The patient did not have vomiting, diarrhea, chest distress, abdominal pain, rash, jaundice, cough, or expectoration. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol intake, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease or other chronic diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis, typhoid fever, or other infectious diseases. In addition, there was no history of trauma, surgery or history of medicine, or food allergies. One month previously, the patient had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and prescribed methimazole (10 mg BID) and propranolol (20 mg BID) at a local hospital. The patient discontinued the medicine after taking this treatment for ten days and three weeks prior to admission, since she thought that she may be pregnant because of a delayed menstrual cycle.
The patient's initial assessment in the emergency department revealed a temperature of 39.9°C, heart rate of 129 beats/min, and blood pressure of 174/76 mmHg. The patient had pharyngeal congestion, bilateral tonsil enlargement, and visible purulent secretions on bilateral tonsils. The patient had a mild hand tremor; however, there was no rash or jaundice. There were normal S1 and S2 sounds in cardiac examination. The patient's abdomen was normal, and no peripheral edema or lymphadenopathy was observed. There was bilateral grade 2 thyroid enlargement. There was no evidence of ophthalmopathy. The results of a neurologic and rheumatic examination were unremarkable.
The laboratory findings before antithyroid treatment were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count were normal at 5200/μL (reference range, 3500 to 10500/μL) and 2300x/μL (reference range, 1500 to 8000/μL), respectively, with free T3, 16.8 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71–3.71 pg/mL), free T4 3.9 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7–1.48 ng/dL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.0001 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.35–4.94 μIU/mL) in thyroid function tests.
The results from peripheral-blood count tests showed an absolute neutrophil count of zero and a WBC count of 400/μL at admission. Hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were normal at 13.6 g/dL (reference range, 11.5–16.5 g/dL) and 165 × 103/μL (reference range, 100–400 × 103/μL), respectively. C-reactive protein level was markedly elevated at 155 mg/L (reference range, 0–5 mg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm/h (reference range, 0–10 mm/h). Thyroid function tests were as follows: free T3, 3.63 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71–3.71 pg/mL), free T4 2.2 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7–1.48 ng/dL), and TSH, 0.0001 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.35–4.94 μIU/mL). The pregnancy test was negative. Results from the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiography divulged no infiltration. An abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. A peripheral-blood smear was normal except for agranulocytosis. There were no pathological findings except for borderline anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity in rheumatic, viral, and bacterial serological tests (). Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with ATD-induced agranulocytosis, acute tonsillitis, and hyperthyroidism.
On admission to our hospital, the patient was given intravenous antibiotics (amikacin and imipenem) to control infection and propranolol to hinder T4 transformation into T3 and to prevent excitatory effects on the heart. Methimazole was not restarted because of the neutropenia. After three days the neutrophil count increased to 600/μL, after six days the neutrophil count increased to 700/μL, and after seven days the neutrophil count increased to 2600/μL. After 10 days of treatment, a blood culture yielded no microbes, the neutrophil count was increased to 2900/μL, and the patient's symptoms were generally improved; the patient no longer had fever or throat symptoms. With clinical improvement of her symptoms and recovered neutropenia, antibiotherapy was discontinued.
Results from the thyroid ultrasonography showed bilateral parenchymal heterogeneity, increment blood supply, and a 16 mm solitary nodule in the right thyroid lobe. On thyroid scintigraphy, there was diffusely increased radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland and a hypoactive nodule in the right lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy performed at two different times on the nodule was insufficient. The option of surgical treatment was agreed upon because possible thyroid malignancy could not be ruled out due to inadequate biopsy results. In January 2015, she received a bilateral total thyroidectomy for surgical treatment after obtaining euthyroidism with combination therapy including lugol solution, corticosteroid, cholestyramine, and propranolol. The results of surgical histopathology were consistent with a benign nodular hyperplasia. The patient was followed with levothyroxine replacement treatment and the absolute neutrophil count remained within the reference range at 1600 to 3600/μL.",What is the patient's Centor Score?,"{'age': [41, 'years'], 'Tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes': False, 'Exudate or swelling on tonsils': True, 'Temperature': [39.9, 'degrees celsius'], 'Cough Absent': True}",3,3,3,"The current Centor score is 0.

Right flank pain had occurred 10 days before this admission, and treatment was then prescribed for a muscle strain at a rural hospital. The pain, which radiated to the right upper abdomen, was accompanied with a fever, which developed for 3 days. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further analysis and management. Upon arrival to our hospital, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, a heart rate of 122 beats/min, blood pressure of 120/72 mm Hg, and a body temperature of 39.5°C. A physical examination revealed mild pale conjunctiva, rapid regular heart beats, tenderness, and rebounding pain over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and also a knocking tenderness over the right flank region. Laboratory tests uncovered a white blood cell count (WBC) of 31,700/mm3, with segmented neutrophils at 96.6%, hemoglobin at 10.8 g/dL, platelet counts of 407 × 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen at 50 mg/dL, creatinine at 2.7 mg/dL, lactate at 16.3 mg/dL, albumin at 2.3 g/dL, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase at 122 U/L, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase at 49 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase at 486 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 432 U/L, C-reactive protein at 40.4 mg/dL, blood glucose at 106 mg/dL, along with other test result levels which were unremarkable. A CT scan demonstrated fluid accumulation at the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal spaces, multiple cystic lesions within the right kidney, along with an irregular surface of the kidney adjacent to retroperitoneal fluid (Fig. ). Purulent fluid was aspirated from the right subphrenic space for analysis, with the results indicating there was a WBC of 78,750/mm3, with an 85% level of segmented neutrophils. Percutaneous catheters were implanted for drainage of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscesses using ceftriaxone at 2000 mg once daily. Six days later, an uncontrolled sepsis persisted due to the patient's failure to respond to medical treatment. Subsequently, a nephrectomy for the renal abscess was carried out involving debridement of the retroperitoneal abscess. Anaerobic cultures of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscess grew both A israelii and Bacteroides fragilis. Aerobic cultures of the ascites and abscess uncovered no traces of bacteria. An anaerobic culture of the nephrectomy specimen yielded A israelii. Anaerobic, aerobic bacterial, and fungal cultures of the patient's blood and urine proved to be negative. Acid fast stain and cultures for tuberculosis were not found in either the urine or nephrectomy specimen. The pathologic results revealed multiple renal abscesses involving actinomycosis with the characteristics of sulfur granules (Fig. ). A full course of antibiotics with intravenous penicillin G (3 million units every 4 hours) was prescribed for 2 weeks, followed by oral penicillin V given at a dose of 2 grams per day for 6 months at our out-patient facility.

The patient's concentration of ALT is 49.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of platelets is 407000.0 count/µL. To convert 407000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 407000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 407000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 407000000000.0/(10^9) = 407.0 billion platelet counts per liter.

She also reported a 2-day history of general malaise and worsening dyspnoea. She denied chest pain, palpitations, diarrhoea or headaches. She reported eating; however, she limited herself to several small high-protein carbohydrate-free meals in an attempt to quickly return to her prepartum weight. Since her delivery, she had achieved an intentional weight loss of 30 lbs. Initial vital signs were: temperature 37 °C, blood pressure 140/63 mmHg, heart rate 84, respiratory rate 20 and a weight of 59.8 kg. She appeared unkempt and lethargic. Head and neck examinations were benign. Chest auscultation was clear with no adventitious sounds; heart examination was unremarkable. The abdomen was benign with a well-healed surgical C-section scar; there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. The extremities were without tenderness or oedema. She had no neurologic defects other than her blunted mentation.
Her past medical history was significant for a cesarean section, complicated by bladder damage, now resolved. Her only medication was percocet to manage post-surgical visceral pain. She denied alcohol or illicit substance use.
Initial laboratory data include sodium of 144 mEq/L, potassium 4.8 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate <5 mEq/L that is the lowest available determination possible at our institution. Her BUN was 3 mg/dL, creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL and glucose was 133 mg/dL. Serum lactate was 2.1 mmol/L, phosphate 1.0 mg/dL and magnesium 1.6 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas drawn on room air showed a pH of 6.9, PCO2 of 19 mmHg, PaO2 of 137 mmHg and SaO2 of 100%. White blood cell count was 17 600/mm3 with 88.2% segmented neutrophils, Hg 13.7 g/dL, haematocrit 43.1% and platelets of 340 000/mm3. Urinalysis had a pH of 5.5 with <80 mg/dL ketones. The serum osmolar gap was 7. A comprehensive drug screen was negative including salicylates and acetaminophen. Chest radiograph was normal. Blood and urine cultures were negative.
The patient was volume-depleted with a metabolic acidosis and a serum anion gap of 35.

Rhythm upon arrival was ventricular fibrillation. Since return of spontaneous circulation could not be achieved by all medical measures provided, the patient was immediately transferred to the catheter laboratory. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation via venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) was established. Due to severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, an Impella® pump was added to ensure sufficient LV output. Subsequently, percutaneous coronary angiogram was performed and showed no coronary disease (). The patient's history was noticeable for anorexia nervosa (AN) with several hospitalizations for renutrition, at the last several months prior to emergency admission. During the last few days prior to sudden cardiac death and after excessive caloric restriction, our patient began to increase her caloric intake to improve her nutritional state to avoid complications at an upcoming doctor's appointment. Prior to admission, our patient was an outpatient; did not receive medical refeeding or preventive treatment with supplementation of vitamins, phosphorus, or micronutrients; and did not had a history of binge episodes.
Initial blood analysis showed a severe electrolyte disorder with potassium depletion (1.38 mmol), hypocalcemia (ionized calcium 1.75 mmol/l), hyponatremia (117 mmol/l), hypochloremia (54 mmol/l), hypophosphatemia (0.28 mmol/l), and hypoproteinemia (total protein 30.2 g/l; albumin 28.9 g/l). In addition, laboratory data indicated a high level of lactate (18 mmol/l) combined with a normal pH of 7.38. Initial sugar levels were elevated (blood glucose 430 mmol/l). The first performed echocardiogram confirmed severe LV dysfunction. In the electrocardiogram, a sinus tachycardia and prolongation of the corrected QT interval were detected (660 ms) (). Electrolytes were substituted. Transient anisocoria and simultaneous severe coagulopathy under va-ECMO therapy led to a cranial computed tomography (CT), showing small bilateral subdural hematoma (). Most likely, the patient had aspirated during resuscitation; therefore, calculated antibiotic therapy with ampicillin/sulbactam was given. After initiating inodilatative support with levosimendan, cardiac output significantly improved within the next 24 hours. The Impella® pump and va-ECMO were subsequently removed on day 3. After the patient's respiratory situation had stabilized, extubation took place on day 5. Neurological assessment 10 days after admittance showed a mild difference in reflexes such as vertical saccade. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed on day 16, revealed unchanged small bilateral subdural hematoma (). Subsequent cardiac MRI performed after 2 weeks showed a recovered LV ejection fraction and no signs of myocarditis (). The patient was dismissed after 3 weeks of hospitalization without neurological deficit to a psychiatric care station for further treatment of AN.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of Albmumin is 28.9 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.9 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 2.89 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.9 g Albmumin/L converts to 2.89 g Albmumin/dL. 
The concentration of Calcium is 1.75 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 1.75 mmol. To convert 1.75 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.75 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.08 g Calcium. To convert 0.08 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.08 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 80.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 80.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 8.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 1.75 mmol Calcium/L converts to 8.0 mg Calcium/dL.

1741,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-6410487-1,Extracted,"An 84-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 58 years of age in 1987. He received human insulin treatment for 20 years, but in 2011, biphasic human insulin 30 was changed to biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30). He had stage 4 chronic kidney disease due to nephrosclerosis, renal anemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and sleep apnea syndrome. He had been taking the following medications: amlodipine 10 mg/day, rosuvastatin 2.5 mg/day, and febuxostat 20 mg/day. He drank alcohol occasionally and had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years when he quit 15 years ago. He did not have any food or drug allergies. His family and social histories were not remarkable. His environmental history revealed no abnormalities. He was a retired company director. From January 2015, he experienced persistent early morning hypoglycemia (< 50 mg/dl) with daytime hyperglycemia. Despite reduction of BIAsp 30 dosage, early morning hypoglycemia concomitant with disturbance of consciousness continued to occur. Therefore, he was admitted to our hospital in February 2015.
On examination, the patient’s temperature was 36.3 °C, pulse 64 beats/min, blood pressure 126/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to time and place on admission. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, normal limb power and sensation, and absence of cerebellar signs. No changes in sensorium or psychotic features were noted. Other physical examinations revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory findings on admission were as follows: fasting plasma glucose, 82 mg/dl; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 7.0%; and glycoalbumin, 21.4%. More laboratory test results are shown in Table . Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, showed no significant change.
Although BIAsp 30 was discontinued after admission, early morning hypoglycemia with daytime hyperglycemia continued even after eating small frequent meals (a four or six meals per day eating pattern). Fasting blood samples revealed a plasma glucose level of 28 mg/dl, immunoreactive insulin > 2000 μIU/ml, C-peptide 3.03 ng/ml, and high titers of insulin antibody (IA) (> 50 U/ml). IA binding rate was at a high level (86.3%). Scatchard analysis showed an affinity contact (K1) of 0.00256 × 108 M− 1 and a binding capacity (B1) of 99.7 × 10− 8 M against human insulin for the high-affinity sites, indicating that the patient’s IA bound to insulin with low affinity and high binding capacity. He had no history of medication involving SH residues or supplements containing α-lipoic acid. Moreover, workup for endocrinological abnormality and autoimmune disease did not reveal any significant findings (Table ). HLA-DRB1*04:06 was undetectable, and imaging studies of the head and abdomen showed no evidence of abnormalities.
The patient’s serum creatinine level was 2.17 mg/dl, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 23.3 ml/min/1.73 m2. His arterial pH at 5:00 a.m. was 7.277, bicarbonate was 15.1 mEq/L, and base excess was − 10.7. After he was given a gradually increasing dose up to 3 g/day of sodium bicarbonate (split four times per day) for the purpose of correcting metabolic acidosis, his early morning glucose level was improved, concurrently bringing pH up to 7.4 (Fig. ). Early morning hypoglycemia disappeared after he took 3 g/day of sodium bicarbonate and three meals plus snacks at night daily (1400 kcal/day) without any oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. The patient was discharged in late March 2015 and continued on the same treatment.
After 9 months of follow-up with these treatments, the patient’s plasma glucose level at 5:00 a.m. was 96 mg/dl, and his arterial pH was 7.376. His immunoreactive insulin level had significantly decreased to 11.4 μIU/ml, even though the titer of IA remained high (> 50 U/ml). IA binding rate decreased to 42.1%.

The patient had been in his usual state of health, until he told his family 3 hours before that he “felt sick.” The family incidentally found him on the floor, confused and lethargic, and immediately called the ambulance.
Upon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 96.4°F; pulse, 117 beats per minute; blood pressure, 151/93 mmHg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 100% on nonrebreather. The patient was known to have a history of recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, and his last episode of hepatic encephalopathy was in the prior 3 months, which was treated and controlled with lactulose. The patient's family stated that the patient had run out of lactulose 4 days before presentation. Other than lactulose, the patient was compliant with all of his home medications, including amlodipine, buproprion, cyclosporine, hydrocodone, lasix, methocarbamol, and ramipril. The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.
Physical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.
Fingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 μmol/L (reference range, 15–55 μmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.
Owing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.
During the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 μmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 μmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus. The patient did not immediately improve neurologically during the hospitalization stay and was ultimately transferred to another facility for continued treatment and rehabilitation.",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [104.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [22.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [141.0, 'mmol/L']}",3.0,2.85,3.15,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 141.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 141.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 141.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 104.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 104.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 104.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 104.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 104.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 104.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 22.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 22.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 22.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 22.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 15.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 15.0 - 12 = 3.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 3.0 mEq/L."

He denied any history of recent head trauma, fever or headache. On the initial presentation, blood pressure was 186/124 mmHg with a pulse rate of 83 per minute and afebrile. On examination, there was limited right eye movement on the lateral gaze. The rest of the physical examinations were normal. Computed tomography of the brain was normal. Intravenous and oral antihypertensive medications were initiated to control blood pressure. Blood investigations were normal. Special blood investigations that include antinuclear antibody, antistreptolysin O titer, C3, C4, random cortisol, aldosterone and renin level were also normal. Renal ultrasound () showed a small right kidney with multiple cystic areas and an enlarged lobulated left kidney. Given suspicion for renal mass causing the hypertensive emergency episode, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was performed. MRI () revealed a large well-circumscribed lobulated heterogeneous mass at the lower pole of the left kidney with dysplastic right kidney.
Considering suspicious MRI findings of left renal mass, a paediatric radiologist was consulted for a second opinion. Micturating cystourethrography () was then performed, which revealed right grade 5 vesicoureteric reflux, left upper pole grade 3 vesicoureteric reflux and left lower pole compensatory hypertrophy. Re-evaluation of the MRI images concludes findings of severely hydronephrotic and atrophied right kidney, atrophied upper pole and hypertrophied lower pole of the left kidney. Cystic areas in the right kidney correspond to severe hydronephrosis, while the enlarged lobulated left kidney represents hypertrophied left lower pole. At this stage, overall features were suggestive of chronic vesicoureteric reflux with bilateral reflux nephropathy. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan () carried out later has confirmed the diagnosis.

A conservative management plan was undertaken with repeated ultrasonographic evaluations every two weeks. The pregnancy, medical history of the patient and birth were unremarkable. A female full-term infant of 39+5 week of gestation was delivered with a birth weight of 4160 gram. Physical examination was unremarkable. Post-delivery ultrasonography revealed an anechoic uncomplicated cystic mass measuring 5x3.5 cm located in the right pelvis and another semi-solid complicated cystic mass was located in the left pelvis with a measure of 5.4x3.8 cm, without any vascular signal. Both ovaries were not identified.
Laparoscopy revealed brown round smooth cystic mass with a tiny stalk nearly amputated from the left fallopian tube in the left pelvis. A loop of intestinal segment also twisted around this calcified tiny stalk of the mass (Fig. 1). Right ovary was also twisted with the cystic mass (Fig. 2). The right ovary was untwisted 2 times (360 degree) and left in the pelvis after cyst aspiration without excision and ovarian fixation. Then the left ovary examined and seemed to be nearly amputated from the adnexa. It was removed after cyst aspiration. The calcified stalk was separated from the bowel. The post-operative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 2nd post-operative day.

8798,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-6726784-1,Extracted,"A 57-year-old man (174 cm, 65 kg) with a left femur neck and intertrochanteric fracture and pelvic bone fracture underwent surgical correction of the fractures. Entropy™ module monitoring (M-Entropy S/5 plug-in module, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) was used to ensure an adequate depth of anesthetic. Anesthesia was induced using 140 mg of propofol and 50 mg of rocuronium, and it was maintained using desflurane (5%–6%) and remifentanil (0.02–0.08 μg/kg/minute).
Seventy-five minutes after the induction of anesthesia, a sudden increase in the entropy indices up to 85 for SE and 95 for RE was noticed. Thereafter, despite an adjustment of desflurane up to 7% to 8%, SE and RE generally remained above 80 for 100 minutes throughout the main procedure with some fluctuations in accordance with the degree of surgical stimulation. We confirmed that the Entropy™ sensor was correctly placed on the patient’s forehead, and the sensor, which was re-checked, passed with normal results. Until this time, additional rocuronium had not been administered since anesthesia induction, and thus, we suspected that the increase in SE/RE may have resulted from increased EMG activity, although the patient did not move during surgery. After 10 mg of rocuronium was injected (, the first red arrow), SE/RE dramatically decreased to 30 to 40. At this time, train-of-four (TOF) monitoring (M-NMT Mechanosensor™, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) was started in the right adductor pollicis and the TOF ratio was 10. About 45 minutes later, a TOF ratio reached 70 and SE and RE also increased to 70 to 80. SE/RE returned to above 80 for about 30 minutes. After a second injection of 10 mg of rocuronium (, the second red arrow), SE/RE suddenly decreased to 30 to 40. About 20 minutes later, the patient’s blood pressure exceeded 150/90 mmHg and his heart rate increased to 110 beats/minute. Thus, the remifentanil infusion rate was adjusted from 0.08 to 0.12 μg/kg/minute (, blue arrow). Thereafter, SE/RE did not increase by more than 50, even though the TOF ratio increased to above 70 and no more rocuronium was injected until the end of surgery.
The patient’s blood pressure (systolic pressure range, 100–145 mmHg; diastolic pressure range, 55–80 mmHg), heart rate (range, 73–101 beats/minute), body temperature, and oxygen saturation maintained at stable levels, suggesting an adequate depth of anesthesia during the rest of the surgery. Total anesthesia time was about 7 hours and intraoperative fluid balance was adequate. The patient did not complain of any intraoperative recall after the surgery.
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish the details of his case. Ethics approval from the local ethics committee was not required because this case was based on routine clinical care using general anesthesia and it did not involve a human study.
The correlation between entropy indices and the TOF ratio using Pearson’s correlation test was studied off-line after the patient’s surgery. A two tailed P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. In the period between the first rocuronium administration and increasing the remifentanil dose (180–275 minutes, the first arrow to the blue arrow in ), the TOF ratio showed a strong correlation with RE, SE, and RE – SE (the difference between RE and SE) (r = 0.880, P < 0.001; r = 0.839, P < 0.001; r = 0.680, P = 0.001, respectively; ). Additionally, in the period between the first rocuronium administration and 80 minutes after increasing the remifentanil dose (180–355 minutes in ), the TOF ratio also showed significant but relatively low correlation with RE, SE, and RE – SE (the difference between RE and SE) (r = 0.693, P < 0.001; r = 0.708, P < 0.001; r = 0.418, P = 0.011, respectively; ). These results suggested that falsely elevated entropy values by EMG contamination could occur without sufficient analgesia.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [65.0, 'kg'], 'height': [174.0, 'cm']}",67.735,64.348,71.122,"The patient's gender is Male.

She had continued to provide her son an exclusively breastfed diet since birth. She reported an intentional 25-pound weight loss in the 18-week postpartum period. She had an unremarkable prenatal care and delivered a healthy baby boy at 40 weeks of gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her puerperium was otherwise uneventful. She denied smoking and use of alcohol. Dietary review revealed a typical breakfast consisting of egg and bacon; lunch usually consisted of some variation of vegetable salad with cheese, and a dinner consisted of vegetables and meat. Typical food items include vegetables such as peppers, spinach, broccoli, cheese, and carrot soups. For protein, she consumed mostly chicken, salmon, and other white fish. She avoided nuts or shellfish but would have 1-2 tablespoons of peanut butter per day. She eliminated all other forms of carbohydrate including wheat, pasta, bread, or any grain products. She denied any restriction in her daily caloric intake, stating that she consistently tracked her macronutrients at an average of 2200 Kcals per day.

Chest X-ray was normal and 12-lead ECG revealed sinus bradycardia with low-voltage QRS complex. Routine urine examination revealed pus cells 4–5, RBCs 2–3, absent albumin and casts. Renal ultrasound revealed relatively small-sized kidneys (right 8.5 × 3.2 cm, left 8.7 × 3.4 cm) with increased echogenicity, with maintained corticomedullary differentiation bilaterally. Her hormone profile revealed panhypopituitarism []. The diagnosis of panhypopituitarism most likely secondary to SS associated with acute renal failure was made on the basis of her past medical history of failure to lactate post her last child birth with gradual cessation of menses, peripheral signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, and abnormal biochemical and hormone profile.
The patient was given intravenous fluids in the form of dextrose normal saline with close monitoring of urine output, replacement therapy in the form of intravenous hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenously 6 hourly, and levothyroxine given orally at a starting dose of 50 mcg/ day. The patient was also given intravenous antibiotics and antiemetics. Urine output began to improve on the 2nd day of admission. Her appetite also improved and there was complete cessation of vomiting. On repeating renal function tests and other biochemical tests, there was dramatic improvement in serial renal function parameters. With improvement in the general condition of the patient, intravenous antibiotics were stopped in view of absence of fever and negative septic screen. She was shifted to oral prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, while levothyroxine was continued at a dose of 50 mcg/day. The serial biochemical parameters of the patient are given in . She was discharged on the same medication on 10th day of admission and was advised to taper prednisolone to 5 mg/ day after 2 weeks. Four weeks after discharge, the patient had general sense of well-being with better appetite and renal function had normalized with creatinine 0.64 mg/ dl and serum urea 23 mg/dl.

Fourteen years before presentation, she noticed protrusion of her right ankle but did not undergo evaluation at a hospital. Eight years before presentation, at age 19, she experienced acute pain and swelling of her right ankle. The pain resolved spontaneously but recurred 6 to 7 times/year, involving the bilateral metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, bilateral ankles, and right knee. Her serum urate level (SUA) was elevated to 789 μmol/L. A diagnosis of gout was made, and she was prescribed NSAIDs for pain relief and allopurinol and benzbromarone to lower her urate level. However, she discontinued allopurinol and benzbromarone on her own as these medications triggered acute flares. Five years before presentation, she noticed multiple nodules in her MTP joints, ankles, and fingers. The nodules on her feet interfered with normal walking. She also complained of the inability to conceive after 3 years of attempts. Her age at menarche was 14 years, and her cycles were irregular. She was reported to prefer snacks and fatty food during her childhood. Her father had hypertension. Her grandfather had an SUA level greater than 400 μmol/L but without gout. On physical examination, the patient was generally healthy, with a height of 168 cm and a weight of 55 kg. Her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. On abdominal palpation, the liver was enlarged with a normal soft texture. A joint examination revealed multiple nodules on the bilateral MTP1 joints, ankles, and fingers.
A serological examination after overnight fasting revealed a SUA level of 548 μmol/L, serum creatinine (Cr) level of 49 μmol/L, fasting glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L, total triglyceride level of 6.22 mmol/L, and total cholesterol level of 6.60 mmol/L. Her resting lactate level was 7.4 mmol/L. Her 24-h urine urate level was 2.262 mmol/24 h, and her fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) was 2.48 %. Her liver enzymes were normal. The estrogen level and basal body temperature curve were normal for her age and menstrual status. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal kidney size with possible calcium deposits in the bilateral renal medulla. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of her abdomen showed hepatomegaly without nodules. The pelvic ultrasonography and salpingography findings were normal. Serum examinations of her parents and her husband were normal.
Whole blood DNA was extracted from all four family members (the patient, both parents, and her husband) after signing an informed consent form. A genetic study was first conducted with a target gene sequencing approach. A search of the OMIM, NIH, and PubMed databases using the key words “FEMALE,” “GOUT,” and “HYPERLACTACIDEMIA” indicated familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, glycogen storage disease type I, and glycogen storage disease type II. Next-generation sequencing was used to sequence each of the exons of the UMOD, RENIN, G6PC, SLC37A4, and GAA genes, as well as two SNP loci (rs2231142 and rs72552713) of ABCG2 found in our previous report of a family including a female with gout.
The genetic sequencing results showed that UMOD, RENIN, SLC37A4, GAA and rs72552713 of ABCG2 were all normal in the patient and her family. Sequencing of the G6PC gene revealed composite heterozygous c.190G>T/c.508C>T mutations in the patient, a heterozygous c.190G>T mutation in her father, and a heterozygous c.508C>T mutation in her mother. The genetic analysis of her husband was normal. The c.190G>T mutation was located on exon 1 and encoded a missense mutation of p.V64L, whereas the c.508C>T mutation was located on exon 4 and encoded a nonsense mutation of p.R170X (Fig. ).

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 27 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 49.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 49.0 µmol. To convert 49.0 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 49.0 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.9e-05 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 4.9e-05 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.006 g creatinine. To convert 0.006 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.006 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 6.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 6.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.6 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 49.0 µmol creatinine/L converts to 0.6 mg creatinine/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 19.487 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 19.5, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 55.0 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 27) * 55.0 * 0.85) / (0.6 * 72) = 122.286 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 122.286 mL/min."

The patient also showed signs of high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 19.7 mmol/L and osmolar gap of 91.34 mOsm/kg H20. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Electrocardiogram findings showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 134 beats/min, whereas chest radiography showed mild pulmonary edema. Fluid replacement, sodium bicarbonate, and thiamine were administered as the initial treatment, and fomepizole was loaded at 15 mg/kg intravenously and administered four times, each at 10 mg/kg in 12-h intervals. One hour after admission, the patient's consciousness deteriorated from lethargy to stupor, necessitating tracheal intubation. Two hours after admission, overall condition deteriorated and acidosis was not corrected. Consequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit, where continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Thirty hours after dialysis, metabolic acidosis was controlled, as indicated by pH 7.46, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 106 mmHg, HCO3 25.6 mEq/L, and anion gap 5.9 mmol/L (). His vital signs stabilized on the 6th day of admission, and consequently, he was extubated. However, the patient's levels of BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 39 and 4.28 mg/dL, respectively, and his hourly urine output was only 10–30 mL, and calcium oxalate crystals were detected on urine microscopy (). The patient's acute renal failure persisted, and therefore the treatment was switched to routine hemodialysis, maintained at three rounds every other day. Starting from the 12th day of admission and the start of dialysis, daily urine output increased to >1,000 mL; thus, dialysis was discontinued. On the 23rd day of admission, the serum BUN/creatinine level decreased to 18.4/1.73 mg/dL, and the daily urine output was being maintained at 3000–4000 mL.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 136.4 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 6.7 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.7 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.7 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.7 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.7 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.7 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.4 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.7 mEq/L) = 19.7 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.7 mEq/L.
Plugging in 19.7 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 19.7 - 12 = 7.7 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 7.7 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 7.7 mEq/L / 17.3 mEq/L = 0.445. The patient's delta ratio is 0.445."

The renal stones were first discovered at a local hospital 6 years ago and then she underwent bilateral ureteroscopic lithotomy and ultrasonic lithotripsy several times, but the calculus still relapsed and her serum creatinine gradually increased to 240 to 300 umol/L. She was a teacher living with her husband and two children, all healthy, in a small city. She did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol. She had no significant past medical history, she had not suffered from any infectious disease, and she did not suffer from any chronic illness. There was no family history of similar disease or any other chronic illness. There was no history of allergy to any food or drugs. On physical examination: temperature (T) 37.5 °C, pulse (P) 82/minute, respiratory rate (R) 20/minute, blood pressure (BP) 130/80 mmHg, weight (W) 51 kg, and height (H) 154 cm. Respiratory movement and cardiac examination were normal. On abdominal examination no masses or tenderness were noted on both light and deep palpation. Her liver and spleen were not palpable. A sensory and motor system examination did not reveal any abnormality. Her neurological reflexes were normal. A routine urine examination showed: white blood cell 87/hpf (WBC2+), red blood cell 34/hpf (RBC2+), and pH 7. 0. A routine blood test showed: hemoglobin (Hb) 95 g/L. Her serum potassium was 3.2 mmol/L, calcium 2.92 mmol/L, phosphate 1.3 mmol/L, carbon dioxide combining power (CO2CP) 17.8 mmol/L, creatinine 249 μmol/L, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1147 pg/ml (Table ), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level 42.98 nmol/L with reference range (RR) of 47.7–144 nmol/L, 24-hour urinary calcium 8.98 mmol/day (RR, 2.5–7.5 mmol/day), and 24-hour urine potassium 26.8 mmol/day. Liver and thyroid functions were all normal. Urine culture showed the presence of Escherichia coli. Renal ultrasound showed multiple stones, cysts, and calcified lesions. Computed tomography (CT) of her kidney showed MSK and polycystic kidney disease (Fig. ). Ultrasonography of her thyroid and parathyroid showed two hypoechoic nodules in the right lobe of her thyroid with the larger one of 26 × 18 mm. She was diagnosed as having MSK complicated with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent right parathyroidectomy on September 18, 2012. Histopathologic examination revealed adenomatous hyperplasia of parathyroid glands (Fig. ). After surgery, her serum potassium was 3.3 mmol/L, calcium 2.81 mmol/L, phosphate 1.01 mmol/L, CO2CP 16.1 mmol/L, PTH 742.5 pg/ml, and serum creatinine 231 μmol/L (Table ). The oral form of iron and calcitriol was administered.
In March 2013, 6 months after resection of her right parathyroid glands she was re-hospitalized because of generalized bone pain of 1 month’s duration. A routine urine examination showed: white blood cell 45/hpf (WBC1+), red blood cell 27/hpf (RBC1+), and pH 7. 5. A routine blood test showed: Hb 88 g/L. Her serum potassium was 3.1 mmol/L, calcium 2.83 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.21 mmol/L, CO2CP 19.7 mmol/L, creatinine 265 μmol/L, and PTH 1378 pg/ml (Table ). Her 24-hour urinary calcium was 8.5 mmol/L and 24-hour urinary potassium 29.6 mmol/L. A bone scintigraphy for whole body with 99mTc revealed increased activity in skull, rib, and sternum (Fig. ). Parathyroid and thyroid ultrasound showed multiple hypoechoic masses in left lobe, with largest ones being 25 × 23 mm and 22 × 20 mm. She was diagnosed as having MSK and tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent left lobe parathyroidectomy on March 27, 2013. A pathological examination of the resected parathyroid tissue showed parathyroid nodular hyperplasia (Fig. ). After surgery, her serum calcium was 2.25 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.07 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, CO2CP 16.8 mmol/L, PTH 47.81 pg/ml, and creatinine 257 μmol/L (Table ). Subsequently she was prescribed with oral form of iron and calcitriol at the time of discharge; later, she did not return for the scheduled follow-up visits.
On July 7, 2016, 4 years after parathyroidectomy she was readmitted to our hospital with the complaint of dizziness. A physical examination showed pale appearance, visible thyroid surgery scar, and mild swelling of both lower extremities. A routine urine analysis showed: white blood cell 41/hpf (WBC +) and pH 7.0. A routine blood test showed: Hb 76 g/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, calcium 2.09 mmol/L, phosphorus 2.37 mmol/L, CO2CP 15.6 mmol/L, serum creatinine 766 μmol/L, and PTH 766.4 pg/ml (Table ). Renal ultrasound showed MSK, multiple stones in both kidneys, and polycystic kidney disease. She was diagnosed as having MSK and tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis). She was started on replacement therapy. At 1-year follow-up, she was undergoing hemodialysis twice a week. A routine blood test showed: Hb 80 g/L. A routine urine analysis showed: PH 7.5 and protein positive (Pro2+). Her serum potassium level was 4.2 mmol/L, calcium 2.22 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.53 mmol/L, CO2CP 26.1 mmol/L, creatinine 619 μmol/L, and PTH 546 pg/ml.
Given the key role of the GDNF–RET interaction in kidney and urinary tract development, anomalies in these molecules are reasonable candidates for explaining a disorder such as MSK. However, mutations in RET proto-oncogene are also present in 97% of individuals with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A (MEN2A). In order to explore the possible genetic mechanisms, we analyzed the GDNF and RET genes in this patient. After obtaining informed consent from our patient, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard phenol–chloroform procedures. All 20 exons and flanking splice sites of the GDNF and RET genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers listed in Table . Mutations were identified by direct sequencing of PCR products on an ABI 3730xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Two RET polymorphisms were found in this patient, one was nonsynonymous c.2071G>A (G691S; rs1799939) located in exon 11 (Fig. ); the other was synonymous c.2712C>G (p.S904S; rs1800863) located in exon 15 (Fig. ). No mutation was found in the GDNF gene. Both parents of our patient are deceased. Further genetic testing of her husband, daughter, and sister were all negative for this polymorphism.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [51.0, 'kg'], 'height': [154.0, 'cm']}",48.569,46.141,50.997,"The patient's gender is Female.

It was associated with nausea and low back pain at the site of spinal puncture. The headache was global type and improved temporarily with hydration and oral caffeine intake. During follow-up, he presented to the Emergency Department with still recurrent headache and new onset of vomiting and blurred vision at day 10. There was neither history of trauma nor relevant past or family medical history for thromboembolic disorders; he had not been on any medical therapy before. On examination, he was conscious and oriented with a GCS of 15/15. His body temperature was 37.1°C, with a heart rate of 86 beats/min. His blood pressure was 133/85 mmHg, and his respiratory rate was 17 breaths/min. Fundoscopic examination showed bilateral papilledema, and no focal neurological deficits were recognized ().
Laboratory investigations revealed a sodium level of 131 mEq/L, blood urea and nitrogen levels of 4.5 mg/dL, a creatinine level of 55 micromole/L, and a level of glucose was 109 mg/dL. A complete blood count revealed a normal white blood cell count of 8×109/L, a hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL, and a platelet level of 356×109/L. The liver function test was normal, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 33 U/L, an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 16 U/L, a bilirubin value of 2 mg/dL, and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 103 U/L. Further hematological workup revealed normal levels of protein C and S. His D-dimer level was 2.1 nmol/L, with a fibrinogen level of 3.1 g/L. His partial thromboplastin time was 35 seconds and high prothrombin time was 11.1 seconds. Anticardiolipin and anti-lupus antibodies were negative. Fasting plasma homocysteine level is within normal range (13.4 µmol/L). Antithrombin III activity level is 114% which is within normal limit. The sickle cell screening is negative. The total cholesterol is 6.4 mmol/l, triglyceride 1.85 mmol/l, high density lipoprotein is 1.14 mmol/l, and low-density lipoprotein is 5.1 mmol/l. Further genetic tests that include factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation were negative.
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed increase signal intensity in both T1 weighted images (WI) and T2WI as well as bilateral superficial cortical veins with filling defect as seen in the magnetic resonance venography (MRV); there was no diffusion restriction suggesting venous infarction (Figure 1). Findings are consistent with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis.

The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 131.0 mEq. To convert from 131.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 131.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 131.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 131.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 131.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 131.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 4.5 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 109.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 131.0 + (4.5 / 2.8) + (4.5 / 18) = 269.663 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 269.663 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 269.663 mOsm/kg."

The patient's height was 178 cm with a body weight of 60 kg. The patient had been treated with a low protein diet and oral administration of lactulose. Intermittent lactulose enemas were provided for intermittent alteration of consciousness. Recently, the patient has had more frequent alterations of his mental status with irritability and altered consciousness. Even though oral administration of L-arginine, Kanamycin and intravenous hyperalimentation with branched chain amino acids was started, his plasma levels of ammonia and citrulline were highly elevated, up to 844 µg/dL (normal range, 19 to 87 µg/dL) and 682 µmol/L (normal range, 12 to 55 µmol/L), respectively. Despite the conservative medical treatment including alternative pathway medication, intermittent continuous renal replacement therapy and hemodialysis, his condition failed to improve. Therefore, living donor liver transplantation was planned using a right lobe graft from his 25-year-old sister. However, the estimated volume of the donor's right lobe was 800 mL compared to 180 mL of the left and in addition there was a type III portal vein anomaly. We eventually decided to perform an APOLT using the extended left lobe of the liver from the donor. The patient underwent APOLT in February of 2008. The actual graft volume was 200 g and the graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was only 0.33%. The patient's extended left lobe (including caudate lobe) was resected and the extended left lobe graft (including middle and left hepatic vein) was transplanted orthotopically. The left and middle hepatic vein trunk of the extended left lobe graft was anastomosed to the left and middle hepatic vein trunk of the recipient in end-to-end fashion with interposition venoplasty using the recipient's greater saphenous vein as a patch. The left portal vein of the graft was anastomosed to that of the recipient in end-to-end fashion. Considering that the graft was too small, the recipient's right portal vein was narrowed by surgical clipping, instead of total diversion, for prevention of the development of portal venous hypertension. The left hepatic artery of the graft was anastomosed to that of the recipients in end-to-end fashion. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated that portal and arterial blood flow were well maintained in both the native liver and the graft. Biliary drainage was accomplished by a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. On postoperative day 7, abdominal computed tomography demonstrated orthotopically transplanted small left lobe graft with well-enhanced pattern (). The post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged without any problems. The plasma concentrations of ammonia were at the upper limits of normal, so only a low protein diet (50 g/day) was supplied without any specific medication. On post-operative day 33, the patient reported a sudden severe visual disturbance and the plasma levels of ammonia were noted to have increased up to 209 µg/dL. The estimated computed tomography volume of the graft was decreased to 190 mL and a left portal vein stenosis was suspected. Direct portography was performed and a severe left portal vein stenosis was confirmed. Immediate coil embolization of 8th segmental branch of right anterior portal vein and self-expandable stent placement for left portal vein was performed in order to increase the portal flow to the graft (). On post stent insertion day 7, the calculated computed tomography volume of the graft was increased to 250 mL (). The plasma level of ammonia was within normal range. By the thirtieth postoperative month, the patient had no signs of rejection or vascular problems.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [178.0, 'cm']}",73.182,69.523,76.841,"The patient's gender is Male.

The patient presented with the following symptoms upon admission: malaise, weight loss (10 kg), intermittent upper abdominal pain, watery diarrhea (three to four times daily), oliguria (500 mL/day), and transient skin flushes. The patient’s blood pressure declined from 120/90 mmHg to 100/70 mmHg. She did not receive any therapy before admission. Her medical history revealed that she had tuberculosis for 40 years and other unremarkable symptoms.
After physical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) scan, the following symptoms were detected: liver palm (palmar erythema), pot belly, bilateral lower limb edema, hepatomegaly (4 cm below the costal margin), mild splenomegaly, ascites, and nodular infiltration of the liver. Skin lesions, rashes, and superficial lymphadenopathy were absent.
Results of the laboratory examination performed at admission revealed a white blood cell count of 5.4×109/L with a normal differential count, hemoglobin level of 107 g/L, and platelet count of 249×109/L. The patient had a serum sodium level of 126 mmol/L (normal: 137-150 mmol/L), albumin level of 31.6 g/L (normal: 37-53 g/L), aspartate aminotransferase level of 12.9 U/L (normal: 0-40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase level of 13.2 U/L (normal: 0-40 U/L), gamma-glutamyltransferase level of 93 U/L (normal: 0-50 U/L), alkaline phosphatase level of 148 U/L (normal: 42-128 U/L), total bilirubin level of 6.5 µmol/L (normal: 0-20 µmol/L), direct bilirubin level of 1.4 µmol/L (normal: 1.7-6.8 µmol/L), and prothrombin time of 24.3 s (normal: 12-16 s). The tumor marker CA125 was present at a level of 207.6 U/mL (normal: <35 U/mL). Serological testing for hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV showed negative results. Autoimmune markers, other tumor markers, and blood and fecal cultures were negative.
A preliminary diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and laboratory examination results of the patient was made by the physician as follows: “hepatic cirrhosis, decompensated phase, however, etiology was not clear. In addition, given the tumor marker CA125 was in high level, exclude other abdominal or gynecological tumor was necessary.”
The patient underwent upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy three times during hospitalization because of persistent and intermittent diarrhea. She also underwent a liver biopsy. Subsequently, the patient developed anemia (hemoglobin level of 98 g/L). Bone marrow aspiration was performed, and results show an abundance of atypical hypogranulated round or spindle-shaped cells. The abundance of such cells conﬁrmed the presence of mast cell differentiation. Further immunohistochemical staining was performed on cells. Diffuse CD25 and CD117 in tryptase-positive mast cells infiltrated the gastric and colonic mucosa. Sheets of mast cells were present in the portal tract of the liver.
The liver biopsy highlighted an area of extinction comprising a large amount of spindled mast cells, fibrous tissue, entrapped hepatocytes, ductular reactions, and a portal spanning the width of the needle’s core (). Mast cells were positive for CD117 () and CD25, but negative for CD30. The mast cells were loosely scattered in the hepatic sinusoids within the hepatic parenchyma.
A diffuse hyperemia with superficial erosions was present. The mucosa showed a slightly raised appearance, which mimics the proliferative polyp found by upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy (). The results of histological analysis were as follows. Mucosal erosion and gland expansion and distortion were observed. Diffuse spindled mast cell infiltration in the gastric and colonic lamina propria was characterized by cells with small, elongated, and baculiform nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and pale cytoplasm (). These cells were admixed with some lymphocytes and plasma cells. The tumor cells were positive for CD117 (), and showed abnormal surface molecular expression of CD25. However, tumor cells were negative for CD30.
These ﬁndings were fully consistent with ASM according to the WHO criteria, and a diagnosis of ASM with extensive involvement of the liver and gastrointestinal tract was made. The patient received H1 and H2 histamine antagonists with improvement in diarrhea. The patient was discharged upon the demand of her family and the patient herself.

On admission, the patient was 162.8 cm tall and weighed 53.7 kg, with a body mass index of 20.3 kg/m2. Her blood pressure was 112/78 mm Hg. She showed Chvostek's sign, but no physical signs or digestive symptoms, including anorexia nervosa, vomiting, or diarrhea. She had not taken any medications, such as laxatives, diuretics, street drugs. She had also not attempted to lose weight. She was a nonsmoker nor alcohol drinker, and she had no allergies. The family history was negative for electrolyte imbalance or other forms of endocrinopathy. Her parents were not consanguineous.
Severe hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia in addition to hypokalemia without metabolic alkalosis were observed (Table ). Urinary calcium excretion was decreased, whereas urinary magnesium was elevated compared with low serum values. Her plasma renin and aldosterone levels remained within the normal range. The serum creatinine level and glomerular filtration rate were normal. Her intact PTH level was relatively low in consideration of severe hypocalcemia. The serum alkaline phosphatase level was normal. The laboratory findings were indicative of GS, except for hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypokalemia without metabolic alkalosis. A renal function test using furosemide or thiazide is desirable when GS is suspected.[ Therefore, we performed a renal function test in our case for assessment of the renal reabsorption rate of chloride in the distal tubule in morning fasting according to the described protocol.[ Her renal reabsorption rate of chloride in the distal tubule was markedly decreased using furosemide (from 68.4% to 10.4%), but not by thiazide administration (70.4% to 63.5%), which led to the final diagnosis of GS. To alleviate the symptoms of muscle weakness and tetany/seizure, she had adequate electrolyte supplementation therapy of 8.5% calcium gluconate (20 ml/d) and magnesium sulfate (40 mEq/d) infusion. These supplementations were tapered within 2 days of admission. She has taken no supplementation since day 7 after admission. The clinical course was uneventful. She had a regular diet. Her serum potassium level returned to the normal range, and muscle weakness and tetany disappeared, although her serum calcium and magnesium levels persisted at 2.2 mmol/l and 0.7 mmol/l, respectively, which slightly exceed the lower limit of the normal range. Without any additional potassium gluconate and calcium replacement therapy, her serum potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels during oral administration of a low dose of magnesium oxide (0.6 g/d) were all within the normal range after discharge from our hospital (Fig. ). Additionally, intact PTH levels were normalized (from 6.1 to 8.2 pmol/l) after hypomagnesemia was corrected.
Genetic analysis was performed using the patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes. It was first screened by targeted sequence including all salt-losing tubulopathy causative genes followed by Sanger sequence. As a result, she had 2 heterozygous mutations in the SLC12A3 gene, one of which has been reported previously as a GS disease-causing mutation (c.1732G>A, p.Val578Met).[ The other heterozygous mutation (c.2537_38delTT, p.846fs) has not been previously reported (Fig. ).

The patient's height is 162.8 cm, which is 162.8 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 64.095 in. 
For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (64.095 (in inches) - 60) = 54.918 kg.

Except penicillin allergy, she had no history of cardiovascular diseases, nor did she have any coronary risk factors, including smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coagulative disorder, oral contraceptive use, and/or family history of myocardial disease. Physical examination and routine preoperative laboratory tests, including chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were unremarkable with total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein within normal range.
After arriving at the operating room, ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring were attached to the patient. For induction of general anesthesia, thiopental sodium 200 mg, followed by rocuronium 20 mg, were injected intravenously and classic laryngeal mask airway (No. 4) was inserted. Then, she was positioned to lithotomy for the operation. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 5.0-6.0 vol% in 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen. The operation was uneventful for 30 minutes, with stable vital signs, except slight tachycardia with heart rate 105 to 120 beats/min. Further, the estimated blood loss was negligible.
At the end of the surgery, ergonovine maleate 0.2 mg distilled with normal saline 10 ml was intravenously administered slowly for a minute at the request of the surgeon for the uterine contraction. About 2 minutes later, EtCO2 suddenly decreased to 20 mmHg from 33 mmHg, followed by a loss of plethysmographic wave. The patient was cyanotic, but anesthetic monitor showed no noticeable change in the airway pressure and expiratory tidal volume. The blood pressure, although measured at 119/89 mmHg a few minutes ago, was not checkable with un-palpable radial pulse, and ECG showed severe bradycardia, followed by asystole.
Immediately, 1 mg epinephrine was injected intravenously, FiO2 increased to 100%, and thereafter, chest compression was started. Laryngeal mask airway was changed to endotracheal tube (No. 7), under direct laryngoscopy, right internal jugular vein cannulated and arterial line in the right radial artery established, while chest compression continued, inotropics infused and intermittent atropine and other drugs were administered. Even with these measures, the patient responded poorly and cardiac rhythm couldn't be detected. The patient was just showing low blood pressure of about 40/20 mmHg, which was observed via arterial line, probably due to chest compression. About 20 minutes after cardiac arrest, ECG returned to sinus rhythm but with tachycardia and ST elevation. Blood pressure increased to 60/20 mmHg, heart rate was at 130 beats/min, SpO2 85%, and arterial blood gas analysis with pH 7.2, PCO2 42.7 mmHg, PO2 54.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 18.2 mmol/L, base -8.2 mmol/L, and sO2 82%. Other hematologic and electrolyte were within normal limits and the results were as follows: Hemoglobin 12.2 g/dl, Hematocrit 39.7%, Na+ 136 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, Ca2+ 4.5 mg/dl, and Cl- 117 mg/dl. With continued intotropic support, nitroglycerin 100 µg was intravenously administered with the suspicion of myocardial ischemia. Within 5 minutes, blood pressure further increased to 123/80 mmHg, heart rate to 128 beats/min, SpO2 100%. However, afterwards, the systolic blood pressure decreased to 75 mmHg and SpO2 88% again, despite inotropic support.
Chest X-ray, taken immediately after arrival to the intensive care unit, showed bilateral diffuse pulmonary edema (). Even though ECG didn't show definite ST abnormalities, except sinus tachycardia (), cardiac enzymes were elevated as follows; troponin I 3.2 ng/ml (normal < 0.78), CK-MB 12.08 ng/ml (normal < 5). Transthoracic echocardiography showed the ejection fraction of only 22% (normal 56-78%), with severe hypokinesia in the inferior and septal area. Patient was unresponsive, blood pressure still low with systolic pressure below 80 mmHg and oxygen saturation around 75-82%. So, the patient was managed with the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Capiox SP Pump controller 101, Terumo, Japan) through left femoral veno-right femoral arterial route with initial blood flow of 2-2.5 L/min. After that, the hemodynamics and oxygenation became stable with blood pressure 100/47 mmHg, and SpO2 100%.
She regained consciousness at the night of the operative day, and endotracheal tube was removed the following day. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was weaned and inotrope infusion was stopped at the third postoperative day. Afterwards, she recovered and was discharged without cardiopulmonary complication.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She had a past medical history of left-sided epistaxis 4 years ago for which she initially underwent left sphenopalatine (SPA) endoscopic ligation. During this episode epistaxis recurred so she underwent left external carotid artery and left anterior ethmoid artery ligation. She was subsequently completely free of epistaxis for 4 years. Two months prior to the episode we present she suffered a further bleed, which was successfully treated with anterior nasal packing.
During this presentation she was haemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg, and had normal coagulation screen, biochemistry and full blood count. During endoscopy, a bleeding point in the left SPA region was identified and bismuth iodoform paraffin paste (BIPP) nasal packing applied. She continued to bleed intermittently. Angiography was planned prior to further surgical intervention due to her past history of left SPA ligation. This confirmed complete occlusion of left ECA (figure ). The right ECA demonstrated a few small nasal branches of the right SPA crossing to the left, with no evidence of a bleeding point initially (Figure ). A literature search revealed that sphenopalatine-sphenopalatine anastomosis has not previously been reported.
A microcatheter was advanced distally in the right SPA and angiography showed pooling of a small amount of contrast in the upper part of the left nostril. Embospheres in the 80–120 μ size range and PVA particles in the 355–500 μ range were injected into the right SPA. Subsequent angiography revealed a reduction in the number of the nasal branches and no further pooling (Figure ). The nose was packed anteriorly at the end of the procedure. Packing was removed 24 hours later and the patient has had no further bleeding, and was hemorrhage free at follow up.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [80.0, 'mm hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [160.0, 'mm hg']}",106.667,101.334,112.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

He had a fever one week prior admission that relieved with sacetaminophen, and no other complaints were reported. He had no contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients. He has history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. He previously consumed aspirin, bisoprolol, lisinopril, diltiazem, atorvastatin and subcutaneous insulin.
His blood pressure (BP) was 132/75 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 79 beats per minutes (bpm) regular, and respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation of 85% (free air) that improved to 95% with a non-rebreathing oxygen mask (NRM) 15 Liters per minute. His physical examination showed no increased jugular venous pressure, bilateral lung crackles, pleural friction rub, and leg edema.
Comprehensive evaluations were performed, including ECG, COVID-19 antigen swab, laboratory examination, and chest radiography. His initial ECG showed normal sinus rhythm of 79 bpm, left axis deviation, with inferior OMI. Laboratory data showed increased CRP (195.3 mg/L), hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), respiratory failure, and respiratory acidosis. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and bilateral pneumonia. COVID-19 antigen swab was positive. Thus patient and family were consent for isolation and tracing procedure. As his blood gas showed respiratory failure with severe ARDS (
PaO

FiO
2 82 mmHg), we planned on invasive ventilation, however the procedure was postponed due to unavailability of ventilator machine and intensive care unit overload.
He was then started on antibiotic treatment with moxifloxacin, antiviral therapy with remdesivir, dexamethasone, continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) multivitamins and his daily medication (insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, beta-blockers, nitrates, and atorvastatin). Tocilizumab 400 mg was also given on the second day of admission and continued for 5 days. His vital signs and laboratory examinations were routinely monitored.
During the sixth day of admission, his oxygen saturation deteriorated. He was then put on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with slightly better oxygen saturation (92-94%). His symptoms showed gradual improvement in several days. His laboratory examination on the tenth day showed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), increased D-Dimer. No prolonged hemostatic values were found. Plasma prothrombin time (PPT) was 20 sec, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 38.6 sec.
On the ninth day of admission, the patient reported gross hematuria, at that time he was still on unfractionated heparin therapy within targeted APTT. Laboratory data showed significantly reduced thrombocytes (40,000 mg/L). Urine examination showed gross hematuria with leukocyturia (10–15 cells/field), nitrituria, and proteinuria (2+). The patient underwent ECG and chest radiography evaluation, which showed no significant changes (
).
Heparin was thought to be the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia in this patient. Since heparin antibody was not routinely checked in the developing country, we choose HIT’s scoring system as an alternative. The scoring system shows 4Ts of 6 and HEP Scoring system of 5 (
). Both 4Ts and HEP scoring indicate a high-risk probability for HIT, hence the anticoagulant was switched to rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily. The symptoms were then improved with the absence of hematuria after 2 days. The thrombocyte evaluation showed normalization to 177,000 on the eleventh day.

501,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-5937041-1,Extracted,"A 14-year-old Kazakh girl who had ongoing difficulties in starting the stream of urine and intermittent interruption of the urinary stream while voiding, and bedwetting since her early years (persistent since she was 2 years old), which was stressful for both the parents and child.
Since that time, the girl has been treated by pediatricians using traditional methods (fluid and diet restriction, lifting and waking, dry bed training, bladder training and retention control, anticholinergic medication) without any success.
Her past medical history included regular medical checkups because of agenesis of her right kidney and pelvic ectopy of the single left kidney, a cyst of the bladder, and bedwetting. She had never had hematuria. Surgical interventions had not taken place. She is the second child of five in her family. The other family members do not have health problems.
On physical examination she was well. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg. Her pulse was 82 beats/min. A urine analysis was normal. Her renal function was normal with a creatinine of 90 μmol/L. Examination of other systems revealed an agenesis of her vagina.
On radiologic examination: on sonography her right kidney was not visualized; her left kidney was located in the pelvic region, and was 51.8 × 62.8 cm in size. Her urinary bladder volume was 156 cm3, and on the right side of the wall a cystic mass 23 × 20 mm in size was visualized (ureterocele?). A contrast media computed tomography (CT) scan revealed agenesis of her right kidney, pelvic ectopy of her left kidney; on the right side of the urinary bladder there was a cystic mass 24 × 17 mm in size (papilloma, ureterocele, mixed tumor); and agenesis of her uterus and vagina (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) was also detected (Fig. ).
On intravenous urography, her right kidney was not visualized, there was normal functioning of the left kidney located in the pelvic region, and excretory (descending) cystography shows a shadow of reduced density on the right side of the urinary bladder wall 23 × 20 mm in size (cystic mass, ureterocele) (Fig. ).
On the right extremity of the interureteric ridge, in the projection of the missing right ureteric orifice, a round-shaped cystic mass, 24 × 20 mm in size was seen, covered by a normal mucous membrane, located close to the bladder neck and protruding into the internal urethral meatus.
Based on the clinical presentation, sonographic, radiologic and endoscopic findings we concluded that some cystic masses (mixed tumor, dermoid cyst) of the bladder cause bladder irritation with symptoms of lower urinary tract obstruction and bedwetting. However, we considered the possibility of a relationship of this mass with the right kidney agenesis, because of its location in the same area of the missing right ureteric orifice, so we decided to perform transvesical surgery rather than transurethral surgery.
Transvesical access found a round-shaped mass, 24 × 20 mm in size, located on the right extremity of the interureteric ridge, covered by normal mucous membrane of the bladder. This mass was located close to the bladder neck and was protruding into the internal urethral meatus (Fig. ). We discovered that it was attached to the bladder wall. Excision of the bladder mass was performed. During surgery, multiple cystic masses containing dark-brown liquid were excised. The integrity of the urinary bladder wall was restored. The urinary bladder was drained by a size 16 Foley urethral catheter.
After removing the urethral catheter (at 48 h), our patient was free from her symptoms of bedwetting, difficulty in starting the stream of urine, and intermittent interruption of the urinary stream while voiding.
In order to study the tissue with a light microscope, the specimen was fixed in formalin (10%), cut into sections of 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. At histology (Figs. , , , , , , and ), malformation of renal structures typical of rudimentary multicystic dysplastic kidney was observed: a tubular structure lined with cubic epithelium, dilated distal tubules and collecting ducts with their transformation into stretched cysts; disorganized structures of renal calyces and pelvis that transformed into the cysts; atrophy of renal tubules; thickening of the basement membrane, resembling wall of cysts; malformed glomeruli and tubules are lacking proper organization, interstitial and periglomerular fibrosis, and nonspecific cellular infiltration.
At 3 year, 8.5 month follow-up of the patient, she had no recurrence of bedwetting, difficulty in starting the stream of urine or intermittent interruption of the urinary stream while voiding. She was followed up with clinical and radiological examinations. Retrograde cystogram (February 1, 2018) showed normal urinary bladder, no cystic mass was seen (Fig. ).","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [14, 'years'], 'creatinine': [90.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Female'}",85.856,81.563,90.149,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 14 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 90.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 90.0 µmol. To convert 90.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 90.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 9e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 9e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.01 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.01 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.01 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 10.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 10.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 90.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.0/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**14 * 1.012 = 85.856.

Anti-mitochondrial antibody assay, HFE gene mutation analysis, ceruloplasmin, viral hepatitis panel, alpha-1 antitrypsin level and anti-smooth muscle antibody assay were sent to evaluate the elevated liver enzymes and were negative. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) did not reveal any biliary pathology. A bedside swallow evaluation revealed oropharyngeal dysphagia and X-ray of the hands revealed juxta-articular osteopenia (Figure ).

Neurologic electrophysiology studies showed normal nerve conduction, fibrillation and positive waves in all muscles and low amplitude motor unit action potentials in the majority of the muscles studied, particularly in the proximal muscles. In summary, it showed electrophysiologic evidence of a diffuse myopathy with features of muscle membrane irritability. A subsequent muscle biopsy revealed atrophic fibers with a perimysial distribution (as seen in Figure ), increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 (as seen in Figure ), and capillary complement staining (as seen in Figure ), suggesting an autoimmune myositis. There were no features to suggest autoimmune hepatitis.

He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day, and drinks socially.
He had no significant social and environmental history. His medication list included amlodipine, allopurinol, ferric citrate hydrate, and lansoprazole. He had no family history of cardiovascular diseases.
He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 114/50 mmHg and a regular pulse rate of 61 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation was 96% on ambient air. There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmur, and abdominal tenderness. His neurological examinations were unremarkable. Blood investigations showed: hemoglobin 14.0 mg/dl, white blood cells 4700/mm3, and platelets 134,000/mm3. His liver and renal function tests revealed total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 24 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 34 IU/l, blood urea nitrogen 54.2 mg/dl, and serum creatinine 11.1 mg/dL. His C-reactive protein was 0.16 mg/dl. His serum electrolyte tests were within normal limits, including calcium and inorganic phosphorus. In addition, his brain natriuretic peptide was raised at 605.1 pg/dl. His blood cultures were negative.
A chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion (Fig. ). An electrocardiogram suggested left ventricular hypertrophy with nonspecific ST-T wave changes (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed MAC and a highly mobile mass (8 × 6 mm) attached to the ventricular side of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (Fig. ). The echogenicity of the mass was similar to MAC. The mitral valve was mildly thickened with mild mitral stenosis. Left ventricular systolic function was normal. Cardiac computed tomography demonstrated a calcified cardiac mass in the mitral annulus with heavy MAC (Fig. ). As the mass was highly mobile, suggesting a high risk of embolization, he underwent surgical resection of the mass. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a severely calcified mitral annulus and attachment of the calcific mass to the P2 segment of the mitral valve. Surgical resection was performed successfully.
Macroscopic findings of the resected mass showed a yellowish colored and partially calcified mass (7 mm in diameter; Fig. ). A histopathological examination revealed multiple nodular amorphous calcifications and fibrous connective tissue. There were no identifiable myxoma or malignancy cells (Fig. ).

The patient was having difficulty breathing (Fig. ).
She was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a mother who was unaware of the date of her last menstrual period. She had no prenatal medical care, so there was no opportunity for prenatal diagnosis.
Initial examination revealed a mass that occupied the majority of the oral cavity and protruded from the mouth. On palpation, the mass appeared to arise from one side of the palate, and there was an adjacent palpable cleft. No other congenital anomalies were evident on physical examination.
The patient had some breathing difficulty, but the airway was patent. She was administered oxygen and intravenous fluids, and a nasogastric feeding tube was successfully placed. Feeding was commenced at 35 ml, eight times per day, and she stabilized.
On day 5, she was taken to surgery. Laryngoscopy was performed using a standard Macintosh blade size 1, and an easy intubation with a 2.5 endotracheal tube. The mass was excised under general anesthesia, Good hemostasis was achieved, and complete resection of the tumor was accomplished. There were no immediate postoperative complications.
Gross examination revealed a large fibrocystic tumor involving the oral and nasal cavities with its base originating from the hard palate. It measured 6 × 5 × 4.5 cm and was well circumscribed (Fig. ).
Histopathologic examination revealed a congenital primarily epidermal teratoma.
She had an uneventful postoperative course, although a palatal defect remained (Fig. ). She had no difficulty opening or closing her mouth. Bottle feeding with expressed breast milk was initiated shortly after surgery and was well tolerated. She was able to breastfeed by postoperative day 5.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 13.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 13.0 mEq/L) = 26.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 26.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 26.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 26.0 - 12 = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 14.0 mEq/L.

hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented to the emergency department
with altered mental status. Her family reported that she had been feeling unwell for
3 days. Her symptoms subsequently progressed to altered mentation and dyspnea. In
the emergency department, initial vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 °C,
heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/72 mm Hg, respiratory rate
of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical
examination, the patient was confused and agitated. She was tachypneic and
tachycardic on heart and lung examination. Laboratory tests () revealed leukocytosis with a
white blood cell count of 19.9 × 109/L, absolute neutrophils of 89.3%,
and a platelet count of 507 × 109/L. The basic metabolic panel revealed a
sodium level of 131 mmol/L, potassium of 6.2 mmol/L, chloride of 104 mmol/L, total
CO2 of 6, glucose level >38.8 mmol/L, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) of
25 mmol/L, creatinine of 362.5 µmol/L, high anion gap of 28, and acetone was large.
Arterial blood gas revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory
respiratory alkalosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was
unremarkable. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and insulin infusion and
was transferred to the intensive care unit to manage DKA and acute kidney
injury.
In the intensive care unit, the patient’s DKA resolved, and altered mentation
improved significantly over 3 days; however, her renal function progressively
worsened. Her BUN and serum creatinine continued to trend up, and she became
oliguric. Given these changes, an Udall catheter was placed for hemodialysis. Of
note, the patient had a creatinine level of 88 µmol/L and BUN of 3.6 mmol/L on her
outpatient blood work 2 months before this presentation.
In the days following treatment, the patient became febrile, with a
Tmax of 39.1 °C and tachycardic, but she remained
hemodynamically stable. A septic workup was performed, and empiric broad-spectrum
antibiotics were started along with antipyretics. Blood cultures grew K
pneumoniae. Ultimately, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral
contrast showed several hypoattenuating hepatic lesions and heterogeneous splenic
hyperattenuation concerning for splenic infarcts. Magnetic resonance imaging of the
abdomen and pelvis to further characterize these lesions revealed about 8 lesions in
the left hepatic lobe, with the largest lesion measuring 3.9 × 3.2 × 3.7 cm in size,
within segment 3 of the left hepatic lobe concerning for hepatic abscess. There were
also numerous ill-defined peripherally located lesions within the spleen concerning
for abscesses. Piperacillin/tazobactam was de-escalated to ceftriaxone along with
metronidazole. Percutaneous drainage of the left hepatic lobe abscess through
Interventional Radiology guidance yielded 30 mL of pus that grew K
pneumoniae as well (see and ).
The patient’s overall condition improved, and repeat blood cultures were negative.
Her renal function stabilized, and dialysis was discontinued. A repeat CT scan of
the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening of several ill-defined hypoattenuating
splenic lesions with adjacent perisplenic fluid, which required percutaneous
drainage of the splenic abscesses.
Likewise, her hospital course was complicated by acute right femoral, popliteal, and
peroneal vein deep vein thrombosis, for which she was started on high-range heparin
infusion, which was discontinued after 2 days due to a steep decline in hemoglobin
level. An inferior vena cava filter was subsequently inserted. A colonoscopy
revealed a 15-mm polyp in the cecum and nonbleeding hemorrhoids. Her hemoglobin
level subsequently stabilized following blood transfusions. She continued to improve
clinically on the current antibiotic regimen. Ultimately, she was discharged to
complete a 6-week course of antibiotics through a peripherally inserted central

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 53 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 362.5 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 362.5 µmol. To convert 362.5 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 362.5 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000362 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000362 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.041 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.041 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.041 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 41.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 41.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 4.1 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 362.5 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 4.1 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (4.1/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**53 * 1.012 = 12.391.

She has two sisters, one of whom shares the same diagnosis. The patient’s initial presentation was in the form of a facial papular skin rash. She was 1.5 years of age and living with her parents in her home country of Sudan at the time. At the age of five years, she developed skin nodules and gingival hypertrophy, a skin biopsy was taken and showed a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive myxoid background with scattered spindle cells, confirming the diagnosis of JHF. By her late teenage years, disease progression continued, and bilateral knee and elbow stiffness started emerging.
Upon attending the genetics clinic in Hamad General Hospital (HMC), Doha, Qatar at 20 years of age, she had joint stiffness, multiple masses on her hands and typical skin features. She underwent multiple excision biopsy procedures for the various subcutaneous swelling in her back and was following with the endocrine and gastrointestinal clinics for short stature, vitamin-D deficiency, chronic diarrhea and malabsorption. She was 34 kg in weight and 150 cm in height. DNA testing confirmed the diagnosis of JHF by detection of large homozygous deletions of exons 15 and 16 in the ANTXR2 gene.
In December 2016, the patient had her first encounter with the Plastic Surgery team. She presented with multiple small hard nodules over the forehead, nose, ears and big toe. Patient received local triamcinolone acetonide injections for numerous bilateral hand nodules at that time, and excision of other facial lesions. At one-year follow-up post-surgical removal, no recurrence of the facial lesions was noted. Patient also noted a significant decrease in pain, size, and softening of her hand skin lesions.
In December 2017, two new lesions at the back, each measuring around (8 x 8 x 7 cm), respectively, were excised (Figure ). Histopathology was again consistent with JHF. Post-operative course was smooth, and no recurrence was detected.
In February 2019, the left shoulder subcutaneous mass was increasing in size and the patient had a return of numerous, previously injected hand growths. The lesions were innumerable and local injections would cause significant pain. Hence, a trial of 40 mg oral prednisolone was attempted for one week and then half of the dose over two weeks, followed by a quarter of the original dose over another two weeks. Patient reported a noticeable improvement in pain, the size of lesions and joint stiffness while she was on oral corticosteroid therapy.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 25.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 2.0 mEq/L / -1.0 mEq/L = -2.0. The patient's delta ratio is -2.0."

Two weeks back, he developed generalized tonic clonic convulsion with status epilepticus for the first time. He was then admitted to a nursing home and managed with intravenous diazepam followed by loading dose of phenytoin as per standard protocol. He was discharged with instruction to get intravenous phenytoin (300 mg/day) once daily at home for the next 15 days. There was no history of headache or vomiting. There was no history of respiratory distress, swelling of face, itching, and loose stool. No history of atopy or similar type of episodes seen in other family members.
On examination, the child was conscious but irritable. There was swelling of whole dorsum of tongue, which was protruding outside the mouth with oozing of blood over both the edges of tongue following superadded infection []. The oral cavity was so blocked by edematous tongue that the child could not speak or swallow anything. Face, lips, and gums were normal. His body weight was 24.5 kg, height was 123 cm and head circumference was 45.5 cm. His pulse rate was 144/min, regular, normal volume, respiratory rate 32/min, blood pressure 120/70 mm of Hg, temperature 99.8°F. The child had mild pallor without any pedal edema or cyanosis. Abdomen was soft without any visceromegaly. There was mild respiratory distress due to oro-pharyngeal obstruction. Auscultation of his chest including cardiovascular system was otherwise normal. There was no ataxia, nystagmus, or altered sensorium. However, he had neurologic manifestation of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy with associated complication.
Investigation revealed hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL. Total leukocyte count of 16900/cmm, polymorphs 86%, lymphocytes 12%, platelet counts 2.2 lakhs/cmm, ESR 22/1st hour. Biochemistry showed serum sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 5.2 meq/L, calcium 8.6 mg/dL. Renal function and liver function tests were normal. Chest X-ray and sonography of abdomen did not reveal any abnormality.
Serum C1 esterase inhibitor was 0.62 mg/L (normal: 0.21-0.39 mg/L), which excludes hereditary angioedema. Serum phenytoin level (37.20 μg/ml, toxic range > 20 μg/ml) was elevated.
The child responded to supportive management along with parenteral empirical antibiotics and with intravenous steroids (hydrocortisone), antihistamines, and epinephrine within 2 days. Macroglossia due to edema was reduced and the tongue could be repositioned within the oral cavity [].

She was diagnosed as hypertension at a local clinic in 1986 but recieved no antihypertensive medication. She developed headache, nausea and vomiting in Feb, 1990 and was admitted to the department of neurosurgery with diagnosis of Rt. cerebellar hemorrhage. After discharge, she has been followed for treatment of hypertension. During the follow-up period, she was found to have the Cushingoid features and transferred to the Department of Internal Medicine for the evaluation of Cushing’s syndrome.
The family and other past medical history were not contributory.
On admission, blood pressure was 150/110 mmHg, pulse rate 78/min, body temperature 36.5°C, respiration rate 18/min and height was 164cm and body weight was 77kg.
On physical examination, she was shown to have central obesity. Her face was round and plethoric. She had pink conjunctivae and white sclerae.
On auscultation of the chest, breathing sounds were normal and the heart sound was regular without murmur. On examination of the abdomen, she was found to have striae. Further examination revealed no abnormal finding.
Laboratory studies included hemoglobin 12.7g/dl, WBC 6700/mm3 with 75% neutrophils and 23% lymphocytes, platelet 261,000/mm3, total protein 7.2g/dl, albumin 4.2g/dl, total bilirubin 0.7mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.3mg/dl, ALT 17unit, AST 19 unit, alkaline phosphatase 65U/L, BUN 20mg/dl and creatinine 1.1mg/dl. The concentrations of Na, K, CI and Ca were normal. FBS was 116mg/dl and HbA1c was 3.1%. Urinalysis was normal.
The results of low and high dose dexamethasone suppression test were shown in .
Chest PA and skull series revealed no abnormal findings.
By her history and physical examination, we suspect she had Cushing’s syndrome and then measured 24hr urine free cortisol and performed low dose dexamethasone suppression test. After this study, high dose dexamethasone suppression test was done to differentiate the etiology of Cushing’s syndrome. The levels of plasma cortisol were not suppressed and plasma ACTH level was very low. Abdominal CT scanning was done under the impression of adrenocortical tumor but revealed no abnormal mass in the adreanal gland first. Therefore we performed pituitary fossa MRI to rule out Cushing’s disease associated with micronodular adrenal hyperplasia. MRI reveals atrophic pituitary gland with empty sella. At that time, we didn’t decide the treatment modality for this patient because of poor general condition.
Instead, follow-up study was recommended. Follow-up abdominal CT scan, 3 years after the first study, revealed 2cm-sized hypodense mass in the upper pole of lt, adrenal gland (). So, explorative laparotomy was done under the impression of lt, adrenal adenoma. At operation field, no abnormal adrenal mass was found but the surgeon performed lt, adrenalectomy. The cut surface of surgical specimen showed multiple black pigmented nodules with pale atrophic cortex ().
On the microscopic finding, pigmented micronodular dysplasia with cortical atrophy was found (, ).
After operation, her blood pressure was normalized, and follow-up hormonal levels were also improved.
We concluded that her Cushing’s syndrome resulted from primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease and we plan the contralateral adrenalectomy.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [77.0, 'kg']}",117.0,111.15,122.85,"The patient's weight is 77.0 kg.

At presentation, the patient was unable to tolerate oral intake other than minimal amounts of water. There was a 13-kg weight loss over this 3-month period (weight 79 kg at presentation).
Gastroenterology work up was undertaken shortly after the onset of symptoms. Endoscopy at that time showed non-specific duodenitis, with biopsies taken from the gastric antrum and body as well as the duodenum. Gastric mucosa showed a mild-to-moderate increase in chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria with few focal polymorphs. Helicobacter pylori were present. No epithelial dysplasia or malignancy was reported. Duodenal biopsy showed no evidence of increased lymphocytes, parasites, dysplasia or malignancy. Triple therapy was initiated to eradicate H. pylori. CT did not reveal any abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms improved with eradication therapy. While subsequently on holiday in Taiwan the symptoms returned, prompting further investigation. Endoscopy identified a possible submucosal lesion in the duodenum. Endoscopic ultrasound suggested a duodenal lesion (suboptimal study). Inflammatory markers were raised at this point. As the patient remained unwell, he returned to New Zealand for further evaluation in our centre.
The patient was a previously well non-smoker, with no significant medical or surgical history, taking only omeprazole (prescribed during the prior work up). There was a family history of Crohn's disease in a maternal aunt.
On admission, the patient was haemodynamically normal, oliguric and afebrile with mild peripheral oedema. Abdominal examination revealed a soft, non-tender abdomen with no masses.
On admission C-reactive protein was 19, with a normal white cell count (8.56 × 109/l). The patient was noted to be hypokalaemic. IV fluids were given initially, and on Day 3 of admission, a nasojejunal tube was placed endoscopically for enteric feeding. Endoscopy revealed a clear fluid in the gastric body, with acquired stenosis noted in the duodenal bulb, which was biopsied. Endoscopic images are shown in Fig. .
Biopsy revealed non-specific inflammation, with Brunner gland hyperplasia and foveolar metaplasia, reported as non-specific peptic duodenitis with no malignancy identified. Repeat endoscopy 3 days later reported malignant looking severe stenosis of the prepyloric region. Endoscopic images are shown in Fig. . No biopsy was taken at this time.
Endoscopic ultrasound was undertaken on Day 8 of admission, which showed generalized thickening of the prepyloric deep mucosa with no discreet mass. Biopsy again showed non-specific inflammation without evidence of granuloma or malignancy. After discussion with a multidisciplinary team and subsequently with the patient and family, a decision was made for distal gastrectomy. On Day 16 of admission, the patient underwent a Billroth II distal gastrectomy with retrocolic gastrojejunostomy. During the operation, a nodular lesion was noted in the pylorus which did not appear to involve the duodenum. Several small lymph nodes were identified. No other abdominal abnormalities were observed. On Day 7 post-operatively, a histological diagnosis was made of Crohn's disease of the stomach, involving the duodenum. Histopathological images are shown in Fig. .
The patient was discharged 14 days after the operation when he was able to tolerate adequate oral intake for nutritional need. Subsequent anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies testing was positive for both IgG (66 units/ml) and IgA (171 units/ml). The patient was subsequently started on azathioprine.

Two months ago, the patient had presented to our hospital with left lower quadrant pain and nonbloody diarrhea and dizziness. A Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis had revealed pancolitis and she was treated with antibiotics. At that time she was also found to have proteinuria, pedal edema and photosensitive rash on her face. The proteinuria was attributed to glomerular disease of unclear etiology. Autoimmune work-up revealed positive ANA, anti-Smith Ab, and anti-RNP. Parvovirus IgG was also positive. She was found to have pancytopenia and the diagnosis of aplastic anemia was considered and she was transferred to another tertiary care hospital. There, she underwent a renal biopsy that revealed focal proliferative and membranous lupus nephritis classes 3 and 5. She was discharged on prednisone, mycophenolate, and hydroxychloroquine. Now she had presented with the current complains.
In the ER she was found to be lethargic. On physical examination, her temperature was 97.5°F, pulse was 102 beats per minute, the initial blood pressure was 136/79 mm of Hg, and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. There was no scleral icterus. Oral mucosa was dry without visible lesions. The neck was supple. Skin was warm and had desquamating rash on both lower extremities from hip down (). The rash was nonblanching and erythematous, and Nicolsky sign was positive. The abdomen was soft but mild tenderness was noted in the epigastric region without any guarding or rebound tenderness. There was no organomegaly and the bowel sounds were sluggish. There was bilateral pitting pedal edema. The patient was arousable with verbal and tactile stimulation and was moving all extremities spontaneously. Rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Later she developed hypotension and was given on intravenous fluids. Sepsis was suspected and broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The early differential diagnosis included Steven Johnson syndrome vs. necrotizing fasciitis causing sepsis. Her labs revealed severe pancytopenia and severe metabolic acidosis. Detailed results of the laboratory parameters are given in .
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of platelets. Within an hour of arrival to the ER she developed acute respiratory failure and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She developed septic shock requiring vasopressors. She was deemed too unstable for imaging studies but a portable chest X-ray revealed right basilar atelectasis and portable X-ray of the lower extremities showed soft tissue edema. Four hours after the initial presentation she developed asystole and expired after failed resuscitative measures.

She reported subjective fever with rigors and chills, loose, watery stools and abdominal fullness. Her past medical history was significant for chronic alcoholism; she drank 6–8 beers each day. She had no reported history of cirrhosis.
On arrival, her vitals included blood pressure: 120/88 mmHg, pulse:80/minute, respiratory rate:18/minute, temperature:98.6 ºF and oxygen saturation: 97% on ambient air. She appeared in mild distress; sclera was slightly jaundiced. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. The abdomen was mildly tender in the epigastric area without guarding and rigidity. Hepatomegaly was also noted. Central nervous system examination was non-focal. Skin showed no erythematous lesions.

Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed severe, circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with the involvement of distal esophagus and the first portion of the duodenum in addition to perigastric stranding; findings were reported to be consistent with severe gastritis (). There was also mild mucosal thickening of the transverse and descending colon. The liver was enlarged with fatty infiltration. A small amount of ascites with small left-sided pleural effusion was seen throughout the peritoneum. No obstruction, perforation or intrabdominal abscess was seen. Based on her subtle presentation, physical exam and hemodynamic stability, primary peritonitis was deemed less likely upon initial assessment. Therefore, she was admitted to a medical floor with the provisional diagnoses of alcohol-related gastritis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute kidney injury. She received a 2-litre bolus of intravenous (IV) normal saline and was started on maintenance fluid, IV antiemetics, and IV pantoprazole.
Within 8-hours of admission, the patient became hemodynamically unstable with subsequent intubation and fluid resuscitation. She was transferred to the intensive care unit. Because of bright red blood on nasogastric decompression, she was started on IV octreotide given her history of chronic alcoholism and possible variceal bleed. Because of hypotension and SIRS with peritoneal ascites, blood cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin). A diagnostic paracentesis was performed obtaining 1.2 liters of thick serosanguinous peritoneal fluid. Ascitic fluid analysis was suggestive of monomicrobial primary peritonitis, showing abundant Gram-positive cocci and 51,500 leucocytes/mm3 with 67% neutrophils. Ascitic fluid was exudative in nature with total protein 3.8 g/dl, albumin 1.6 g/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 5189/UL and glucose 56 mg/dl. Serum-albumin ascitic-albumin gradient was 0.9 g/dl.
No surgical intervention was considered as the possibility of secondary peritonitis was less likely based on her CT and ascitic fluid findings. Blood cultures and ascitic fluid cultures were positive for GAS, and therefore, the patient was started on IV ampicillin and clindamycin for primary GAS peritonitis.
Because of hematemesis, the patient underwent EGD that showed diffuse gastric ulcerations, but no esophageal varices or active bleeding. Given diffuse ulceration of stomach with circumferential wall thickening, gastritis was thought to be caused by an underlying ischemic or infiltrative process.
Although the patient’s hemoglobin was stable, and she had required no blood transfusions, her hemodynamic status started to deteriorate requiring multiple pressor support and IV high-dose hydrocortisone. Given the context of isolation of GAS from blood and ascitic fluid, septic shock and multiorgan failure (renal failure and liver failure), a diagnosis of STSS was made. Her lactic acid level worsened from 2.8 at baseline to 42 mM/L. The patient was deemed a non-surgical candidate by the surgical team. However, an ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal drain was placed for therapeutic reasons. The patient received few doses of antibiotics; however, she continued to deteriorate and succumbed to death within 48-hours of admission due to cardiopulmonary arrest and multiorgan failure.",What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [94.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [2.5, 'g/dL'], 'Bicarbonate': [18.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [129.0, 'mmol/L']}",20.75,19.712,21.788,"The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 129.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 94.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 94.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 94.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 94.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 94.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 94.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L - (94.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 17.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 17.0 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 2.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 17.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.5 (in g/dL)) = 20.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 20.75 mEq/L."

Other laboratory findings, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE PRIST, C3, C4, CH50, rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antistreptolysin-O (ASO), VDRL and cold cryoglobulin, were all negative.
Despite empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroid treatment, dyspnea progressively aggravated. Open lung biopsy was done on the tenth hospital day. Histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen showed large areas of necrotizing pneumonia with an infarct-like appearance (). There were some scattered fungal hyphae within the lung parenchyma (). The bronchi and bronchioles often showed dilated lumen which were filled with mucus, numerous necrotic debris, inflammatory cells and branching septated hyphae characteristic of aspergillus. Some terminal bronchioles were found to be destroyed and were replaced by granulomatous inflammation (). The bronchocentric granulomatous reaction extended into the adjacent lung parenchyma to a degree. Gomori-Methenamine-Silver (GMS) staining revealed many fungal hyphae consistent with aspergillus species. There was no evidence of angioinvasion by aspergillus or aspergillous emboli. With an impression of invasive aspergillus infection with BCG-like elements, 15 mg of amphotericin-B once day was administered intravenously and the dose was increased up to 30 mg daily. Steroids was tapered progressively. There were some improvement in her clinical symptoms. However despite vigorous antifungal treatment, sudden respiratory arrest occurred due to acute tracheobronchial tree obstruction with bronchial casts on the thirty-fourth hospital day. Histopathologic examination of the casts revealed fibrinoid necrotic tissue containing neutrophils, a few metaplastic squamous cell nests and variably fragmented fungal hyphae ().",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [37.2, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [110.0, 'beats per minute'], 'PaCO₂': [42.5, 'mm hg'], 'respiratory rate': [24.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [48220.0, 'µL']}",3,3,3,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 110.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 48220.0 count/µL. To convert 48220.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 48220.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 48220000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 24.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 42.5 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3."

Her past history was unremarkable except for the presence of contact allergy to metal, and she had never undergone an anesthesia procedure previously. Her height was 164 cm, and weight was 79 kg. An epidural catheter was placed before anesthesia induction. Povidone iodine was used for skin disinfection, and mepivacaine 0.5% was used for skin infiltration of local anesthetics. During and after placement of the epidural catheter, the patient's condition was stable. General anesthesia was induced by propofol 150 mg, and continuous infusion of remifentanil 0.3 μg/kg/min and rocuronium 50 mg was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of remifentanil and desflurane. After administration of rocuronium, her entire body began to flush. Even though tracheal intubation was uneventful, the anesthesiologist felt very high resistance during manual bag ventilation. Peak airway pressure increased to 37 cm·H2O with a tidal volume of approximately 170 ml. The value of end tidal carbon dioxide tension was approximately 17 mmHg. Her systolic blood pressure decreased to 40 mmHg, and heart rate increased to 170 bpm. Because anaphylactic reaction was suspected, hydrocortisone 300 mg was administered intravenously, and epinephrine 0.2 mg was administered intramuscularly. Starting at about five minutes after administration of epinephrine, the peak airway pressure gradually decreased to 20 cm·H2O, and skin flushing seemed to decrease. Her blood pressure and heart rate stabilized to 100 mmHg of systolic blood pressure and 90 bpm of heart rate. Surgery was cancelled. Thirty minutes after recovery from shock state, the train-of-four ratio by neuromuscular monitoring returned to over 90%, and the patient regained consciousness. Her trachea was extubated. We did not measure the serum tryptase level because its measurement is not available at our hospital.
A dermatologist was consulted and skin testing including the SPT and IDT for rocuronium, vecuronium, propofol, mepivacaine, and midazolam was scheduled. The skin prick test using administration of histamine as a positive control and saline as a negative control was undertaken in the operating room by the dermatologist. The concentrations of the test drugs used in the SPT and IDT are shown in . All drugs diluted to 1 : 100 in the SPT resulted in no reaction. However, among undiluted agents in the SPT, only rocuronium presented enlargement of flare and wheal, which indicated a positive allergic reaction. Other drugs did not present a positive reaction. The next day, the intradermal skin test was performed to identify whether cross-reaction between rocuronium and vecuronium could be observed. Only vecuronium was examined. Vecuronium, diluted at 1 : 1000, 1 : 100, and 1 : 10, was tested at 20 minute intervals, and no positive reaction was found at any dilution.
Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy was rescheduled after one month. General anesthesia using vecuronium was safely performed. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient is doing well.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [79.0, 'kg'], 'height': [164.0, 'cm']}",65.202,61.942,68.462,"The patient's gender is Female.

The patient had received acupuncture 28 years ago to treat persistent epigastralgia. Three weeks thereafter, her mother noticed slight icterus of her skin. One year later, when she was 35 years old, a test in another hospital revealed that her transaminases levels were rising. The peak of alanine transaminase (ALT) reached as high as about 280 IU/L. When she was 38 years old, her home doctor began to inject 60 mL of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (it is usually used to lower serum transaminase) twice a week. This was continued for several years. However, her transaminases were unstable. She was told that HCV antibody was positive at that time. She did not receive IFN therapy (including PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy). This was her first IFN-free DAA treatment, which is a standard therapy available in Japan for chronic HCV infection.
Table shows the laboratory data at the beginning of the therapy and at the time of gingival bleeding (at the same time of inflammation of the genital vulva). The abnormal data at the beginning were as follows; serum alanine transaminase was 46 U/L, alkaline phosphatase was 389 U/L, total cholesterol was 114 mg/dL, and HCV-RNA was 3.6 logIU/mL of the viral load (real-time PCR). HCV was of the 1b type.
Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a normal-sized liver with a regular liver surface and no marked splenomegaly. Moreover, the architecture of the liver in ultrasonography was rough, suggesting chronic hepatitis.

Interestingly, she experienced the sensation of being hungry from the beginning of the therapy. She became hungry 2 h after each meal, and took 5 meals every day. Severe gingivitis and gingival bleeding occurred from 3 weeks after the beginning of the therapy and it lasted for about 10 days. She felt instability of the gingiva and pain on biting foods. At the same time, she felt severe burning of the throat. Simultaneously, she developed inflammation of the genital vulva (redness and edematous swelling) and also it lasted about 10 days.

She was diagnosed with hypertension and had been taking an angiotensin receptor blocker for 2 years, with no other home medications. The patient's preoperative electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 55 beats/min and no associated clinical symptoms such as dizziness or syncope. No abnormalities were observed on preoperative chest radiography and routine laboratory examinations. The day before surgery, her mean blood pressure and pulse rate were 136/71 mmHg and 54 beats/min, respectively. The patient received no premedication, and standard monitoring was performed. An electrocardiogram before the induction of anesthesia showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 58 beats/min. Her blood pressure was 140/78 mmHg and oxygen saturation was 99% on pulse oximetry. General anesthesia was induced with a target-controlled intravenous infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Nasotracheal intubation was performed after administration of intravenous rocuronium (40 mg). General anesthesia was maintained with propofol (with a target effect-site concentration of 3–4 µg/mL) and remifentanil (with a target effect-site concentration of 3.5–4.5 ng/mL) to achieve a bispectral index of 40–55. Ventilation was controlled to achieve an end-tidal CO2 partial pressure of 35–45 mmHg with a mixture of O2 and air. After induction of anesthesia, the electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 61 beats/min, and the patient's noninvasive blood pressure was 111/63 mmHg.
At 20 min after the induction of anesthesia, we administered a local infiltration of 8 mL of 1% lidocaine (10 mg/mL) combined with 1:100,000 epinephrine (10 µg/mL) before the surgical incision. The inferior alveolar nerve block was performed first, and submucosal infiltration was administered to the depth of the mucobuccal fold and around the lesion. All injections were administered after aspiration and completed in around 3–4 min. At 5 min after the infiltration of lidocaine containing epinephrine, the electrocardiogram revealed an accelerated junctional rhythm, with a heart rate of 70 beats/min (). The patient's noninvasive systolic blood pressure was 50 mmHg immediately after we noticed the changes in the electrocardiogram. Two, 8-mg intravenous injections of ephedrine were administered. The systolic blood pressure increased to 138 mmHg and remained around 110 mmHg when measured at intervals of 2–3 min for 10 min. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm around 6 min after the onset of the junctional rhythm (). There were no significant changes in other parameters—such as oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, and peak airway pressure—while the patient exhibited arrhythmias and hypotension.
There were no further significant blood pressure changes or arrhythmias until the end of the surgery, which was 55 min in duration. Tracheal extubation was performed when the patient could respond to verbal commands, and she exhibited adequate spontaneous ventilation after administration of sugammadex. She blood pressure was normal and there were no abnormal electrocardiogram findings during her stay in the postanesthesia care unit.

There was a soft systolic murmur in the right upper sternal border. Pulsation on dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery and sensation on right lower extremity was decreased. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm and ST elevation in anterior precordial leads with ST depression in leads I and aVL (Figure ). Pertinent labs revealed initial troponin-I of 0.05 ng/ml. The remaining blood work, including complete blood count and the basic metabolic panel, was unremarkable.
In the emergency department, the patient received immediate dual antiplatelet therapy, and cutaneous pacer pads were applied. Due to the focal exam findings, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed rapidly with quick review ruling out dissection. CTA however revealed a small transverse, linear defect in the proximal aorta (Figure ). This defect was noted to propagate towards the root of the aortic valve on its anterior leaflet suggesting possible vegetation on the aortic valve. Given the ST changes and ongoing chest pain, the patient was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed a distal thrombus in the posterior left ventricular branch of the right coronary artery which was not amenable for intervention (Figures , ). During cardiac catheterization, right lower extremity pain and coolness suddenly worsened. Angiogram of the right lower extremity showed 100% occlusion of the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ).

The patient's abdominal CT scan showed massive distention of the stomach () with a cluster of air-filled sacs compatible with PI affecting the sigmoid colon and the intestine () and no free air or signs of acute sigmoid volvulus (SV).
Upper endoscopy was performed for diagnosis and gastric decompression purposes. It showed a copious amount of fluids in the stomach with considerable gastric distention; however, it was very difficult to proceed with endoscopy, and surgical decompression was recommended. After initial resuscitation, the patient was then taken to the operating room. The stomach was severely distended with signs of fibrotic pyloric mass. The sigmoid colon was remarkably redundant. There were findings of chronic sigmoid volvulus with a twisted sigmoid mesentery. PI was apparent externally and covering the entire sigmoid colon; however, there were no signs of perforation. Another extensive PCI disease was found covering the ileum () but without other intraoperative abnormalities. Partial distal gastrectomy, vagotomy, and Billroth II reconstruction were performed, and the intraoperative frozen section was negative for malignancy. The patient then also underwent a sigmoid resection (Figures and ) with primary anastomosis of the descending colon and the rectum. Postoperatively, the patient's diet was slowly advanced; he was discharged on the sixth postoperative day with unremarkable recovery period up to a 3-month follow-up.
The final histopathology on the surgically resected specimens revealed benign fibrotic stenotic pylorus with extensive PI involving the sigmoid colon.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [36.5, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [98.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [20.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [12000.0, 'µL']}",2,2,2,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 98.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 12000.0 count/µL. To convert 12000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 12000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 12000000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2."

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [70.0, 'kg'], 'height': [170.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.6, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [40, 'years']}",152.632,145.0,160.264,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 40 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 170.0 cm, which is 170.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.7 m. The patient's weight is 70.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 70.0 kg / (1.7 m * 1.7 m) = 24.221 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.2, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 65.937 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 40) * 65.937 * 1) / (0.6 * 72) = 152.632 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 152.632 mL/min."
8082,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-5046051-1,Extracted,"We present the case of a 49-year-old female with restricting-type anorexia nervosa who was voluntary admitted for treatment at the Villa Garda Hospital Eating Disorder Unit, Italy, on 21 December 2015. The treatment based on an adapted inpatient version of CBT-E—an enhanced form of CBT designed to treat patients with eating disorder psychopathology—has a standard duration of 20 weeks, comprising 13 weeks of inpatient therapy followed by 7 weeks of day hospital [, ].
The patient reported no psychiatric disorders nor family history for eating disorders or any other significant psychiatric conditions. Her eating disorder had begun at the age of 30 years, when she had a body weight of 49 kg and a body mass index (BMI) of 19.6 kg/m2. After the death of her mother, the patient adopted a strict diet and excessive exercising (i.e., walking for long distances for a duration of 4-5 hours a day), which determined a progressive weight loss of about 10 kg over a few months and the onset of secondary amenorrhoea. In the years that followed the patient maintained a body weight of around 39 kg through extreme and rigid dietary rules and excessive daily exercising. At the age of 48 years, following the loss of her job and the breakup of a relationship, the patient stepped up both her dietary restriction and the duration of exercising and lost roughly 6 kg over the course of one year. At this point she was referred by her general practitioner to our eating disorder unit, which, after an initial assessment and consultation, she agreed to attend as an inpatient.
At admission the patient had a body weight of 33 kg, height of 1.57 m, and BMI of 13.4 kg/m2 as well as an oral temperature of 35.2°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, with no evidence of orthostatic changes. Her eating disorder psychopathology, assessed using the Italian version of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE.170D) [], was characterized by overvaluation of eating control, severe dietary restriction, and excessive exercising (about 4 to 5 hours of walking) so as to interfere with weight gain. The patient reported a persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of her current low body weight and no episodes of binge eating or purging behaviours (i.e., self-induced vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse) over the past three months. Her EDE global score was 1.83, which is slightly higher than 1 standard deviation (SD) above the community mean (i.e., above 1.74) [].
Laboratory tests at admission, before refeeding commenced, showed marked reductions in natremia (123 mEq/L; normal range 136–144 mEq/L) and chloremia (89 mEq/L; normal range 101–111 mEq/L) and very high values of serum creatine kinase (3,238 IU/L; normal values: 38–234 IU/L). In association with the high serum creatine kinase levels, the patient also reported generalised skeletal pain, which was judged to be compatible with muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis due to excessive exercising.
At physical examination, the patient displayed no clinical signs of dehydration or distress (i.e., neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, etc.) and neither her blood pressure nor her pulse rate increased when passing from a clinostatic to an orthostatic position. This, in association with her normal blood haemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin, total protein, urea nitrogen, and creatinine values and the absence of reported self-induced vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse, was taken as indicative of nonhypovolemic hyponatremia []. Her urine specific gravity (1.011; normal range 1.005–1.030) was within the normal range and the serum osmolality (256 mOsm/kgH2O; normal range 275–295 mOsm/kg) was suggestive of the diagnosis of hypoosmolar hyponatremia [].
The medical team judged the patient to be at a high risk of severe complications (i.e., cerebral and pulmonary oedema and acute renal failure) of hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis secondary to excessive exercising, concluding that the best treatment option was inpatient CBT-E to address the patient's eating disorder psychopathology, including her excessive exercising, with some minor adaptations to treat the associated medical comorbidity.
In brief, inpatient CBT-E, described in detail elsewhere, has four main goals [, ]: (i) to engage the patient in treatment and change; (ii) to remove the eating disorder psychopathology; (iii) to correct the mechanisms responsible for maintaining the psychopathology; and (iv) to ensure the changes brought about are lasting. In this specific case, a major focus of the first part of the treatment was to help the patient to see the need to interrupt her excessive exercising, accept rest, and avoid movement, a strategy that would simultaneously manage her eating disorder psychopathology, rhabdomyolysis, and exercise-associated hyponatremia. To encourage the patient to make the decision to interrupt excessive exercising herself (rather than have it imposed on her), a fundamental principle of CBT-E, the patient was educated about the adverse effect of excessive exercising. We informed her that such behaviour was a potent maintenance mechanism of her eating disorder psychopathology [] and current conditions, interfering with weight regain, likely underlying her muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis [], and hyponatremia [], and potentially causing overuse injuries, fractures, and adverse cardiac events, not to mention taking up time that could be used in other, more positive ways (e.g., doing enjoyable things with others).
As part of the engagement process, the patient was then involved in drawing up a personalized formulation including the main expressions of her eating disorder psychopathology (i.e., overvaluation of eating control, strict diet, excessive exercising, and low body weight) and the main mechanisms maintaining them. We then discussed with her the implications of the formulation on her treatment, the effects of her overvaluation of eating control, dietary restriction, and weight regain, and, in particular, the need for immediate interruption of exercising for skeletal healing and normalising exercise-associated hyponatremia. The patient was then assisted in creating a table outlining the “Pros and Cons of Change” and evaluating her reasons for and against excessive exercising. Since the patient remained reluctant to rest, we suggest that she try to stop exercising on a trial basis, which she voluntarily agreed to do, adopting a more collaborative approach. A similar procedure, described in detail in previous publications [, ], was used to help the patient to see her low weight as a problem and make the decision to address weight regain.
In order to manage her acute medical conditions, the patient was offered a two-week protocol that included the following strategies and procedures:Careful supervised water restriction (1.5 litres per day) to manage the euvolemic hyponatremia. The patient agreed to drink 500 mL water three times a day under a nurse's supervision and to refrain from drinking any more []. Vitamin-B complex supplements to be prescribed for 21 days from the start of feeding to reduce the possibility of Wernicke's encephalopathy [] as a consequence of refeeding syndrome and hyponatremia. Specific cognitive and behavioural procedures strategies to address the patient's excessive exercising, focusing on promoting rest, movement avoidance, and resisting the urge to exercise. These included real-time self-monitoring of the urge to exercise, considering the impulse to exercise as a tolerable temporary phenomenon and undertaking distracting activities with others. The patient was also encouraged to move only when necessary, in order to promote skeletal muscle healing and normalisation of the exercise-associated hyponatremia. Daily physical activity was monitored objectively by means of a SenseWear armband []. A diet plan of 1500 kcal for the first week and then 2000 kcal in the second week, implemented as agreed upon with the patient, who had been informed that adequate caloric intake is highly recommended in muscle injury to promote healing and adequate solute repletion (sodium and protein) []. Daily clinical examinations and regular laboratory tests (2-3 days), conducted during the first two weeks of feeding () to monitor for refeeding syndrome and the potential onset of severe manifestations such as cerebral and/or pulmonary oedema and/or acute renal failure.
The patient was compliant with the protocol, which brought about a rapid improvement in her clinical conditions. Indeed, after only 48 hours, CK levels had been reduced by almost 50% and these normalised within eight days (). This prevented the occurrence of acute renal failure and was accompanied by the remission of muscle pain (). Laboratory tests also showed a gradual increase in serum sodium levels, which rose to normal levels in about 15 days (), thereby preventing the onset of severe hyponatremia-related complications (). The patient, despite being extremely underweight, did not develop any signs of refeeding syndrome ().
Having completed the 13 weeks of inpatient therapy followed by 7 weeks of partial hospitalization, the patient was discharged on 11 May 2016 with a body weight of 48 kg, a BMI of 19.0 kg/m2, and a global EDE score of 0.48, which is less than 1 SD above the community mean (i.e., below 1.74) [].",What is the patient's body surface area?

At the casualty department, bilateral chest tubes were inserted. At presentation, the patient was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26/min, blood pressure was 124/88 mmHg with a heart rate between 125 and 136 beats/min. He was resuscitated with fluids.

The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy with small bowel resection and end-to-end anastomosis at 13 hours posttrauma. Following this, minimally invasive percutaneous instrumentation from T10 to T12 was done. Four percutaneous screws were inserted simultaneously through four stab incisions []. The instrumentation was performed using size 5.5 mm screws for both T10 as well as T12 vertebrae. The duration of the operation was 45 min, with a blood loss of 75 mls (measured by soaked gauze). The screws were inserted simultaneously to reduce the amount of image intensifier exposures required for the procedure.

Three months after the initial visit, multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were detected in segments 7 and 8 of the liver according to the Brisbane 2000 Nomenclature of Liver Anatomy and Resections [], and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed for each HCC. Seventeen months after RFA, a recurrence of HCC was detected in segment 4 (the medial section) by follow-up computed tomography (CT), and the patient was referred to our department.
Physical examination showed that the patient was an 87.9 kg, 168.5 cm male in good condition. The patient received medical treatment for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He had neither a history of transfusion nor a history of SCT. The laboratory test results showed moderate liver damage, as shown in Table . Microscopic examination of peripheral blood erythrocytes did not show any morphological abnormalities.
Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 4.0 × 3.4 × 3.2 cm tumor in segment 4 adjacent to the left branch of the portal vein and the middle hepatic vein (Fig. ). An irregular liver surface; the hypertrophy of segments 1, 2 and 3; and splenomegaly all suggested the presence of cirrhosis. The normal liver parenchyma of the medial section accounted for 10% of the total liver volume according to CT volumetry.
With the diagnosis of solitary HCC in segment 4, left medial sectionectomy was conducted. Hepatic resection was performed with intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) guidance with Pringle’s maneuver (hepatic inflow occlusion time 15–30 min and reperfusion time 5 min; the total blood flow occlusion time was 165 min). Multiple IOUS examinations and inspections of the liver surface revealed no hepatic blood flow impairment during surgery (Fig. ). At the end of the operation, laboratory data showed no conspicuous abnormalities, with total bilirubin (T-Bil) 1.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 316 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 323 IU/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 11.6 g/dL, and prothrombin time (PT)% 52.5%. A drain was inserted along the resected plane of the liver. The operation time was 305 min, and the estimated blood loss was 714 mL. No blood transfusion was performed.
However, the laboratory tests on postoperative day (POD) 1 revealed severe liver damage and acidosis: T-Bil 2.8 mg/dL, AST 9250 IU/L, ALT 6120 IU/L, PT% 20.9%, blood pH 7.29, lactate 6.6 mmol/L, and base excess − 5.4 mmol/L. Figure shows the trends of postoperative laboratory data. The bedside US did not indicate an impairment of hepatic blood perfusion. The drain output was 460 mL/15 h, with serosanguineous appearance. Because his vital signs were stable and it was difficult to identify a cause of the acute severe liver damage, we selected conservative management while performing fresh frozen plasma transfusion. The values of AST and ALT declined gradually, but the level of T-Bil continued to increase, and renal and respiratory dysfunction emerged and subsequently deteriorated; therefore, we initiated continuous hemodiafiltration and plasma exchange under mechanical ventilation. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a slightly heterogeneous enhancement of the liver parenchyma without apparent major vessel occlusion on POD 13 (Fig. a), and diffuse cerebral infarction on POD 16 (Fig. b).
Although clinico-radiological examinations could not identify the cause of acute liver damage, the pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed that the intrahepatic peripheral blood vessels were occluded by sickled erythrocytes (Fig. ). Morphological abnormalities were not found by microscopic examination of the peripheral blood erythrocytes after surgery, but we requested an analysis of the patient’s hemoglobin by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a suspicion of hemoglobinopathy. HPLC demonstrated an abnormal sharp peak indicating the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, which accounted for 34.4% of total hemoglobin (Fig. ). These findings strongly suggested the presence of HbS.

General anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol 200 mg plus fentanyl 100 μg and a size 4 LMA ProtectorTM Airway was placed smoothly in a single attempt by a senior resident. The cuff was inflated with 25 ml of air and the black line indicator on the cuff pilot valve remained within the green zone throughout the surgery. However, we did not check the intra-cuff pressure using manometry. The oropharyngeal leak pressure was 25 cmH2O. The sternal notch test and bubble test were performed after insertion to confirm the placement of the LMA protector []. Anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of sevoflurane and oxygen/air. The patient’s breathing was supported with a pressure support of 8 cmH2O, which generated a tidal volume of 400–450 ml and the maximum minute ventilation attained was 12 L/min with peak pressures of 8–10 cmH2O. He was placed in a supine position with standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitoring for the surgery which lasted for 180 minutes. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient’s vital signs were stable throughout. Postoperatively, the LMA was removed smoothly when he was awake. Moreover, blood stains or minimal secretions were not observed on the device.
At the post anesthesia care unit, the patient complained of difficulty in chewing food and a weird tongue movement. He had no voice changes or altered taste sensation. On examination, the patient’s tongue was seen to be deviated to the left during active protrusion (). All sensations of the tongue were intact and there were no tongue fasciculations or wasting.

Regarding coronary risk factors, apart from diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, she was a smoker of more than two packs of cigarettes daily.
On initial assessment she was drowsy with tachycardia (112 pulses/minute), tachypnoea (28 breaths/minute) and hypotension (85/44 mmHg). A physical examination of her abdomen had normal results. Her initial ECG revealed sinus tachycardia, ST segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads consistent with anterior myocardial infarction, and intraventricular conduction delay (Figure ). A urine dipstick test detected ketones, bedside capillary testing using a glucometer showed high glucose concentrations, and arterial blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.16, carbon dioxide partial pressure = 13 mmHg, oxygen partial pressure = 123 mmHg, bicarbonate concentration = 4 mmol/L, base excess = -24 mmol/L). We provisionally diagnosed diabetic ketoacidosis, possibly precipitated by an acute myocardial infarction.

A bedside cardiac ECG showed no segmental wall motion abnormality and a normal ejection fraction. As there were findings both for (epigastric pain, ECG pattern, presence of three coronary heart disease risk factors) and against the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (young age, normal ECG), we performed coronary angiography in order to exclude anterior acute myocardial infarction, which could lead to severe myocardial damage and possible severe complications (heart failure, among others) if treatment was delayed. During angiography, which revealed normal coronary arteries, ST segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads was still present in her ECG findings.
A repeat biochemical test after three hours showed the following values: sodium = 130 mEq/L, potassium = 4.9 mEq/L, and glucose = 255 mg/dl. A repeat ECG showed a complete resolution of the anteroseptal ST segment elevation and intraventricular conduction delay (Figure ). Her troponin I concentration 12 hours after admission was normal (0.1 μg/L). Our patient subsequently made an uneventful recovery. When she was discharged seven days after, both her ECG and biochemical results were normal.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [676.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [127.0, 'mEq/L']}",140.824,133.783,147.865,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.

She was born at 3.25 kg after full-term gestation with maternal masculinization as sparse hair, acne, enlargement of the nose and a deepened voice, which recovered partially after delivery. She showed congenital anomalies and sought medical treatment several times. She exhibited bilateral facial paralysis with mild cerebellar atrophy on MRI, mandibular deformity, ultrasound-confirmed infantile uterus, labial fusion, and disordered toes (the 4th toes were short and hidden in other toes); she underwent the vulvar plastic operation and excision of the 4th toes before coming to our centre. Since birth, she experienced recurrent otitis media, mild hearing impairment and spontaneous fractures of the humerus or phalanx five times. On physical examination, she presented depressed nasal bridge, underdeveloped nasal alae, pear-shaped nose, short and deep philtrum, remarkable median nodule of the upper lip, high palate, malaligned teeth, micrognathia, low-set and cupped ears without antihelix, single earlobe crease, arachnodactyly, short 4th metacarpals and thenar muscle atrophy.

Her birth weight was 2690 g (50th centile for gestational age), her birth length was 47 cm (25th centile), her head circumference was 32.5 cm (25th centile) and her Apgar score was 9/9. After the birth there were no major concerns, although patent ductus arteriosus and haemodynamically significant atrial septal defect (ASD) had been diagnosed, and pronounced dysmorphic features had been observed. She had upward and slanted palpebral fissures with ptosis of both. This was more pronounced in the left upper palpable. Hypertelorism was also observed and the nose was small in size and saddle-shaped. She had a prominent frontal part of the skull, giving the false impression of macrocrania. Her ears were low-set, asymmetrical, triangular and slightly protuberant. Both lips were accentuated in shape and sometimes stretched in an asymmetrical manner (Figure ). A high-arched palate was also observed. There was evidence of general muscular hypotonia and her developmental milestones were delayed. She sat up without help at 12 months and started walking at 18 months. Her speech development was also late, and only developed after she was three years old. Her social and psychical development were surprisingly good. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain showed hyperintensive changes in the white matter and hypoplastic corpus callosum. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal and there were no convulsions.
At 12 months, she suffered from serious acute pyelonephritis, and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed thereafter. The ultrasound kidney volumes were normal with no major dilatation of the renal pyelon. The endoscopic treatment of the VUR was performed on two occasions. Lastly, after classical surgical treatment, the VUR was successfully treated. At that time, her neurodevelopment was equivalent to that of a 9-month-old infant.
Assessments of the child are being carried out every six months. With the exception of one case of pneumonia and one case of acute laryngitis, no additional health problems had been reported. There were no recurrent urinary tract infections.
The girl is currently 5 years old. She weighs 15.5 kg (10th centile), has a height of 110 cm (50th centile) and a head circumference of 49 cm (10th centile). The dysmorphic features are still prominent. She has lower basic muscle tone, especially in the shoulder muscles and the pelvic girdle. Her muscle strength is fairly good and her reflexes are normal. There are no major problems with fine motorics and there are no abnormal movements or contractures. Her palms, especially hypothenar, are hypoplastic and her fingers are thin. Her foot arches are prominent. Hips incline to internal rotation with knees adduction and inward feet rotation, which has no major impact on her gait. Both renal function and blood pressure are normal. At present, she is preparing for the correction of a congenital heart defect.
She is managed with a team of experts and receives special logopaedic, psychological, and defectological assistance. The girl is motivated, cooperates and strives for success and progress. She is pleasant, friendly, good-natured and no emotional or behavioural problems have been observed. Despite her relatively normal development, a psychological examination (Goodenough Draw, Gessell Drawing Test, Brunet-Lesine scale, Vineland Social Maturity Scale, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - WISC) reveals some cognition deficits and borderline intellectual functioning, requiring specialised help and causing delays in her formal education. She follows and understands simple instructions, speaks in sentences, but her pronunciation is unclear. Her global intelligence quotient is 76 (WISC test). Her social maturity meets the requirements of a 5-year-old child (Vineland Social Maturity Scale).

She had been noticing progressively worsening shortness of breath on exertion without any fever, chills, cough, chest pain, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She did not have any sick contacts and had not travelled anywhere recently.
Upon arrival to the hospital, she was noted to have a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air, and a blood pressure of 161/86 mmHg. Further physical examination revealed a thin and cachectic female who appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. She was noted to have normal heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. A pulmonary examination revealed expiratory wheezing bilaterally without any rales or rhonchi. She did not have rashes or peripheral edema. Due to her respiratory distress she was started on non-invasive ventilatory support in the emergency department (ED), which led to improvement in her respiratory status.
Laboratory investigation revealed a hemoglobin count of 15.1 g/dL (reference range [ref], 12.3-15.3), a peripheral white blood cell count of 21,130 cells/mm3 (ref, 4400-11,300) with a relative neutrophil percentage of 80% (ref, 37%-77%), a platelet count of 301,000/mm3 (ref, 145,000-445,000), a sodium level of 134 mmol/L, a serum creatinine level of 0.30 mg/dL (ref, 0.70-1.5), and a blood urea nitrogen of 8 mg/dL (ref, 9-20).

Due to concerns for development of CAP, sputum cultures, two sets of blood cultures via peripheral blood draw and urinary antigens for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila were obtained. She was started on intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 3 grams every six hours and azithromycin 500 milligrams every 24 hours. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed tree-in-bud opacities along with regions of bronchial wall thickening in the bilateral lower lobes (Figure ).
A sputum Gram stain revealed many Gram-positive rods, rare Gram-positive cocci, less than 10 squamous epithelial cells and greater than 25 white blood cells per low power field. Her blood cultures remained negative and the final sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora. Surprisingly, urinary antigens for both S. pneumoniae and Lp1 returned positive.

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 34 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 3.1 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 174.0 cm, which is 174.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.74 m. The patient's weight is 74.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 74.0 kg / (1.74 m * 1.74 m) = 24.442 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.4, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 69.559 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 34) * 69.559 * 1) / (3.1 * 72) = 33.034 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 33.034 mL/min."

Neurological deficit on presentation was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) with a score of 24. She had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
On general medical evaluation she was alert but disorientated. Her blood pressure was 170/80, serum glucose value 89 mg/dl, and cholesterol 213 mg/dl.
At 12:00 she underwent an emergent brain CT scan, which revealed no hemorrhage and only a mild front left hypodensity in the insular area. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was 8. CT angiogram showed an occlusion of the left M1 trunk, and CT perfusion (CTP) revealed a mismatch among the CBF (cerebral blood flow), MTT (mean transit time), and CBV (cerebral blood volume) maps (Figure ).
All stroke patients arriving at our hospital undergo an emergent brain CT scan, CT angiogram (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP), according to a protocol agreed upon by neurologists and intensivists.
On the basis of the presence of penumbra, the decision was taken to transfer the patient to an angiographic ward.
Because the angiographic suite was busy with other procedures, an angiography was performed 6 h after the onset of symptoms without any change in her clinical condition. It confirmed an occlusion of the main M1 trunk with excellent collateral circulation from the leptomeningeal anterior cerebral artery and retrograde opacification of the distal M1 segment.
An angiogram was obtained by pulling back the microcatheter to show the extent of the thrombus.
According to exclusion criteria of the SITS-MOST Study Protocol [], Rendu Osler syndrome represents an absolute contraindication for rt PA infusion.

Recanalization was achieved with rapid inflations (duration of the inflation, maximum 10 s) at different levels of the M1 trunk.
At the end of the procedure, the artery was recanalized. Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Perfusion Categories (TICI) was grade 3 (Figure ).
Follow-up CTP after 24 h and 7 days revealed persistence of the mismatch (Figure ).

The patient is 70 years old. Because the age is between 65 and 74, one point added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 6. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 6.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 6."

He presented with a 1 week history of sudden onset of severe lower back and loin pain accompanied by swelling of both lower limbs and reduced urine output. He had no past medical or family history, and was an ex-smoker. Apart from his work as a taxi driver, there was no history of immobility, long airline journeys or major physical exertion. He took no regular medication. His blood pressure was 149/70 mmHg, pulse 100/min. Abdomen was distended without a palpable mass. Bladder was empty after catheterization and he remained anuric. Biochemically, he had severe renal failure (creatinine 1167 μmol/L = 13.2 mg/dL). His white cell count was 12 800 × 106/mL, C-reactive protein 283 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 55 mm and serum albumin 41 g/L. His clotting profile was normal, d-dimer was 15 570 ng/mL (normal below 250) and creatinine kinase was 51 IU/mL.
A central venous dialysis catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein. The operator reported difficulty in cannulating the vein but on haemodialysis high venous pressure and poor blood flow were noted. This catheter was removed and further haemodialysis was carried out via a right internal jugular venous catheter.
The next day, computed tomography (CT scan-venous phase contrast) of thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed complete venous thrombotic occlusion extending from both common femoral veins to the supra-renal inferior vena cava (IVC), and both the renal veins were occluded with oedematous kidneys (). No malignancy was seen.
The interventional radiologists started thrombolytic therapy: initially, venous access was gained in the left femoral vein and digital subtraction venography demonstrated near-occlusive thrombus extending from the femoral vein to the supra-renal IVC as seen on CT. At this point, a 20 cm Cragg-McNamara thrombolysis catheter (EV3) was placed along the length of the IVC and a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) was administered as a bolus of 5 mg, followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h for 12 h. A simultaneous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a rate of 500 IU/h was given through the femoral vascular access sheath for 48 h. Repeat venography at 12 and 48 h showed some minor improvements but still significant residual thrombus. Then, renal venography and thrombolysis were attempted via a right internal jugular vein approach after placement of a vascular access sheath. Imaging from here identified supra-renal IVC stenosis, which was angioplastied with a 12 mm diameter balloon. Venography showed heavy thrombus burden within the left renal vein and thrombus at the origin of the right renal vein. A new Cragg-McNamara (EV3) thrombolysis catheter was positioned in the left renal vein thrombus and further rTPA bolus (four pulse spray of 1 mg) followed by continuous infusion (1 mg/h) was given. Right renal vein patency was gained by suction thrombectomy of the thrombus at its origin and balloon angioplasty of the same region to disperse residual thrombus. Venography 48 h later showed complete patency of both renal veins; the supra-renal IVC stenosis was apparent and a 22 mm × 80 mm Sinus XL stent was deployed across this successfully. Venography then demonstrated patency of the IVC and both renal veins.
Urine output resumed on the third day of starting thrombolysis, oedema gradually settled and the creatinine level continued to improve (). The antiphospholipid screen was negative [protein C 130 U/dL (66–122), protein S 112 U/dL (74–146), antithrombin III 134 U/dL (75–140), activated protein C ratio 2.99 [>2.1], factor V Leiden absent, lupus anticoagulant negative, anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies 2 U/mL (0–20), cardiolipin antibodies IgG <12 U/mL (0–12) and IgM <10 U/mL (0–10)]. The patient was anticoagulated with warfarin. Magnetic resonance venography () at 3 months confirmed patency of all veins and the stented IVC segment. Eight months after initial presentation, the creatinine level was still normal at 76 μmol/L.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [31, 'years'], 'creatinine': [13.2, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",4.666,4.433,4.899,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 31 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 13.2 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (13.2/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**31 * 1.0 = 4.666.

His medical history revealed a cardiac fibroma that was detected prenatally. After birth, the fibroma was partially resected twice at another hospital, as the size and extent of the tumor prohibited single-stage resection. Heart transplantation was considered at the time. At the age of 2 years, he experienced cardiac arrest and was admitted to the same hospital. At that time, ventricular tachycardia was repeatedly detected. He developed central nervous system complications, including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and quadriplegia, after which he had received oral amiodarone. Later, hydrocephalus was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and he was treated with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.
The patient’s medication was discretionally discontinued at 10 years of age. At 12 years of age, he experienced a cyanotic spell at home and was unable to breathe. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his father. When the rescue squad arrived, they determined that he was in ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation was performed, and sinus rhythm was restored. The boy was transported to a local hospital where he received endotracheal intubation. Thereafter, he was referred to our hospital, where he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.
On admission, the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate were 115/70 mm Hg and 151 beats per minute, respectively. He was intubated and was in a stuporous state. Cardiac murmurs were not heard on chest auscultation. Venous blood gas analysis revealed pH, 7.22; pCO2, 58 mm Hg; pO2, 28 mm Hg; HCO3, 18.9 mmol/L; and SvO2, 39%. Serum biochemical analysis showed a lactate level of 9.25 mmol/L. The levels of serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 109 mEq/L; total calcium, 8.4 mEq/L; ionized calcium, 2.3 mEq/L; inorganic phosphorous, 4.0 mg/dL; and magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL. Serum cardiac enzyme levels were as follows: creatine kinase, 155 IU/L; creatine kinase-MB, 3.37 ng/mL; troponin-T, 0.137 ng/mL; and pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 85.9 pg/ml. Cardiomegaly was observed on chest radiography (). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with intermittent monomorphic ventricular premature contractions (VPCs). On the 1st day of hospitalization, the patient was supported by mechanical ventilation, without an intravenous inotropic agent. On the 2nd day, VPCs preceded abrupt ventricular fibrillation. He was resuscitated with sinus rhythm restoration following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation (2 J/kg). Transthoracic echocardiography () and cardiac computed tomography () demonstrated a known fibroma (about 9.5 cm × 5.5 cm) in the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle without blood flow obstruction. Soon after, he developed ventricular tachycardia (), and direct current cardioversion was performed along with intravenous amiodarone administration. Additionally, intravenous dopamine was administered for hypotension management. From the third to 9th days of hospitalization, he experience recurrent ventricular tachycardia refractory to multiple (45 times) direct current cardioversions (2 to 4 J/kg) and aggressive administration of antiarrhythmic agents (intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine). Although we suspected that the fibroma induced the arrhythmia, we believed additional partial resection of the tumor would not prevent it. Further, the patient’s poor neurocognitive and psychomotor states posed additional considerations for management. On the 10th day of hospitalization, he underwent an electrophysiology study, and a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) generator (Visia AF MRI XT VR SureScan; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a lead (model 6935M-62cm, Medtronic) attached to the right ventricle was inserted (). On the 11th day, weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated. Additionally, the intravenous antiarrhythmic agents were discontinued, and oral amiodarone (10 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (0.75 mg/kg/day) were prescribed. On the 18th day, in the absence of an episode of ventricular arrhythmia from ICD memory for five days, he was discharged in stable condition with the ICD generator and followed up in the outpatient clinic.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [109.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [18.9, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [142.0, 'mEq/L']}",14.1,13.395,14.805,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 109.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 18.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.9 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.9 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.9 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.9 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.9 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 142.0 mEq/L - (109.0 mEq/L + 18.9 mEq/L) = 14.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.1 mEq/L."

The patient's heart rate is 75.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 4500.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 13.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min.

He and his wife denied recent trips outside the city. Zoonosis was absent. He was not physically active and did not have an adequate diet. Pathological antecedents revealed liver cirrhosis, diagnosed 12 years ago, alongside esophageal varices that had been treated with sclerotherapy 7 years prior. He also had a diagnosis of essential hypertension, diagnosed 20 years ago. His treatment prior to hospitalization included 20 mg of propranolol every 12 hours, which was used to treat his essential hypertension, esophageal varices, and to reduce his portal hypertension.
He arrived at our institution “IMSS General Hospital Zone 1, Colima” in the early afternoon (day 1, see Table ). He began to experience extreme pain localized in his right foot, 16 to 18 hours prior to admission, with a local pain scale of 10/10. He denied any recent forms of punctures to the overlying skin (including animal and insect bites).
On physical examination during admission, he was somnolent, oriented in person and space, but not oriented to time. His vital signs were: arterial pressure (AP, systolic/diastolic) 67/49, mean AP (MAP) 55, heart rate (HR) 88, respiratory rate (RR) 16, and body temperature 36 °C. He presented hepatopathy facies and spontaneous eyelid opening, his oral mucosa was dry, and his neck showed jugular engorgement grade I. Both hemithorax were slightly hypoventilated with no adventitious sounds. Precordial was rhythmic with low intensity sounds and no murmurs were heard. Peristalsis was present in his abdomen but low in intensity and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. His upper extremities were symmetrical, eutrophic, with no signs of edema; he moved his upper extremities freely without any limitation, no asterixis was present, and a force scale of 4/5 was seen. During exploration of inferior extremities, there was a clear asymmetric pattern. His right lower extremity was volume augmented with signs of edema ++ including large and small bullae formation with serohematogenous liquid inside involving most of his right foot and ankle (Fig. ). The pedal pulse was present but weak and had a local elevated temperature on palpation. His movements were markedly limited due to extreme pain. Deep vein thrombosis maneuvers were performed and were not present. Plantar reflexes were also not seen.
A peripheral intravenously administered high-dose double scheme of antibiotics (clindamycin plus ceftriaxone), crystalloid fluids, and corticosteroids was initiated. Laboratory studies were performed soon after admission: hemoglobin (Hb) 12.6 g/dl, hematocrit (Htc) 40.3%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 103.9 fL, white blood cells (WBC) 39,400/mm3, neutrophils 37,460/mm3, platelets 104,000/mm3, thrombin time (TT) 26.7 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.15, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 42.8 seconds, glucose 61 g/dL, urea 102.72 mg/dL, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TB) 3.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin (DB) 2.6 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 1.5 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 58 U/L, P 7.1 mEq/L, Ca 8.4 mEq/L, Cl 106 mEq/L, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 129 mEq/L, Mg 1.72 mEq/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 420 U/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.07 mg/L. Correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance was initiated. Deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by clinical assessment and Doppler ultrasound. Aspiration of bulla liquid was obtained and sent to a laboratory for cultivation (positive to Cedecea lapagei, results returned on day 2). Interdisciplinary consultation with angiology was carried out (no indications were added). He was classified with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 11, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II of 22 points (42.4% mortality rate), and a Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score of 11 points (high risk > 75% of having necrotizing fasciitis) [].
In the late afternoon (day 1) his somnolence and disorientation persisted, he was hypotensive with an AP of 80/40 with a MAP of 55, and he was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. His hypoglycemia persisted despite vigorous treatment. No fever was present and his skin was pale. His left lower limb had ascending progression of serohematogenous bullae proximal to the patella. His extreme pain continued. Since our patient’s MAP was persistently below 65 mmHg despite intravenously administered fluid therapy, an anterior jugular central venous catheter was placed and we decided to include norepinephrine 8 mg in 0.9% 1000 cc physiological solution passing at a rate of 8 ml/hour, categorizing the case as septic shock []. Concomitantly he had developed acute kidney injury (AKI) “Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes” (KDIGO) stage II.
During the night (day 1), abundant large fetid serohematogenous bullae and edema continued to advance up his right thigh with persistent generalized hypoperfusion. Because of previous mentioned conditions, it was decided to change antibacterial therapy to intravenously administered imipenem and clindamycin. Bullae fluid culture results and antibiogram were not available at that time. Norepinephrine was boosted to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg. Intensive care unit (ICU) was called in for valorization to admit our patient. Unfortunately, due to the lack of space in the ICU, this idea was dismissed. Since rapid deterioration was evident, new laboratory studies were ordered (approximately 10 hours after initial blood test): Hb 10.1 g/dL, Htc 32.7%, MCV 107.5 fL, WBC 11.6/mm3, platelets 35,000/mm3, TT “Does not coagulate”, PTT “Does not coagulate”, glucose 30 g/dL, urea 115.5 mg/dL, creatinine 2.4 mg/dL, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 130 mEq/L, LDH 406 U/L, and CRP 220 mg/L. His SOFA score was 16.
Necrotizing fasciitis was our primary diagnosis due to clinical and laboratory findings (LRINEC score of 12 points). Even though the diagnosis was very likely, the lack of a biopsy study meant that we could not confirm such a diagnosis. Multiple organ dysfunction secondary to septic shock was also diagnosed. The differential diagnosis of animal or insect bite was dismissed due to lack of exposure history and lack of puncture wound.
During the next morning (day 2) he maintained the same general conditions. Norepinephrine was boosted up again (MAP 50). Soon after, he entered cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Unfortunately he died later that morning.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [102.72, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [61.0, 'g/dL'], 'Sodium': [129.0, 'mEq/L']}",3683.575,3499.396,3867.754,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 129.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mEq. To convert from 129.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 129.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 129.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 129.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 129.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 102.72 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 61.0 g/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from g to mg. The mass of glucose is 61.0 g. To convert 61.0 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 61.0 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 61000.0 mg glucose. The volume units is dL so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 61.0 g glucose/dL converts to 61000.0 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 129.0 + (102.72 / 2.8) + (102.72 / 18) = 3683.575 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 3683.575 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 3683.575 mOsm/kg."

On examination, he was noted to have a temperature of 100.7 °F (38.17 °C), blood pressure of 93/56 mm Hg, a pulse of 147 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. He had labored breathing, suprapubic tenderness, and frank pus in his urine when a urinary catheter was placed. He was emergently intubated and mechanically ventilated because his cardiorespiratory status deteriorated. At the time of admission, our patient’s white blood cell (WBC) count was 16,500/μL (neutrophils 75 %, lymphocyte 12.5 %, and bands 8.4 %). His biochemical parameters were within physiological limits except for his serum creatinine at 2.4 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 52 mg/dL. Two sets of blood culture and a urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae (a final report including the culture antibiotic sensitivity was reported on day 4 of his hospitalization). A renally adjusted dose of imipenem-cilastatin was initiated because of his prior history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella UTIs. Sedatives were discontinued, and our patient was successfully extubated after he demonstrated clinical improvement. Our patient was oriented to place, person, time, and situation after extubation; an assessment using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) did not demonstrate any delirium. His family noted that he looked better and was conversing normally. The dose of imipenem-cilastatin was readjusted (increased) on his third day of hospitalization owing to the recovery of his renal function. On the fourth day of hospitalization, he was restless and agitated by paranoid thoughts (Fig. ). He reported seeing and hearing people from his church planning to burn him at the stake.
The differential diagnoses entertained at this time were ICU delirium, encephalitis, endocrine dysfunction, structural neurological lesions (possibly stroke), or toxic ingestion. Our patient was oriented to place, person, and time with no new neurological deficits except for the visual and auditory hallucinations. Despite having an acute change in his baseline mental status (Richmond Agitation Sedation Score [RASS] 0 to 1+), he did not demonstrate any inattention (as demonstrated by picking ‘2’s) and, therefore, CAM-ICU was not diagnostic for ICU delirium. When our patient’s laboratory tests were repeated at the time of the psychotic symptoms, his WBC count was 9400/μL (neutrophils 74.2 %, lymphocyte 14.2 %). His biochemistry panel revealed serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (eGFR, 65 mL/min/1.73 m2), BUN of 15 mg/dL, serum sodium of 138 mEq/L, serum potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, serum chloride of 102 mEq/L, and serum bicarbonate of 22 mEq/L. His 8 a.m. cortisol level was 18 μg/dL and his thyroid function was within physiological limits (TSH 1.04 mIU/L, free T4 7.4 μg/dL, and free T3 83 ng/dL). Repeat urine and blood cultures performed while he was experiencing psychotic symptoms were later reported to have tested negative for any infection. Further neurological imaging or invasive neurological procedures were not performed because he did not have any new focal neurological deficits.
Brief psychotic episode was diagnosed as per the fifth edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, and delirium was excluded because inattention could not be demonstrated. All reversible causes of psychosis were sought. The only change in the management of our patient was a change in the dose of imipenem-cilastatin; this was considered to be a possible etiology for psychosis. Objective evidence of a causal relationship between the drug and psychosis was assessed using the Naranjo Probability Scale. Our patient’s Naranjo adverse drug reaction (ADR) probability scale score was calculated to be +7; imipenem-cilastatin was the probable culprit []. Imipenem-cilastatin was discontinued, and he was switched to ceftriaxone according to susceptibilities from the blood and urine culture. His mood and behavior improved; all visual and auditory hallucinations resolved by his sixth day of hospitalization. He experienced similar psychiatric symptoms 2 months later when imipenem-cilastatin was initiated empirically for complicated UTI. On this readmission, the Naranjo ADR probability scale score was +9, definite, when he was rechallenged with imipenem-cilastatin. His hallucinations resolved within 48 hours of discontinuing imipenem-cilastatin, as in the first instance. Unfortunately, on both occasions, the levels of imipenem or cilastatin were not estimated owing to laboratory and logistic issues.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [102.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [22.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Sodium': [138.0, 'mEq/L']}",14.0,13.3,14.7,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L."
3785,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-5813332-1,Extracted,"A 34-year-old woman (height = 160 cm; weight = 50 kg) was scheduled for emergency surgery due to an open fracture of her left tibia and closed fracture of her right femur, which were sustained during a traffic accident. She had no past medical history. There were no other organ injuries, including those of the neck, face, thorax, or abdomen. The results from an ECG and chest radiograph revealed no acute or pathologic lesions.
After obtaining informed consent for surgery and anesthesia, the patient entered the operating room and routine monitoring, including capnography, a 3-lead ECG, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, mechanosensor-neuromuscular transmission (M-NMT) module, and Entropy module on Datex-Ohmeda, was performed. Her initial blood pressure (BP) was 120/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats/min, and her pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99%. After preoxygenation with 100% O2 at 8 L/min delivered through a mask for a few minutes, a remifentanil infusion (0.02 mcg/kg/min) was started and 80 mg of propofol was administered intravenously. After LOC, supramaximal stimulation using NMT was checked; thereafter, 35 mg of rocuronium was injected. Tracheal intubation using a cuffed 7.0-mm endotracheal tube was performed without difficulty. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5 L/min of O2, 1.5 L/min of medical air, 1.0 to 2.0 vol% of sevoflurane, and a 0.02 - 0.10 mcg/kg/min remifentanil infusion. Thirty minutes after intubation, surgical drapes and other preparations were completed and an incision was performed. Her vital signs and other monitored parameters were within a 20% range of the preoperative levels.
However, 45 min after intubation, the response entropy (RE) abruptly increased up to 100 and the state entropy (SE) to 91. NMT was exhibited in 4 of the counts with a 46% train of four (TOF) ratio, even though capnography showed no sign of spontaneous breathing. There were no significant changes in her vital signs. Even though 3 vol% of sevoflurane was temporarily administered, the entropy did not change. Because there was no other evidence of ROC, we applied additional EEG monitoring and used the Root with SedLine monitor (Fig. ) and confirmed a PSI of 50% and EMG of 23% (Fig. ). We assumed that the elevated EMG activity might cause an unusual elevation in the readings from the Entropy monitor. Thereafter, 10 mg of rocuronium was injected. After a few tens of seconds, TOF of NMT and RE/SE values on the Entropy monitor decreased gradually and simultaneously. When the NMT count reached 2 (2 mins after rocuronium injection), 59% of RE, 58% of SE, 40% of PSI, and 0% of EMG were assessed. Coincidently, the surgeon started to hammer on the nail in the patient’s tibia. He hammered regularly using the continuously repeated “hit - hit - pause” method. The “pause” step occurred at approximately 1.8 Hz of frequency. Within a minute, 3 TOF counts of NMT, 94% of RE, 79% of SE, 47% of PSI, and 0% of EMG were assessed (Fig. ). However, after a few minutes, the value of entropy decreased by less than 60. Twenty minutes later, the TOF count reached 4 and RE/SE values on the Entropy monitor increased to above 90 again while the PSI values were maintained below 50. Therefore, we discontinued monitoring with Entropy.
No other specific events occurred during the remaining intraoperative period. The patient did not complain of recall in the postoperative period. Upon discharge from the PACU, the last memories the patient had prior to sleep were the events of the surgical time-out just after entering the operating room. The first memory the patient had after awakening was the instruction from the medical staff to open her eyes in the recovery room. The patient did not dream during surgery. Mild surgical pain and dry mouth were the only discomforts the patient complained of in the recovery room.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [160.0, 'cm']}",52.382,49.763,55.001,"The patient's gender is Female.

5472,26,Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-2621138-1,Extracted,"A 15 year old girl was brought to the emergency department with a history of sudden onset of paresthesia, involving initially the right leg, then, the right arm, the face and, subsequently the entire right side of the body, increasing during activity (walking) and ceasing during sleep, of two days duration. The patient described this as „the feeling of pins and needles“. There was no previous history of fever, headache, and neurological illnesses. She did not receive any medication. She was non-smoker. Clinical examination revealed a normal developed young girl, with normal memory, speech and orientation, with normal physical exam.
The preliminary impression of the emergency staff was of a functional disorder, and the patient was discharged home, with the recommendation to take calcium and magnesium supplements, being well known that the paresthesia of the mouth, hands, and feet is a common, transient symptom of the related conditions of hyperventilation syndrome and panic attacks. The patient was called back for a formal neurologic assessment scheduled for the next day. On the same day, the patient came back, with repeated involuntary movements involving her right side (foot, arm and face). She was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit and a diagnosis of Hemichorea-Hemiballismus (HC-HB) was made.
Hypotonia of muscles with normal power and normal deep tendon reflexes were present symmetrically. Her blood pressure was 110/55 mm Hg. Keyser Fleischer ring was absent at slit lamp examination.
This clinical symptom of spontaneous hemichorea was considered secondary to a poststreptococcal neurological disease, Sydenham's chorea, but was not associated with other clinical features of rheumatic fever (carditis, arthritis, erythema, rheumatic nodules) and neuropsychological features (dysarthria and emotional disorders). Also, the choreiform movements are rather more continuous in chorea Sydenham than paroxysmal as observed in the described case and the serum anti-streptolysin-O titre was < 200 IU.
Also, the possibility of continuous focal seizures (epilepsia partialis continua [EPC]) causing unilateral movements and CNS involvement (the contralateral basal ganglion, the thalamus and the subcortical areas) was considered. As a result, electroencephalography and brain CT and MRI scanning were scheduled.
Ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes are the cause of chorea in most elderly patients, and these etiologies were excluded in our patient, based on the neuroimaging studies. Other differential diagnosis considered were: encephalitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, basal ganglia calcifications, Wilson's disease, thyroid disease and tuberous sclerosis. CSF was normal, anti-nuclear antibodies were negative, and serum ceruloplasmin and thyroxine levels were within the normal range. Also, the CT of the head did not reveal any lesion in the basal ganglia, as well as brain MRI exam. EEG was normal, even during the ictal recording, excluding the possibility of epilepsy [Fig. , Fig. ].
Multiple medications in different combinations were tried, including haloperidol, phenobarbital, clonazepam, diazepam, with minimal immediate benefit. Severe pain from the continuous right arm jerking was treated with perfalgan.
Other laboratory tests revealed: haemoglobin of 13 g%, total count of 8,800/mm3, differential count of N 60 E1 L29, and normal liver function tests. Her urea and serum creatinine were 20 mg% and 0.8 mg% respectively. Urine exam: glycosuria, without ketones. Blood glucose concentration was 367 mg% and glycosylated haemoglobin A1C was 13.9%. Estimated blood osmolality was 294 mosm/L and ketones were absent. Serum sodium: 132 mEq/L; potassium: 4.2 mEq/L; serum calcium and magnesium levels were normal. The diagnosis of diabetes was made and the patient was started on rapid analog insulin subcutaneous, until her blood sugar was brought below 250 mg%, following which long-acting insulin was started and continued for the first day. At the end of 24 hours, her blood sugar was 148 mg% and the involuntary movements had completely disappeared. She remained asymptomatic during her hospital stay and was discharged home on a combination of rapid-acting analog, before meals and long-acting analog insulin (subcutaneous) before dinner.
GAD antibodies were positive and C-peptide was low. Based on the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (9,000 U/ml; normal < 1. 4 U/ml), low C-peptide and high insulin requirements, we diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [367.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [132.0, 'mEq/L']}",138.408,131.488,145.328,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.

He also had an implanted defibrillator (cardio-resynchronized therapy with defibrillator) to treat chronic heart failure resulting from a myocardial infarction. He had a poor appetite and general malaise without abdominal pain or fever. These symptoms gradually worsened, and he was hospitalized. At the time of admission, his blood pressure was 94/52 mmHg, his height was 165 cm, and his weight was 53 kg. At auscultation, no gallop rhythm was heard, and his extremities were not edematous. The laboratory parameters at the time of admission were as follows: white blood cells, 8080/μL; hemoglobin, 13.5 g/dL; platelets, 121 × 103/μL; total protein, 5.2 g/dL; albumin, 1.8 g/dL; lactate dehydrogenase, 309 U/L; glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, 25 U/L; glutamate pyruvate transaminase, 19 U/L; blood urea nitrogen, 28 mg/dL; creatinine, 4.97 mg/dL; sodium, 125 mmol/L; potassium, 2.7 mmol/L; chlorine, 91 mmol/L; calcium, 6.8 mg/dL; phosphorus, 4.1 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 0.092 mg/dL; procalcitonin, 0.21 ng/mL; BNP, 319 pg/mL; intact parathyroid hormone, 149 pg/mL; and β2-microglobulin, 23.4 μg/mL. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral free air in the abdomen (). Subsequent computed tomography of the abdomen revealed marked PP (Figures and ).
Peritonitis due to perforation of the digestive tract was suspected, but the possibility of perforation was considered very low because of the absence of abdominal pain, fever, and turbidity of dialysis drainage. Insufficient priming (air removal) at the time of peritoneal dialysis bag replacement was suspected, and the patient was instructed on how to perform sufficient priming. As a result, the free air in his abdominal cavity gradually disappeared ().","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [75, 'years'], 'weight': [53.0, 'kg'], 'height': [165.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [4.97, 'mg/dL']}",9.627,9.146,10.108,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 75 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 4.97 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 165.0 cm, which is 165.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.65 m. The patient's weight is 53.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 53.0 kg / (1.65 m * 1.65 m) = 19.467 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 19.5, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 53.0 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 75) * 53.0 * 1) / (4.97 * 72) = 9.627 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 9.627 mL/min."

Past medical history includes hypertension, diverticulosis and osteoarthritis. Symptoms came on spontaneously, with no aggravating or alleviating factors. She vomited twice prior to presentation, with nonbloody and nonbilious vomitus. She described her abdominal pain as generalized, dull and aching in nature, and constant over these three days. She experienced one week of constipation, and denied any diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. Additionally, she endorsed generalized weakness, body aches (most notably in her legs), and intermittent headache that had been persisting for about four weeks.
On presentation, her physical exam consisted of a blood pressure of 173/78 mmHg but otherwise normal vital signs, normal neurologic examination, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Initial laboratory workup revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 12,300/ul of blood with 51% lymphocytes on differential, low sodium at 127 milliequivalents per liter, potassium at 3.5 milliequivalents per liter, chloride at 95 milliequivalents per liter, creatinine at 0.42 milligram/deciliter, AST at 88 U/L, ALT 99 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 119 U/L, total bilirubin at 0.8 mg/dL, calcium at 7.8 mg/dL, and albumin at 3.2 g/dL.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed no acute abnormalities (Figure )
CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an enlarged spleen measuring 17.8 cm as well as diverticulitis of the descending and sigmoid colon with colonic wall thickening and surrounding inflammation (Figure ).
Intravenous metronidazole and levofloxacin were started for suspected diverticulitis. The day after admission, she developed left arm weakness and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was ordered. The findings of the MRI were nonspecific, described as mild T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter with non-specific changes (Figure ).
After two days, the patient began to experience lower extremity weakness and was unable to walk without assistance. The following day, she had right facial droop and was alert with dysarthria and incomplete right lid closure. On exam, she had diffuse motor weakness of bilateral upper and lower extremities, intact sensation, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Neurology was consulted and lumbar tap was ordered. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless and analysis revealed albumin 100 mg/dL, albumin (MS) 2950 mg/dL, IgG 22 mg/dL, no oligoclonal bands, white blood cells 1/mm3, and red blood cells 1/mm3, with an opening pressure of 6 cm H2O.
Additionally during hospital stay, the cause of the patient’s splenomegaly and lymphocytic leukocytosis were evaluated by examining peripheral blood. Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis of the same showed 48% small kappa clonal B-cell population expressing Cluster of differentiation (CD) 19 and moderate CD20; the sample was negative for CD5, CD10, CD25 and CD103. About 27.5% neutrophils with <0.1 % myeloblasts were identified. These findings are consistent with B-cell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. The patient received intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for five days as well as supportive care with physical and occupational therapy for treatment of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Her strength improved and she was ultimately discharged to inpatient rehab with subsequent oncology follow up.
After discharge, she experienced B symptoms including fatigue, fever, and sweats.

Initial vital signs were blood pressure 195/86, heart rate 104, respiratory rate 19, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, and temperature 37.1°C. Laboratory values were significant for acute kidney injury (AKI) with new elevated creatinine (2.2), troponin-T elevation (0.57), creatine kinase (CK) total (3,124), and CK-muscle/brain (CKMB; 11.1). The patient was promptly started on insulin for hyperglycemia. An electrocardiogram was performed, showing regular rhythm with Q waves and ST elevation in V1 and V2 (Figure ) without significant ST depressions, which was similar to an old electrocardiogram (Figure ). As noted earlier, the patient had elevated troponins so interventional cardiology was promptly consulted through our transfer center. The interventional cardiology team reviewed all the electrocardiograms, and recommendations included non-emergent catheterization, to repeat the electrocardiogram in two hours, and to administer aspirin, intravenous (IV) heparin, IV nitroglycerin, and pain control.
The patient was observed in the emergency department for serial exams. Subsequently, the noninterventional cardiologist was consulted and he agreed with interventional cardiology’s assessment and plan for the case. A repeat two-hour electrocardiogram was similar to the initial electrocardiogram (Figure ). During his course in the emergency department, the patient’s chest pain was resolving, but he started complaining of gradual onset abdominal and back pain that was refractory to all pain medications. He then started complaining of bilateral lower extremity paresis and anesthesia. On reevaluation, he had no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse and no detectable pulse by Doppler or ultrasound. The compartments were soft and the distal extremities warm.
CT scans were performed, which showed a filling defect in the distal infrarenal aorta that was confirmed to be a distal infrarenal aortic saddle thrombus extending into the bilateral common iliac arteries (Figure ). Additionally, an intraventricular thrombus was identified that was thought to be the cause of the aortic thrombus (Figure ). Neurology was consulted at the time of intracardiac thrombus diagnosis and agreed to not give thrombolytics because the patient stated that he had a prior history of nonsurgical hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). However, they did agree with anticoagulation and to obtain an MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) brain/neck at admission to assess the showering of thrombi to the brain. The patient was transferred emergently to the operating room for vascular surgery to perform emergent thrombectomies and bilateral lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomies.
The patient had multiple tests during his hospital course, showing that the damage caused by the 1.7 cm cardiac intramural thrombus involvement had been diffuse. His MRI brain showed multiple subacute infarcts, indicating that the intramural cardiac thrombus had been present for weeks before he came to the emergency department. He also had right inferior pole renal infarcts that were age-indeterminate. On repeat testing, the size of the cardiac thrombus was shown to decrease after anticoagulation during hospital admission.
The patient’s hospital course included anticoagulation and hemodialysis due to rhabdomyolysis, causing acute tubular necrosis. He also had eventual stent placement during admission for subcritical CAD. The patient was in the intensive care unit for three weeks for frequent postoperative neurologic checks, respiratory support, and dialysis support; he was then discharged to inpatient rehabilitation six weeks after that. He now requires a wheelchair for mobility due to paraplegia and a urinary catheter for incontinence but does not require dialysis.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Male', 'creatinine': [2.2, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [59, 'years']}",33.66,31.977,35.343,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

Her oxygen saturation was 98% without oxygen supplementation. Pulmonary auscultation revealed no abnormalities. Clubbed-finger was present but not as notably as in her younger sister.
We used lung tissue obtained from her previous biopsy to perform a PAS stain which had a positive result. Her chest HRCT showed patches and nodular opacities on the apicoposterior of the left lung lobe, multiple cystic lucency in subpleural of both upper lobes (Fig. B) . Like her sister, the patient had a mutation in the SLC7A7 gene including C.1387 del C and IVS4+1C>T. Her Lung function tests showed FVC at 69% of predicted, FEV1 at 73% of predicted, FEV1/FVC at 110%, DLCO at 56% of predicted. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlargement of the liver and spleen. Blood ammonia was 60 umol/L (11-40). Serum ferritin was 568.98 ng/mL (10-120). Metabolic disease screening by blood testing showed Citrulline was 33.25 umol/L (2.7-38), Arginine was 1.87 umol/L (0-50), Citrulline/Arginine was 17.71 (<7). Increased lysine was shown through urine tests. The patient was also diagnosed LPI with PAP. We recommended she restrict protein intake then supplement with vitamins and calcium. She chosen not to inhale rGM-CSF due to economic reasons. Eighteen months later, her lung function test result showed FVC at 68.2% of predicted, FEV1 at 74.9% of predicted, FEV1/FVC at 111.1%, DLCO at 64.5% of predicted. Her chest HRCT showed no improvement compared to her condition at admission (Fig. C). Blood ammonia was 40 umol/L (11-40).",What is the patient's body surface area?

625,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-3816164-1,Extracted,"A 63-year-old Korean woman with a past medical history of hypertension and a 25-year history of SLE presented with a 3-week history of shortness of breath. She had been treated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day and varying doses of prednisone between 5 and 15 mg/day for the SLE. Additionally, the hypertension was under control with carvedilol 25 mg/day. On examination, her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 112 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.5℃. Jugular venous distention was noted on inspection. On cardiac auscultation, her rhythm was noted to be tachycardic but regular, weak summation gallops were heard at the cardiac apex, and no pericardial friction rubs were appreciated. Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 4000/mm3 (normal, 4300-9400/mm3), hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL (normal, 12-14.3 g/dL) and platelet count of 67000/mm3 (normal, 169-365/mm3). The C-reactive protein level was found to be 0.29 mg/L (normal, 0-0.75 mg/L). A blood chemistry panel revealed a blood urea nitrogen level of 25.0 mg/dL (normal, 7-20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (normal, 0.5-1.5 mg/dL), total protein of 6.7 g/dL (normal, 6.0-8.3 gm/dL), and albumin of 3.2 g/dL (normal, 3.5-4.5 mg/dL). Analysis of the urinary sediment revealed 1-4 white blood cells/high power field (hpf), many red blood cells/hpf, and trace levels of proteinuria. Cardiac enzymelabs were drawn and found to be elevated: CK-MB of 8.7 U/L (normal, 0.6-6.3 U/L), troponin-I of 0.35 ng/mL (normal, 0.0-0.2 ng/mL), and pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 8110 pg/mL (normal, 0-125 pg/mL). Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and an electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation in leads V1-6 (). Immunofluorescence tests were negative for double-stranded DNA antibodies and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (anti-Ro and anti-La). Complement levels were found to be low (C3 0.39 g/L, normal 0.8-1.7 g/L; C4 0.04 g/L, normal 0.12-0.36 g/L). Viral markers for cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie virus B type 2, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus were all negative. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 42%] with apical akinesia but no evidence of pericardial effusion (). Echocardiography performed 2 years earlier showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a LVEF of 70%. A coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries.
We suspected takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However there was no trigger event as physical and emotional stress. The patient was treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, furosemide, and intravenous nitrates. The dose of glucocorticoids was between 0.5 to 1 mg/kg for the control of SLE activity. Her dyspnea gradually improved, however, a three-week follow-up echocardiography test revealed persistent apical ballooning and a newly developed apical thrombus (size, 1.10 × 2.12 cm) () with no significant improvement in LVEF. Heparin was then administered followed by oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. There were no embolic events during the patient's hospital stay. On the 35th day of hospital admission, follow-up echocardiography showed slightly improved wall motion of the left ventricular apex with a partially resolved thrombus and a LVEF of 50%. Although cardiac enzymes remained elevated (CK-MB 12.80 U/L and troponin-I 0.64 ng/mL), the patient was discharged on oral anticoagulation therapy.
Three months later, she was readmitted to the hospital due to a severe herpes zoster outbreak on her left shoulder. Cardiac enzymes were again found to be elevated (CK-MB 8.8 U/L and troponin-I 0.98 ng/mL). Electrocardiography revealed persistent ST segment elevation () and echocardiography revealed mild apical hypokinesia with a LVEF 50%, but no apical thrombus (). During her hospital stay she developed a mild fever and candidemia which was treated with an intravenous antifungal agent. Unfortunately, she developed septic shock and expired on day 54 of hospital re-admission.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'creatinine': [1.3, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [63, 'years']}",46.205,43.895,48.515,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 63 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.

6370,39,Anion Gap,lab test,decimal,pmc-3208579-1,Extracted,"A 63-year-old G2P2 female presented ambulatory to the ED with the chief complaint of abdominal pain, described further to the triage nurse as abdominal cramping and a mass in her vagina. The patient described that she had had a ""bulge"" in her vagina for the past 2 years and was currently being treated by her gynecologist for an enterocele with estrogen cream. Elective surgical repair of an enterocele was planned. She complained to the triage nurse of abdominal pain intermittently for the preceding 1 week. She stated that when she coughed something protruded from her vagina and she believed that her rectum had prolapsed. She was initially triaged to the lower acuity area of the emergency department, but due to worsening pain, she was brought back to a room on the acute care side approximately 30 min after her arrival. She described working in her garden when she coughed, experiencing a ""bulge"" extending through and out of her vagina. According to the patient, this ""bulge"" had been worsening for 2 months but had never extended past her labia. The patient complained of severe cramping in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen, but denied any diffuse abdominal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and breast cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy without radiation. The patient did not have a history of vaginal or vulvar cancer. Her surgical history was significant for mastectomy and breast reconstruction, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral oopherectomy (5 years previously), and pubovaginal sling (4 years previously).
On examination she was pleasant, appearing well and in no acute distress, with a temperature of 36.8 C°, pulse of 70, and blood pressure of 142/97 mmHg. Initial abdominal examination demonstrated no tenderness to palpation and no peritoneal signs. On genitourinary exam approximately 15 cm of small bowel protruded through the vaginal introitus (see Figure ). The bowel exhibited peristaltic waves and was dark red in color. Manual reduction was attempted to reduce strangulation, but was unsuccessful because of the large amount of bowel present and to the patient's discomfort during the attempt. Intravenous morphine was administered for pain control. Sterile moist gauze was placed over the eviscerated bowel, and the gynecology department was immediately consulted for surgical management of the patient. The patient was given a bolus of 1 l normal saline and intravenous ertapenam and metronidazole to cover enteric organisms.
Laboratory data results included white blood cell count, 5.9 k/ul; hemoglobin, 13.1 g/dl; hematocrit, 38.6%; platelets, 287 k/ul; prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal. Sodium was 142 mEq/l; chloride, 109 mEq/l; potassium, 3.8 mEq/l; bicarbonate 23 mEq/l; glucose, 123 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 17 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dl; calcium 9.3 mg/dl. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, with left atrial enlargement.
While awaiting surgical consultation and 45 min after being placed in a room, the patient developed relative hypotension; her blood pressure decreased from 183/108 to 107/63 mmHg. She became less responsive and experienced rigors. Repeat abdominal exam showed diffuse abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs that rapidly progressed to frank peritonitis. The herniated bowel had become dark and dusky. A second large bore IV was placed, and aggressive fluid resuscitation with 2 l normal saline was initiated. Her bed was placed in the Trendelenburg position to reduce tension on the eviscerated bowel, and preparations were made to intubate the patient because of her rapid decline. The fluid resuscitation was successful in improving her mental status and blood pressure, and she did not require intubation. She was transported quickly to the operating room for repair by both gynecology and general surgery physicians. General surgery resected approximately 20 cm of the distal ileum, which they noted to be inflamed and thickened with two areas of ischemia. This was followed by resection and repair of the vaginal cuff by gynecologic surgery. The patient was discharged from the hospital 6 days later in improved condition.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Sodium': [142.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Chloride': [109.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [23.0, 'mEq/L']}",10.0,9.5,10.5,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).

Urine analysis showed large red-blood cells and proteinuria. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.22 (7.35-7.45), a pCO2 level of 25 mmHg (normal: 35-45 mmHg), and a paO2 level of 79 mmHg (normal: 75-100 mmHg), while patient receiving oxygen therapy through high-flow nasal canula at 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). Lactic acid levels, lipid profile, total bilirubin, and coagulation studies were within normal limits, and urine toxicology screen was negative for recreational substances. Initial chest radiography (CXR) showed left lung opacity with consolidation (Figures , ). A critical care medicine evaluation was requested, and the patient was admitted to ICU with the diagnosis of severe sepsis with septic shock likely resulting from CAP. Aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation and vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin) were initiated on arrival to ICU, and the patient was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation because of worsening tachypnea and increased FIO2 requirements. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g daily) and azithromycin (500 mg daily) was initiated, along with steroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenously every six hours) and intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) infusion.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with a normal right ventricular systolic function. Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed a normal gallbladder with a normal common bile duct. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with oral contrast revealed mild peripancreatic fat stranding suggestive of non-complicated pancreatitis and duodenitis and confirmed the presence of a left lung base consolidation.
Blood culture and respiratory culture were negative. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. Legionella as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigens, by immunochromatographic assay, were reported to be positive.
On day three of ICU admission, vasopressors were titrated off, metabolic acidosis had resolved, and the patient's creatinine,liver chemistries, and CPK levels were trending downward. The patient's FIO2 requirements were decreased to 45%, and he was extubated on day five of ICU admission. After 48 hours, he was transferred to a medical ward.

On physical examination he had a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate was 115 beats/minute, blood pressure was 133/79 mm/Hg, respiratory rate was 18/min, and oxygen saturation was 97% in room air. He was lying in the bed and was conscious but not oriented. He had more diffuse rigidity in the lower limbs, however reflexes were not elicitable due to diffuse rigidity. The rest of his systemic examination was normal. He had a hemoglobin of 158 g/L (135-175 g/L), white blood count 11.1×109/L (4-11×109/L), platelet 226×109/L (150-450 ×109/L), and creatinine kinase 3792 U/L (30-300 U/L).

The patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 115.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 11.1 count/L. To convert 11.1 count/L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0 L/m^3 which will give 11.1 white blood cell count/L * 1000.0 L/m^3 = 11100.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min.

The nodule was highly suspicious for primary lung malignancy. The patient was placed in a prone position and lung parenchyma in the posterior lateral left chest was visualized. Under CT guidance, a 19-gauge guide was advanced into the left lower lobe and two separate 20-gauge core biopsy specimens were obtained from the mass. There was no hemorrhage or immediate post procedure complication. However, towards the end of the procedure, the patient started complaining of sudden onset of chest pain and became unconscious. No palpable pulses were identified. A code blue was called and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines. The patient subsequently demonstrated ventricular fibrillation which responded to defibrillation shock and epinephrine. The patient had three cycles of chest compressions, one dose of epinephrine, and a shock of 200 J. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated for mechanical ventilation.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 120.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 90.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 2.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 120.0 mEq/L - (90.0 mEq/L + 2.0 mEq/L) = 28.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 28.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 28.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 28.0 - 12 = 16.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 16.0 mEq/L."

Her score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 11 points. She was dyspneic and cyanotic. Oxygen saturation was 65%, respiratory rate was 24/min, and pulse rate was 120/min. She had hypotension (80/60 mmHg) and subfebrile fever (37.4℃). Her mucous membranes were dry. She had dry skin, sparse hair, and goiter. Cardiovascular examination revealed deep heart sounds. A chest X-ray showed a ""tents heart"" (). On echocardiography, a massive PE was found. She was taken to undergo urgent pericardiocentesis, removing 1,000 mL of fluid. Blood investigations, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serologic markers of viral pathogens and autoimmune diseases, were within normal limits. All work up of the fluid for the etiology of the PE was normal. Although pericardiocentesis was performed, hypotension did not recover. Thyroid function analysis showed raised TSH (>100 µU/mL; normal range, 0.35–5 µU/mL), decreased fT3 (0.9 pg/mL; normal range 2.3–5 pg/mL), and decreased fT4 (<0.25 ng/dL; normal range, 0.8–2 ng/dL) (). Antithyroglobulin antibody (87 IU/mL) and anti-TPO (860 IU/mL) were positive. Thyroid USG showed thyroiditis. After thyroid replacement therapy was started with an oral formulation, because intravenous thyroxine was unavailable in our country, hypotension and other complaints were resolved.

The patient was initially diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma of the back in May 2008 (American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) Stage 1b; T2a, N0, M0; BRAF V600 mutation not detected) and underwent wide local excision with clear margins. In April 2014, he presented with progressive shortness of breath and significant weight loss over the past 3–4 weeks. CT angiography of the chest showed mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, along with numerous pulmonary nodules throughout both lungs ranging between 6 mm and 3.5 cm. CT abdomen and MRI brain were done which ruled out any liver lesion or brain metastasis. Biopsy of the lung nodules confirmed metastatic melanoma (BRAF V600 mutation not detected), and treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab (3 mg/kg), was initiated. The patient received this treatment regimen for 3 months but then was lost to follow-up. In November 2014, he agreed to start therapy with nivolumab, an anti-PD- L1 antibody. Ten months later, he presented with progressive quadriplegia, lower extremity weakness worse than upper extremity weakness, developing over a few days. He reported that, due to the weakness, he fell and was unable to get up on his own. His home medication list included only nivolumab. Routine blood test in ED revealed potassium of 1.7 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 9 mEq/L, chloride of 116 mEq/L, sodium of 139 mEq/L (anion gap 14, delta ratio of 2), serum creatinine of 2.64 mg/dL (baseline of 0.91 mg/dL 3 weeks prior), and elevated eosinophils of 6%. Admission diagnosis included hypokalemia, hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury (AKI), and eosinophilia. Urinalysis revealed 1+ protein (urine protein/creatinine ratio of 1.42), fractional excretion of sodium of 1.9%, amorphous urine sediment, and 24-hour urine potassium of 159 mEq/L, hence indicating intrinsic kidney injury such as acute interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, or glomerulonephritis. Pertinent negatives in his blood work included normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Retroperitoneal ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no solid mass, stone, or obstruction. Urinary bladder also appeared normal. There was no history suggestive of previous kidney disease; autoimmune diseases such as sjögrens, lupus nephritis, or rheumatoid arthritis (RA); thyroid disorders; diabetes; vomiting; excessive alcohol use; dehydration; or exposure to nephrotoxic agents such as antibiotics, contrast, or analgesics. Based on these findings, progressive quadriplegia was secondary to hypokalemia which was due to type 1 RTA, most likely irAE secondary to anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. The offending drug was discontinued, and the patient was started on intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by a tapering dose lasting 4 weeks. IV replacement therapy with potassium and bicarbonate was also initiated. Renal biopsy was considered but was not done as the patient responded well to steroids with return of renal function to normal. Quadriplegia gradually improved which correlated to improvement in serum potassium levels. By day 3 of hospitalization, the quadriplegia had resolved.

Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 136.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.

A Spetzler catheter inserted at L4-5 interspace drained 100 mL of CSF, and was removed post-craniotomy. The patient did well initially, however, on POD 3, he developed a partial right third nerve palsy and lethargy. A Head CT revealed midline shift with an epidural air collection (). Re-exploration was performed to address the mass effect attributed to the epidural collection. At craniotomy, however, the dura and brain were depressed and not under pressure. Postoperatively, upright intracranial pressure (ICP) was -14 mmHg, and increased to 0 with supine positioning. Arteriography demonstrated no vasospasm; although the basilar artery was kinked (). A head CT revealed an oval shape midbrain (), consistent with brain sag. Two days after re-exploration, he was awake but confused, oriented to self, following only simple commands. His right pupil was dilated and nonreactive to light. He remained too lethargic to complain of positional headache but became more alert while supine.
Brain sag was confirmed by the constellation of persistent lethargy, third nerve palsy, radiographic findings and low ICP (0-3 mmHg). Seven days after aneurysm clipping, a L4-5 EBP was performed with 25 mL of blood. Within the hour, he became more awake and appropriate.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 45 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 76.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 76.0 µmol. To convert 76.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 76.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 7.6e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 7.6e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.009 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.009 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.009 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 76.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.9/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**45 * 1.012 = 80.343.

Patient had Vata Pitta pre dominance Prakriti with Madhyama Sara (medium strength), Madhyam Samhanana (medium built), Sama Pramana (proportionate body), Madhyama Satmya (medium homologation), Madhayam Satva (medium mental strength), Madhyam Vyayamshakti (medium capability to carry on physical activities), Madhyama Ahara Shakti (medium food intake capacity) and Uttama Jaranashakti (optimum digestive power).
On neurological examination, higher mental function-attention, memory, calculation abstract thought, spatial perception, visual and body perception, and speech were normal. On cranial nerve examination, Grade I nystagmus to left gaze was found. Visual acuity was normal. Slit-lamp examination of the eye and audiometric results were normal. On motor examination, bulk, tone, power and coordination of upper limbs and lower limbs were normal. Joint position sense and vibration sensation was normal.
On cardiovascular examination, pulse in both upper arms was absent. In the neck region, right carotid pulse was forceful and left carotid pulse was not palpable. Pulse in lower extremities was normal. No bruits on the carotid and renal artery were found. Blood pressure could not be measured from the upper limbs. BP was 120/76 mmHg measured from the lower limbs. Auscultation of the chest showed no heart murmur or crackles. Pulse of the right brachial and radial arteries was palpable but feeble. Pulse of the left brachial and radial arteries was not palpable. Pulse rate and respiratory rate was 60/min and 18/min, respectively. Skin, cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary system examination was normal.
A detail of the case study and follow-up is given in .
Patient was a known case of TA. CTA of the brain and neck revealed-severe stenosis (approx. 90%–95%) of right subclavian artery, complete block of left subclavian artery and proximal left vertebral artery with normal CTA of brain that is a suggestive of TA []. TA was graded as Type I, on the basis of angiographic findings and in group I, on the basis of Ishikawa clinical classification. These grading denoted the better prognosis of the case.
Atherosclerosis, giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, infectious aortitis, secondary vasculitides and developmental abnormalities (coarctation of the aorta and marfan syndrome) are the differential diagnoses of TA. Atherosclerotic plaques are commonly found in patients aged 45 years and above and also not usually associated with long segment luminal stenosis. Giant cell arteritis mostly affects patients older than 50 years. Branches of the external and internal carotid arteries are most frequently affected in giant cell arteritis. Polyarteritis nodosa commonly affects 30–50 years old, predominantly males, renal arteries, gastrointestinal arteries as the primary sites diseased and multiple small aneurysms in the involved artery. Development abnormalities are not associated with stenotic lesions in large vessels. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) culture and deoxyribonucleic acid (VZV), serology triple and oligoclonal bands test were negative for the case so infectious aortitis (tuberculosis, syphilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella, treponema, cyto-megalo virus or herpes virus) is unlikely. Test for antinuclear antibody was negative and no lupus was found, so secondary vasculitides (systemic lupus erythmatosus and sarcoidosis) were ruled out. Antiaquaporin-4 (NMO-IGG) antibodies were seropositive as the patient was suffering from longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) in past. Hence, TA was the diagnosis for the patient []. Any disease can be considered as Vata Vikara (diseases by Vata Dosha) if it have the symptoms of Shosha (atrophy/weight loss), Shoola (pain), Supti (paresthesia, tingling sensation), Sankocha (concentric wall thickening/contracture), Stambhana (stenosis/stiffness), and Khanjata (limping).[] All these symptoms remain present in TA, hence, it can be considered as Vata Vikara. More specifically, TA can be correlated with Siragata-Vata, a disease of Vata Vyadhi spectrum. Manda Sharira Ruja (mild body pain) Shopha (inflammation) and Shosha (atrophy/loss of weight), Spandana (fasciculation) in the body, Supta Sira (absence of pulsation in the blood vessels/arteries), Tanavyo Sira (spasm of vessels leading to reduction of lumen/thinning of vessels/stenosis) and Mahat Sira (dilatation of vessels/aneurysm) are the manifestation of the Siragata-Vata.[] Aneurysms, segmental narrowing, and variations in the calibre of arteries and stenosis/occlusions are the manifestation of vasculitis[] and these are also the manifestation of Siragata Vata. TA is also described as pulse less disease and having stenosis of the large vessels as cardinal feature. These symptoms are described as Supta Sira and Tanavyo Sira in Siragata-Vata disease. Hence, Siragata-Vata was considered as the Ayurvedic diagnosis for this case of TA.
There is no specific treatment advised for Siragata-Vata in classical texts. Hence, general line of treatment of Vata Vikara viz. Snehana (oleation), Swedana (sudation) Niruha Basti (enema mainly with decoction), Anuvasana Basti (enema with medicated oil), and Nasya Karma (nasal therapy) was adopted for the patient.[] According to Ayurveda, Siragata-Vata is a disease of Madhyama Roga Marga (disease pathway related to vascular system and other vital organs); hence, Basti Karma was also adopted for treatment. Castor oil in the dose of 20 ml with milk was given for first three consecutive nights for Koshtha Shuddhi (evacuation of the bowel). Shastikshali Pinda Swedana was done for 16 days starting from the 1st day. From 4th day, Erandamuladi Niruha Basti[] alternated with Anuvasana Basti of Ashwagandha Taila[] was given for 16 days. After the completion of Basti procedure, Shirovirechana (nasal therapy for purification), a form of Nasya Karma with Triphaladi Taila (oil) in a dose of 06 drops (0.4 ml)/nostril was done on alternate days for 7 days []. Ayurvedic oral medicines such as Yogaraja Guggulu-1 g (500mgx2tab), Shiva Gutika-500 mg, Dashamula Kvatha-40 ml, Narsinha Churna-3 g, Brihadvatachinamani Rasa 125 mg twice a day were prescribed to the patient []. These oral medicines except Brihadvatachinamani Rasa were prescribed up to 30 January 2016. Brihadvatachinamani Rasa was prescribed initially only for 1 month. Same Panchakarma procedure was repeated after 6 months from November 17, 2015 to December16, 2015. Chyavanaprasha Avaleha in the dose of 10 g with milk was advised twice a day after meals from February 2016 to June 2018.
Patient’s condition was assessed on Indian ITAS-2010, which is validated in Indian patients for disease activity of TA.[] Features of domains – systemic, abdomen, cardiovascular system, genitourinary, renal (systolic and diastolic hypertension), and nervous system are comprises in ITAS2010 and are scored if new or worse over the past 3 months. Weightage are given for diastolic hypertension, bruits, new pulse loss, pulse inequality, stroke, carotidynia and claudication. A maximum score of 51 is possible in this scoring and score of 4 or more is considered active. Score was 17 at the time of admission and it changed to 05 after completion of Panchakarma procedures []. After 1 month of treatment, BP was measurable from both upper limbs, but pulse in the left upper limb and left carotid artery was weak. Unequal BP in both upper limbs was noted. BP in the right hand was 120/76 mmHg and in the left hand was 110/68 mmHg. MRA which was done on June 25, 2015 showed that the TA was stable and there was no new lesion []. ITAS-2010 score was 03 after 06 months. MRA done on November 2015 and CT angiograph done on January 29, 2016 and July 1, 2016 revealed no new lesion for TA in the case [Figures and ]. ITAS-2010 score was 4 on June 13, 2018. Follow-up of the patient was scheduled annually since June 2018. The patient was assessed on June 21, 2019 and her condition was stable and there was no relapse of any manifestation at that time.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [155.7, 'cm']}",48.488,46.064,50.912,"The patient's gender is Female.

2651,7,Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-7557114-1,Extracted,"A 43-year-old female presented to the emergency department with acute onset of abdominal pain for the last 12 hours. The pain was located in the epigastric region and the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, 8/10 in intensity, sharp in nature, radiating to back associated with two episodes of non-bilious and non-bloody vomiting, no aggravating or relieving factors. The patient medical history was significant for ulcerative colitis. Her past surgical history was significant for three cesarean sections. She reported that she used to drink alcoholic beverages occasionally (one to two times per month) but stopped drinking five years ago. She denied any history of smoking or any other toxic habits. Her only medication was oral sulfasalazine two grams per day past 18 months. She denied any known allergies. The patient denied using herbal or weight losing medication
Her initial vitals were a pulse rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 126/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6˚F. On physical examination, the abdomen was soft with tenderness in the epigastric region, and bowel sounds were normal. Her initial labs showed an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 62 units/L (5-40 units/L), aspartate transaminase (AST) 164 units/L (9-36 units/L), alkaline phosphatase 98 units/L (42-98 units/L), total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL (0.2-1.2 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL (0.0-0.3 mg/dL), serum lipase 419 U/L (<60 U/L), serum ethanol level <10 mg/dL (<10 mg/dL), serum triglyceride level 88 mg/dL (45-150 mg/dL), serum calcium 8.7 mg/dL (8.5-10.5 mg/dL), albumin 3.8 g/dL (3.2-4.8 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL (6-20 mg/dL), and serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (0.5-1.5 mg/dL). Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a normal size and texture of liver, normal gallbladder with no gallstones, and bile duct was 3 mm in size. A CT of the abdomen with oral contrast showed findings suggestive of AP without any pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation, no pancreatic duct, or common bile duct dilatation (Figure ).
Initially, during admission, sulfasalazine was continued as maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis with no improvement in symptoms. The patient continued to complain of abdominal pain and nausea. Later on, sulfasalazine was discontinued and the patient started feeling better. Two days after discontinuation of sulfasalazine, she was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet, and shortly after her diet was advanced to regular. Symptoms had resolved by day 5, and the patient was discharged safely.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

5264,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-5063483-1,Extracted,"A 56-year-old female patient, who weighed 66 kg, was 158 cm tall and had American Society of Anesthesiologists’ physical status I, was diagnosed with advanced right breast carcinoma. She presented 4 months prior to the surgery with a history of right breast lump; incisional biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. She was then commenced on neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two years prior to this, she had total thyroidectomy under GA for simple multinodular goiter complicated with stridor, hypoxia, and hoarseness of voice, secondary to vocal cord palsy, which was managed with tracheostomy. The tracheostomy tube was removed 8 months later, leaving the patient with a persistent hoarseness of voice and defective left vocal cord. She was worked up for surgery after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Her serum biochemistry, hematology, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest X-ray results were normal. She was instructed on the visual analog scale for pain intensity, where 0 meant no pain and 10 meant the worst pain imaginable. The anesthetic plan was explained to and discussed with the patient.
In the theater, intravenous (IV) access was established with 18 G cannula on the left hand, and 500 mL normal saline solution was set up. Using the Classic-120 Multiparameter® monitor (Health-Care Equipment and Supplies Co. Ltd, Surrey, UK), noninvasive blood pressure (BP), pulse oximetry, and continuous ECG were monitored. Her baseline pulse rate was 83 beats/min (bpm), BP was 146/86 mmHg, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 98%, breathing room air. Verbal contact was maintained throughout the block placement and surgery. With the patient sitting up on the operating table, a right-sided TPVB using Jüttner et al’s modification of Pfeiffer et al’s lamina technique was performed. The C7–T6 vertebral spinous processes were palpated and marked. Her T3 spinous process was identified using the scapular spine as a landmark, and 1.5 cm from the midline on the right side was marked as the needle entry point (). Povidone iodine (10%) solution was used for skin preparation, followed by infiltration of the injection site using 2 mL 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. An 18 G Tuohy needle (Portex; Smiths Medical, Ashford, UK) was inserted and advanced in a paramedian sagittal plane at 45° to the skin in the cranial direction until contact was made with the vertebral lamina at a depth of 4 cm. With a negative test aspiration of air, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, 6 mL 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was injected to facilitate insertion of the 20 G epidural catheter (Portex) 3.0 cm beyond the needle tip into the paravertebral space. The catheter was secured, and the patient was placed supine on the operating table. Test dose comprising 5 mL 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was administered via the catheter while monitoring the patient’s pulse rate, BP, respiration, and consciousness to exclude pneumothorax, epidural, or subarachnoid injection. Thereafter, 7 mL 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 20 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were injected over 10 minutes. The block was completed within 28 minutes (catheter was removed after the local anesthetic [LA] injection) and was deemed adequate in 16 minutes by loss-of-cold and pinprick sensation (by the surgeon) over the operative area. The patient was observed to be shivering, but she was reassured and received IV fentanyl 50 μg and midazolam 2 mg. Then a mixture of propofol 150 mg and ketamine 100 mg (ketofol) in 500 mL normal saline solution was infused at 2–4 mL/min to achieve a Ramsey sedation score of 3–4. Supplemental oxygen at 4 L/min via nasal prongs was commenced. The surgical incision was elliptical, which included the nipple–areolar complex and the underlying 14 cm ×16 cm breast mass. The incision at the sternal border elicited pain, for which 10 mL 0.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was infiltrated by the surgeon. Superior and inferior skin flaps were raised to the level of the clavicle and the lower coastal margins, respectively. The breast tissue was dissected off and the axilla was accessed through the same incision. The skin was closed over a drain. The duration of surgery was 95 minutes. A total of 245 mL ketofol was employed for conscious sedation. The blood loss was 150 mL; intraoperative fluid administered was 500 mL normal saline and 500 mL Gelofusine. The patient’s vital signs throughout surgery were as follows: pulse rate 60–82 bpm, BP 90/50–130/80 mmHg, and SaO2 100% at 4 L/min oxygen via nasal prongs.
At the end of surgery, the patient was transferred awake to the recovery room, and IV paracetamol 600 mg was administered. She was commenced on oral feeding 8 hours after surgery with good effect. On the ward in the first 24 hours, she had IV paracetamol 1 g, IV pentazocine 30 mg, and oral Celebrex 200 mg; her pain score was 2–3. In the next 24 hours, the pain score remained low; analgesics via oral route comprised Celebrex 400 mg and paracetamol 3 g in divided doses. She was discharged home on the sixth day. Both the surgeon and patient described the anesthesia and pain control as satisfactory.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [66.0, 'kg']}",106.0,100.7,111.3,"The patient's weight is 66.0 kg.

3746,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8443410-1,Extracted,"A 66-year-old man (body height, 168 cm; body weight, 88.5 kg) experienced dyspnea, a sensation of chest tightness, and back pain for a few days before he was brought to our hospital on an emergency basis. His symptoms became aggravated suddenly as he was about to get off a taxi on his way home from work. He presented with a history of close contact with a coworker with COVID-19 and was waiting for instructions from a public health center.
In the ambulance, the following conditions were documented: Glasgow Coma Scale score, E4V5M6; heart rate, 80/min and irregular; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; body temperature, 38.4ºC; oxygen saturation, 98% (O2 delivered with reservoir mask at a rate of 15 L/min). On admission, his white blood cell count was 22,300/µL; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 35 × 104/µL; creatinine level, 2.23 mg/dL; creatine kinase level, 2582 IU/L; creatine kinase myocardial band level, 164 ng/mL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 97 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level, 19 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 173 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9%; C-reactive protein level, 13.8 mg/dL; troponin T level, 9.640 ng/mL; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, 11753 pg/mL; procalcitonin level, 0.62 ng/mL; d-dimer level, 16.34 µg/mL; and soluble fibrin level, 113.1 µg/mL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation; ST-elevation in II, III, aVF, and V2–V6 leads; and ST depression in aVR leads (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesis extending from the anterior wall to the apex and the inferior wall in left ventricle, with an approximate ejection fraction of 20%. We diagnosed STEMI and decided to perform emergency coronary angiography (CAG). A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows in both lungs and tracheal intubation was performed in the emergency outpatient unit (Figure ). Continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 μg/kg/min) was started because his systolic blood pressure dropped below 80 mmHg. After heparin (5,000 U) was administered intravenously, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room.
CAG was performed by cardiologists, emergency physicians, clinical engineers, nurses, and radiological technologists who donned appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the room. CAG revealed total occlusion of the middle of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure ). After a loading dose of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 162 mg; clopidogrel, 300 mg), an intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was inserted, and a 7-Fr guiding catheter was inserted into the left coronary artery. We removed white material, which did not at a first glance appear to be a typical thrombus, with an aspiration catheter, but blood flow did not improve. The onset-to-device time and door-to-device time were 116 and 84 minutes, respectively. Subsequent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) revealed several structures, which were thought to be thrombi; therefore, we performed plain old balloon angioplasty (Figure ). After the balloon was expanded, blood flow improved slightly in the LAD but not distally. Next, we placed an everolimus-eluting stent (4.0 × 38 mm) in the middle of the LAD, but peripheral blood flow was still not observed. Repeated IVUS revealed severe stenosis caused by plaque with thrombi. An additional balloon was inflated at the distal site, and a cutting balloon was also used. Another everolimus-eluting stent (2.25 × 38 mm) was placed at the distal site, but no blood flow improvements were seen angiographically.
We moved a double-lumen catheter to the distal LAD and performed CAG from the distal LAD, which revealed retrograde blood flow up to the middle of the LAD and collateral circulation from the septal branch to the RCA. Repeated IVUS examination revealed thrombi and plaque at the distal end of the stent and no intrastent blood flow (Figure ). Then, we tried to perform PCI for the total occlusion of RCA, but it was unsuccessful. At this point, 7 hours passed since the patient entered the cardiac catheterization room, and so we finished the procedure. The levels of activated clotting time during PCI were maintained at 280–310 seconds. After PCI, pathological examination proved the aspirated white material was white thrombi. Chest computed tomography performed after PCI showed ground-glass opacities distributed unevenly in both the lungs, as well as left-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he showed pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with 1 mg of epinephrine and one cycle of CPR. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was considered, but his family decided against it. The blood pressure was maintained through the continuous administration of noradrenaline, dobutamine, and adrenaline. His nasopharyngeal swab was tested with polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19-related pneumonia was diagnosed. Remdesivir treatment was initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day on the 5th day of hospitalization and continued at 100 mg/day. Because of the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium (9 g/day) was also administered. However, the patient's oxygenation level worsened, and he died on the 7th day. It was difficult to confirm a main cause of death because we were not permitted to dissect patients due to COVID-19. We assumed that he had died from both cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction and septic shock due to covid-19 infection.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [168.0, 'cm']}",64.127,60.921,67.333,"The patient's gender is Male.

She had never been diagnosed with diabetes; 13 months before admission, her glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 6.1%. On diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia, she started receiving 60 mg of methylprednisolone, followed by 40 mg of prednisolone (PSL) and 4.0 mg of TAC, which was considered effective and well-tolerated therapy for interstitial lung disease with anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibody.[ The dosage of PSL was gradually decreased, and 5.0 mg of PSL and 4.0 mg of TAC had been continued to maintain the remission of interstitial pneumonia. She had no other specific medical history or any significant family history. Following were her vital signs on admission: blood pressure, 110/66 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; pulse rate, 97 beats/min; and SpO2, 96% on room air. Her height was 159 cm and her weight was 90 kg; her body mass index (BMI) was 35.6 kg/m2. On physical examination, lungs were clear to auscultation and no significant abnormalities were observed, except slight dehydration of the tongue and axilla. Laboratory data revealed the following: extremely high plasma glucose levels, 989 mg/dL (54.9 mmol/L); presence of urinary ketone bodies; blood pH, 6.85; and bicarbonate level, 2.4 mmol/L; these findings met the diagnostic criteria for DKA proposed by the American Diabetes Association.[ Fasting serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) was 0.62 ng/mL and urinary CPR was 13.4 μg/d, indicating deterioration of endogenous insulin secretion. No islet-related autoantibodies were detected (Table ). Other laboratory data are shown in Table . Intravenous continuous insulin infusion and rapid saline infusion were administered; 2 days after admission, insulin administration was switched to multiple daily subcutaneous injections using insulin lispro and insulin glargine 300 mL/unit. The maximum amount of subcutaneous insulin administered was up to 0.9 unit/kg/d. Sixteen days after admission, 10 mg of empagliflozin was also administered for inducing weight reduction. She was discharged with a prescription of 25 units/d of total daily insulin and 10 mg of empagliflozin; the dosage of PSL and TAC were maintained at 5.0 and 4.0 mg, respectively. TAC was discontinued 4 weeks after the onset of DKA as good control of interstitial pneumonia was noted. She did not require insulin lispro and insulin glargine 300 mL/unit to maintain stable glycemic control 4 and 8 days after cessation of TAC, respectively. Finally, although empagliflozin administration was also stopped 16 weeks after TAC cessation, her blood glucose levels were under good control; her HbA1c level was 6.2%, even though PSL administration was continued. Notably, her fasting serum CPR level rapidly recovered to 4.15 ng/mL, which is within the normal range, 8 weeks after TAC cessation and was maintained at similar levels thereafter (Fig. ).

The patient had a medical history of well-controlled hypertension and old healed pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had facial and neck purpuras and ecchymoses, whose cause could not be identified at a private dermatologic clinic. Blood test results concerning platelet count, prothrombin time and activated partial thrombosplastin time were normal.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol 100 mg and remifentanil 0.5 µg/kg/min. Rocuronium 50 mg was administrated to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 6 vol% desflurane with 50% O2 in air, remifentanil, and rocuromium. After a change from a supine to a prone position, bleeding from the lacerated facial purpuras was recognized while identifying head position on a Mayfield headrest. Swollen purpuras and eyeballs hyperemia were evident. The operation was canceled in order to evaluate the facial lesions and the patient was transported to the postanesthetic care unit when fully conscious.
Skin biopsy from the facial lesions () and serum free light chain assay were performed during the stay at the general ward, and resulted in the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis of monoclonal gammopathy with lambda type. Multiple myeloma, which usually accompanies systemic amyloidosis, was excluded after bone marrow biopsy and immunoprotein measurement of serum and urine.
The patient had complained of dyspnea since post-anesthesia day 16. Bilateral pleural effusion and interstitial pulmonary edema were identified by high resolution chest computed tomography. Pulmonary function test revealed moderate degree of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging taken 48 days after the anesthesia showed spontaneous resolution of the epidural mass. Post-anesthetic echocardiograph showed thickened myocardium, which was not confirmatory of cardiac amyloidosis. According to abdominal ultrasound, there was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Symptoms and signs suggesting the involvement of other organs, such as renal, neurologic, and hematologic abnormalities, were not observed.

714,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-6849010-1,Extracted,"A 50-year-old female was referred for open heart surgery under the diagnosis of mitral stenosis and aortic regurgitation combined with atrial fibrillation. She had a history of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty for mitral stenosis 11 years earlier. Her dyspnea worsened over the last 3 years and she was in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III at presentation. She was in good physical shape, weighing 66 kg, and had no neuromuscular abnormalities on physical examination. She had no underlying disease either. She underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement in addition to maze procedure for the atrial fibrillation without events. The ischemic time was 208 minutes and the total bypass time was 246 minutes, respectively. Immediately after surgery in the ICU, higher doses of inotropics and vasopressors were necessary to maintain her blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP around 80 mmHg with dopamine 10 mcg/kg/min, dobutamine 10 mcg/kg/min, norepinephrine 0.5 mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 4 unit/h). Her cardiac index measured by a Swan-Ganz catheter ranged from 2.2 L/min/m2 to 2.4 L/min/m2. Hypoxia was noted as well (PaO2 75 mmHg with FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 5 cmH2O). PaO2 rose to 93.7 mmHg with increasing positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 7 cmH2O. We did not apply higher PEEP because of hemodynamic instability. Vasopressin and norepinephrine were tapered off gradually. On postoperative day 1, she showed complete mental recovery. She opened eyes spontaneously, meeting gaze and obeyed command. Yet, her marginal hemodynamics and arterial blood gas profile (systolic BP 80−90 mmHg with dopamine 10 mcg/kg/min and dobutamine 10 mcg/kg/min, PaO2 around 70 mmHg with FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 4 cmH2O) required further ventilatory support. Fentanyl and vecuronium were given intermittently in a bolus of 50−100 mcg and 2−4 mg respectively until she was switched to the simultaneous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode on the second postoperative day. However, her respiratory status, which seemed to have improved slightly (PaO2 76.9 mmHg with FiO2 0.7 and PEEP 7 mmHg), gradually deteriorated again as reflected by increasing pulmonary infiltrate and worsening PaO2. Superimposed recurrent atrial fibrillation and high fever (38℃−39℃) worsened her condition. On postoperative day 4, her respiratory rate rose up to 40/min and she was put back on the controlled mandatory ventilation mode again. Continuous infusion of fentanyl and vecuronium was initiated at the rate of 100 mcg/hr and 4 mg/hr respectively and she was paralyzed over the next 6 days. The intermittent interruption of the infusion was attempted in order to access mental status and neurologic deficit. Neuromuscular monitoring was not considered. Bispectral index monitoring was not considered either because fentanyl was administered in low dosage. Daily spontaneous awakening trial and breathing trial were largely postponed until the improvement of pulmonary infiltrate and blood gas profile was evident. Meanwhile, antibiotics were changed from vancomycin to meropenem plus amikacin empirically although no microorganism was documented from blood cultures. Hydrocortisone sodium succinate (solu-cortef 150 mg a day) was administered intravenously for 3 days to overcome acute pulmonary dysfunction. Total serum bilirubin level had increased, peaking 15.4 mg/dl on postoperative day 7, only to decline gradually thereafter. Serum aminotransferase did not elevate beyond 175 IU/L. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were in the acceptable ranges.
Her pulmonary infiltrate had significantly improved on postoperative day 9 and she managed to be put on SIMV mode on postoperative day 10. Thereafter, recovery was slow yet straightforward and she was barely extubated on postoperative day 14. After the extubation, though her blood gas profile was in an acceptable range, her respiratory pattern was shallow and labored. Sonographic assessment of the chest wall and diaphragm movement was not considered as the respiratory muscle incoordination was evident by physical assessment alone. She complained that she could not move at all. Limply waggling of her finger tips and toe tips was at her best. Her mental recovery was full and her senses were intact. No lateralizing sign was seen. She had no history of neuromuscular disorder. A neurological examination demonstrated symmetrical muscle weakness in both upper and lower extremities (Medical Research Council grade II) and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Normal results were observed on the mini-mental state examination, as well as on cranial nerve and sensory tests. No Babinski sign or ankle clonus was observed. Initally, we thought that it was due to the delayed effect of longstanding muscle relaxant administration. However, weakness of the extremities lasted longer than expected and she remained in bed for the next couple of weeks. She had to be intermittently catheterized because of voiding difficulty. Brain computerized tomography revealed no remarkable findings. Postoperative echocardiography on postoperative day 25 revealed well-functioning prosthetic valves and normal ventricular function.
Neurologic consultation suggested CINM as a cause and thus recommended electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study as well as acetylcholine receptor antibody test to rule out myasthenia gravis. Bedside physical therapy by professionals was encouraged following the initial studies.
Although the blood level of acetylcholine receptor antibody, creatine phosphokinase, and aldolase were in normal range, the result of EMG and NCV showed a pattern of diffuse axonal motor dominant polyneuropathy (). On EMG, fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, that reflects active denervation or myopathy, observed on plenty muscles with reduced recruitment pattern (). These electrophysiologic findings were consistent with of CINM.
She was transferred to the rehabilitation center and her condition and motor weakness gradually improved with time. On postoperative day 52, follow up NCV study revealed that compound motor action potentials markedly improved to a normal range and EMG study was normal (). She eventually recovered and discharged on postoperative day 64, still in a state of mild weakness of her extremities, but leading a daily life without support.

5029,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-7291651-1,Extracted,"A 1-month old male infant weighing 3.6 kg was referred to our institution with symptoms of tachypnea and cyanosis. The patient’s mother refused to do the prenatal examination causing a delayed diagnosis. Echocardiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA) which are routinly peformed in our center for complex anatomical patterns before the operation revealed TGA with anterior-posterior-oriented great arteries, wide patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), type B IAA, ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PHT), Fig. .
In October 2019, the patient underwent a single-stage primary surgical repair. The proximal descending aorta was separated from the distal aortic arch by approximately 2.6 cm. The left subclavian artery originated from the descending aorta which was perfused by a patent ductus arteriosus of 3.9 mm. Marked vessel discrepancy between the hypoplastic ascending aorta and the dilated main pulmonary artery (PA) due to the double size of PA than the ascending aorta was observed. No hypoplasia was noted in the right ventricle (RV) and the normal coronary pattern was observed.
A single-stage primary repair was performed through the midline sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was introduced as both the ascending aorta and the PA which perfused the descending aorta through the wide patent ductus arteriosus were cannulated using a Y-shaped aortic inflow line. Cannulations of caval veins were then peformed with a right angle cannulation for the superior vena cava and a straight cannulation for the inferior vena cava. The aorta was cross-clamped at 30.2 °C core temperature during the systemic cooling and the myocardial protection was performed through infusions of the histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) cardioplegic solution into the aortic root. The left heart venting was started by making a small incision on the atrial septum as there was no patent foramen ovale. As the RV was well developed, transpulmonary VSD closure was performed with a bovine pericardial patch after transecting the pulmonary trunk 5 mm above the annulus during the cooling process. At 20.5 °C the extracorporeal perfusion was stopped, and the arterial cannula was withdrawn from the pulmonary trunk. The aortic arch was then reconstructed under hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). The left subclavian artery was doubly ligated and transected during the reconstruction with the aim to relieve the tension of anastomosis. After complete excision of the ductal tissue, a longitudinal aortotomy was performed on the inner curvature of the ascending aorta. The end of the descending aorta was then directly anastomosed with the ascending aorta. After the completion of the aortic arch reconstruction systemic arterial perfusion was resumed.
The ascending aorta was then transected 5 mm above the coronary artery (CA) to perform an arterial switch operation of the transposed great arteries. As there were no variable coronary patterns both CA were excised with buttons of the aortic wall and implanted again to the proximal neoaorta. The miss-match between the two ends of neoaorta was then corrected during the anastomosis of neoaorta with an elliptical patch of bovine pericardium used for enlargement of the distal part of the ascending aorta. For next step, the incision of atrial septum was totally closed. Anastomosis of the neo-pulmonary trunk was at last accomplished using a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium leaving the neoaorta behind the pulmonary bifurcation, which adopted the Lecompte Manouvre. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with an open sternum and a peritoneal dialysis catheter placed in the abdominal cavity. The by-pass, cross-clamping and circulatory arrest times were 265, 184, and 33 min, respectively.
The vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS), a predictor of morbidity and mortality in infants after cardiopulmonary bypass [] was 17.5 (adrenaline 0.10μg/kg.min, noradrenaline 0.05μg/kg.min, isoprenaline 0.025μg/kg.min) at the first hour after the operation and 16 (adrenaline 0.10μg/kg.min, noradrenaline 0.03μg/kg.min, milrinone 0.3μg/kg.min) after 24 h. Nitroprusside was used to reduce afterload. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 22,914.00 pg/ml the first day after the operation and decreased to 7101.00 pg/ml after 2 days. The ventilation time was 91 h and the patient stayed in the ICU for 12 days. Postoperative echocardiography and CTA showed excellent results as the systolic function of both ventricles was normal and there were no aortic or pulmonary regurgitations, Fig. . A maximum velocity of 1.7 m/s and 2.4 m/s was recorded at the neoaorta and neopulmonary anastomosis, respectively. The patient remained asymptomatic at 3 months after surgery confirmed with echocardiography demonstrating the normal systolic function of ventricles and trivial regurgitation for both aortic and pulmonary valves. The maximum velocity at the neoaorta and neopulmonary anastomosis was 1.8 m/s and 2.4 m/s, respectively.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [3.6, 'kg']}",14.4,13.68,15.12,"The patient's weight is 3.6 kg.

In CT, a sacral corridor for inserting the transiliac transsacral (TITS) screw existed, but the TITS bar was not be approved to be used in Japan, and in this osteoporotic case with dislocation of the sacrum, there was concern about fixation with the TITS screw. On the other hand, in this case, L5 and S1 were bonny fused, and we decided to perform SIRF with inserting a pedicle screw into L5 and S1, fixing the fractured bone directly, and connecting it to the iliac screw. The operation was performed 2 months after the injury and 4 days after the transfer to our hospital under general anesthesia with the patient in the prone position.
About 5 cm incisions were made to the skin bilaterally placed medial to both the posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS). The fascia was peeled away from the surfaces of the PSIS to develop sufficient space for manipulation of the iliac screws (IS) and S1 pedicle screws (S1PS). First, the bilateral S1PS were aimed at the promontory. The right L5 pedicle screw was inserted (left L5 pedicle screw was not inserted this time because it was inserted from the fractured site in the case). The entry point of the IS was set 2–3 cm distal to the head of the S1PS. With image intensifier position for the “teepee” view, a guidewire was placed from the PSIS toward the anterior inferior iliac spines (AIIS). Iliac screws (φ9.5-90 mm) were inserted []. Constructs were made using spinal instruments (Solera, Medtronic Co., Dublin, Ireland) (). The surgery time was 2 h and 56 min, and intraoperative blood loss was 95 g. Immediate weight bearing as tolerated was allowed postoperatively.
The patient continued PTH injection treatment after the surgery. CT examinations (postoperative 6 months) were performed to determine the progress of bone union (). The patient experienced no pain waking with a walking stick and returned to most social activities including living independently within 6 months of the operation. The modified Majeed score was 94 (except sexual intercourse, which was 4 points out of a possible 96) at the visit of 6 months after operation. No particular implant-related complications such as skin irritation, screw loosening, or buck out have occurred.",What is the patient's body surface area?

4555,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-4669602-1,Extracted,"A 30-year-old previously well Bangladeshi male was admitted to a local tertiary care hospital with a 20-day history of fever, chills, rigors, headache, myalgias, and anorexia. He had been suffering from nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice with scleral icterus and dark urine for five days. One day prior to admission, he was diagnosed with malaria on thick smear at a private hospital, however parasite density result was unavailable. There he was treated with intravenous quinine (750 mg 8-hourly x five doses) and azithromycin, due to limited availability of first line therapy of artesunate, before being referred for further management.
Past medical history was significant for three prior malaria infections. His most recent episode of suspected vivax malaria was 30 days prior to admission, which was partially treated with an incomplete course of chloroquine. He had no history of jaundice, liver disease, transfusions, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. There was no family history of jaundice or iron treatments. He did not take any regular or traditional medicines. There was no history of betel nut consumption.
On admission, he had a temperature of 39.7 oC, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 15/15, blood pressure (BP) 127/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 127 beats per minute, a respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 93 % on room air, and body weight of 65 kg. He appeared unwell with pronounced scleral icterus, black urine, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (4 cm and 5 cm below the costal margin, respectively). There was no conjunctival suffusion or lymphadenopathy.
Admission peripheral blood smear confirmed a diagnosis of falciparum malaria (360 parasites/μl). Severity criteria included hyperlactataemia (lactate 6.8 mmol/L), hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin 58 μmol/L), and 4+ haemoglobinuria (blackwater fever); hence the case was classified as severe malaria (Table ). He was promptly treated with intravenous artesunate 120 mg, 2.4 mg/kg body weight (Guilin Pharmaceuticals, China) at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h (four doses), in addition to empiric ceftriaxone 2,000 mg every 12 h, as per local hospital practice. After 30 h his peripheral parasites cleared with resolution of the fever and haemoglobinuria, and he was switched to oral artemether/lumefantrine (AL) combination 80/480 mg (Novartis, Switzerland).
On the third day of admission he developed fever, confusion, dyspnoea (RR 28, SaO2 90 %), tachycardia (HR 106), hypotension (BP 100/80 mmHg), recurrent 4+ haemoglobinuria with severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin of 32 g/L) accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, consistent with acute haemolytic anaemia (Table , Fig. ). Pre-transfusion peripheral blood smear showed no schistocytes and reticulocytes of 2 % (reticulocyte production index 0.15 (compared to RPI of 0.3 on day 3 in blackwater fever patients []). Direct antiglobulin test (DAT; anti-IgG and anti-C3d) was negative and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was positive. Glucose was normal. Blood and urine bacterial cultures were negative. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing and haemoglobin typing were not available. Human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology were negative. Hepatitis B antigen was negative. He promptly received transfusion of three units matched whole blood. Intravenous artesunate was substituted for AL despite parasite clearance due to the notion that the recurrent fever must be due to malaria. In total, he received seven doses of artesunate (total dose of 840 mg) and three doses of AL (total dose of artemether 240 mg, and lumefantrine 1,440 mg). Empiric amikacin 500 mg, 7.5 mg/kg 8-hourly was added on day 6 to broaden antibacterial coverage for potential multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria given his ongoing fever despite negative blood and urine cultures. The haemolysis continued for nine days and he required a total of 10 transfusions (Fig. ).
On day 10, bone marrow biopsy revealed gross hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia and no evidence of lymphoma, leukaemia, or haemophagocytic syndrome. Meropenem (500 mg 8-hourly) was empirically substituted for amikacin and ceftriaxone given his renal dysfunction to cover potential extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers, and dexamethasone 5 mg 6-hourly was initiated for suspected autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The haemoglobinuria resolved two days after steroid treatment and ceftriaxone discontinuation. His haemoglobin slowly recovered, reaching 76 g/L by day 20.
On day 16, he had ongoing fever with right-sided facial pain and swelling. A large, 3 × 2 cm ulcer on the right upper hard palate covered with yellow slough and an area of necrosis was observed (Fig. ). The right maxillary sinus was tender on palpation. He had pain with right eye extra-ocular movements but no ocular discharge, proptosis, pupil asymmetry, diplopia, or decreased visual acuity. There was no nasal or ear involvement. A swab of the hard palate ulceration revealed long, broad, aseptate hyphal elements displaying 90° branching consistent with Mucor, (Fig. ). Fungal cultures failed to grow. MRI showed extensive right-sided opacification and mucosal thickening of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with no radiographic evidence of orbital or cerebral extension (Fig. ). He underwent prompt surgical debridement of the oral ulcer and right maxillary sinus. His steroids were discontinued and he was started on oral itraconazole 100 mg 12-hourly until first line treatment with amphotericin B became available nine days later. Intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate 50 mg daily, was continued for 14 days with improvement of his facial swelling and oral ulceration. The patient was pleased with his clinical improvement and hospital care, however due to a family emergency in his remote village he left hospital against medical advice and could not attend follow up.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [65.0, 'kg']}",105.0,99.75,110.25,"The patient's weight is 65.0 kg.

3486,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-5090078-1,Extracted,"A 17-year-old female with no medical history complained of general fatigue and bradycardia from three months before. Her height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 161 cm, 45 kg, and 17.4 kg/m2, respectively. A physical examination indicated that the blood pressure and heart rate are 87/46 mmHg and 38 beats/min, respectively. Laboratory data indicated an elevation of hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 21 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 28 IU/L), hypoproteinemia (total protein, 6.1 g/dL; albumin, 3.9 g/dL), hypoglycemia (blood glucose, 67 mg/dL), and a decrease in free triiodothironene (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels (FT3, 0.87 pg/mL; FT4 0.87 ng/dL). Thyroid stimulating hormone (4.610 μIU/L) was normal. The total blood ketone level was high (114 mmol/L), but the levels of thiamin (2.7 μg/dL), cobalamin (548 pg/mL), folic acid (4.8 ng/mL), growth hormone (6.17 ng/mL), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (31.3 pg/mL) were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed bradycardia with junctional rhythm and prolonged QT interval (). A cardiac echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 45%) with apical wall motion decline of both ventricles and both ventricles were dilated (LV diastolic dimension: LVDd 52 mm) (). A coronary angiogram showed no stenosis or obstruction, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show late gadolinium enhancement. An endomyocardial biopsy revealed moderate vacuolar degeneration, hypertrophy, and attenuation of the myocardium as well as moderate interstitial fibrosis. Any inflammatory cell infiltrate, myocardial edema, or necrosis was not observed (). The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with sick sinus syndrome at the time.
An angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) was prescribed without pacemaker implantation since the fatigue was clearly not related to the bradycardia. During the follow-up, cardiac echocardiographic findings after four months did not improve (LVEF 44%, LVDd 49 mm); her body weight reduced to 34.1 kg (BMI 13.6 kg/m2) after losing 16 kg in six months, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) by a psychiatrist. The patient received nutritional counseling and appropriate psychotherapy to increase her caloric intake. One month later, her body weight increased to 43.5 kg (BMI 16.8 kg/m2), heart rate (HR) increased to 66 beats/min with sinus rhythm, and LVEF increased to 55%.

7610,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-7952321-2,Extracted,"A male child aged 1 year and 20 days who was immunized upto date was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever and breathlessness that had persisted for a week. At the time of admission, he was febrile, with severe respiratory distress (clinical respiratory score of eight) and bilateral crackles, and was on gastrostomy feeds. His weight was 8 kg, height 76 cm, head circumference 45 cm, and MUAC was 13 cm. Chest radiography revealed haziness in the bilateral lung fields, indicating pneumonia. Hemoglobin (11.3 g/dL), platelets, serum C-reactive protein (2.4 mg/L), and packed cell volume (31.3%) were all within normal limits. However, the child's leucocyte count was elevated (19,400 cells/μL)—a sign of severe infection—and blood culture revealed the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, a primary diagnosis of severe bronchopneumonia with sepsis was made. Since the child's weight was less than the 3rd percentile on WHO standardized growth charts, he was also diagnosed with growth faltering.
As the child was in respiratory failure at the time of admission, he was immediately shifted to the PICU for mechanical ventilation with high-frequency oscillation. While on the ventilator, he had a cardiac arrest, and also developed seizures and acute kidney injury. At this stage, total parenteral nutrition was started. The child remained in the PICU for 12 days, after which he was taken off the ventilator and shifted to the ward. However, after extubation, he showed neurological deficit (minimal) and poor oral feeding. He had lost 1.5 kg over the past 12 days. Hence, administration of ENDF via gastrostomy tube was initiated as the sole source of nutrition at a dose of 50 kcal/kg/day. As the child tolerated the formula well, the dose was gradually increased to 185 kcal/kg/day.
The child gained 400 g over the next 10 days and weighed 6.9 kg at the end of 23 days of hospitalization. At this stage, he showed no neurological deficit and was active. Hence, he was discharged and continued on ENDF feeds through gastrostomy tube (185 kcal/kg/day) at home. At the 2-week follow-up, the child's weight was 7.2 kg and he was doing well. Hence, minimal oral feeding was started with the intention of removing the gastrostomy tube at the first follow-up. The child continued alternate feeds between ENDF and home-cooked meals and ENDF was stopped once the child reached 9 kg of weight at 3 months post discharge and was thriving well on the WHO growth charts, post which child was completely on home cooked meals and did not need close follow up. The child demonstrated a substantially high post-discharge rate of weight gain (700 g/month). The growth chart is shown in . The child's parents were happy and have noticed the weight gain significantly higher as compared to regular feeds.

8884,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-4900239-1,Extracted,"A 17-year-old adolescent boy with Jeune syndrome underwent spinal correction. He was born abroad and immigrated to Japan when he was 5 months old. He survived infancy, although he was diagnosed with Jeune syndrome as the cause of thoracic deformity, renal dysfunction, and urinary tract abnormality at 11 months old at a university hospital. His renal condition became worse with age. He underwent a renal transplant to treat chronic renal failure at 10 years old. Although it was not clear when his spinal deformity was discovered, he had received no treatment until after he entered junior high school. He was treated with a brace at 14 years old. However, he disliked the brace and discontinued using it within a few months. His spinal deformity progressed and he was referred to our university hospital to treat scoliosis at the age of 16 years. He did not have any restriction of daily life at that time, but was worried about his trunk deformity.
He was 160 cm (−1.9 SD), 50 kg, and thus his body mass index (BMI) was 18.5 kg/m2. Physical findings were imbalance of his shoulder and waist lines, a prominent right scapula and rib hump, and left lumbar hump (Fig. ). He did not have obvious short stature or a small chest. We could not find any other abnormalities except for hypacusia. He had a scar in the center of his abdomen that was made when he received the renal transplant. The result of arterial blood gas analysis was almost normal and respiratory functional data showed moderately restrictive impairment of ventilation (vital capacity (VC) 2.25 L, %VC 54.4 %, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 100 % predicted). A peripheral blood sample was obtained and all laboratory data were normal including renal function.
His total spine radiograph showed double major curves when we first saw him. The posterior–anterior total spine radiograph showed a coronal Cobb angle of 70° (T4–L2), 82° (T12–L3), and Risser grade V. A lateral total spine radiograph showed an 81° thoracolumbar kyphosis (T9–L3) and 10° thoracic lordosis (T5–L2) (Fig. ). We considered that he had indications for surgical treatment. We classified his spinal deformity as Lenke type 6C [] and planned the fusion area and surgical strategy. The risks and benefits of spinal correction were explained and informed consent was obtained from the patient and his family.
Sufficient attention was paid to avoid compressing his transplanted kidney, which was placed around the right lower abdomen and to maintain sufficient flow though the kidney when he was fixed in a prone position. The fusion area was from T4 to L4, using pedicle screws, hooks, and sublaminar wirings as anchors. Ponte osteotomy was added from T12 to L2 to correct the kyphotic deformity. Before wound closing, autogenous bone grafting was performed. There were no intraoperative complications associated with respiratory dysfunction or the transplanted kidney. Cobb angles were corrected by 49 % to 36° (T4–T12) and 42° (T12–L3), respectively. Thoracolumbar kyphosis was corrected by 63 % to 30° (T9–L3).
Our patient could be extubated immediately after wound closure and did not need to be treated at an intensive care unit (ICU). Oxygen supply was administered routinely for a single overnight period and respiratory dysfunction was not identified in the postoperative period. Sufficient perfusion ensured no circulatory failure of the transplanted kidney occurred. He was discharged 25 days postoperatively. His most recent radiographs at 2 years after surgery showed Cobb angles of 40° (T4–12), and 42° (T12–L3), and correction losses were 4° and 0° respectively. A lateral whole spine radiograph also showed thoracic lordosis was 5° and thoracolumbar kyphosis was 28° (Fig. ). A respiratory function test was performed at one year after surgery, showing VC 2.47 L, %VC 55.7 %, and FEV1 95.9 %. There were no other complications, including surgical site infection, within 2 years of surgery. The patient and his family were thoroughly satisfied with his treatment, including the surgery.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [50.0, 'kg'], 'height': [160.0, 'cm']}",54.129,51.423,56.835,"The patient's gender is Male.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Sodium': [138.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [21.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Chloride': [98.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [3.2, 'g/dL']}",9.0,8.55,9.45,"To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 3.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 19.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.2 (in g/dL)) = 21.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 21.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 21.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 21.0 - 12 = 9.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 9.0 mEq/L."

He suffers from arterial hypertension, has a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death, and is on chronic therapy with thiazide, angiotensin II receptor blocker and statin. In November 2020, he reported fever, cough, weakness, diarrhea, and dyspnea. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. The patient was started on oral prednisone 25 mg and LMWH 6,000 UI daily. Few days after symptom onset, he entered the ED for worsening dyspnea. ABG showed hypocapnic hypoxemia and high-flow oxygen therapy and CPAP cycles were started. The patient was hospitalized and i.v., dexamethasone was initiated. Due to persistent reduced PaO2/FiO2, the patient was transferred to ICU where initial CPAP and prono-supination cycles were soon followed by OTI and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was administered. Despite therapy, the patient did not show any improvement in the lung function. Chest CT scan showed extensive lung parenchymal alterations with widespread consolidations and signs of initial evolution toward lung fibrosis. The patient was transferred to our third-level hospital to start ECMO support. He was treated with i.v. steroid therapy, anticoagulant therapy (bivalirudin, antithrombin III), and prophylactic i.v. antibiotics. The patient was progressively weaned from ventilator support and finally extubated on December 28. He continued ECMO support and NIV cycles alternated with high-flow O2 therapy. As lung function did not improve since extubation, nintedanib was started through compassionate use after obtaining the signature of the informed consent, at the dosage of 150 mg orally twice a day. Eleven days after the introduction of nintedanib, it was possible to discontinue ECMO support due to progressively improved lung function up to PaO2/FiO2 ratio normalization. The CRP levels decreased concertedly (). The patient was discharged from ICU and transferred to the Rehabilitation Unit. A chest CT scan performed 40 days after nintedanib introduction showed a consistent reduction in consolidating areas, despite the persistence of GGO and peripheral interstitial thickening. At hospital discharge (day 60), the patient was eupneic on room air at rest and necessitated oxygen support with NC at 4 L/min during exercise. A 6MWT on NC at 3 L/min uncovered exertional desaturation (the lowest value of SpO2: 78%) and nocturnal oximetry showed episodes of hypopnea necessitating CPAP during sleep. Nintedanib treatment was discontinued after 71 days. A third chest CT scan performed 1 month after nintedanib withdrawal revealed a further reduction of lung alterations, albeit with persisting diffuse GGO. At follow-up evaluation (37 days after nintedanib withdrawal), SpO2 at rest was 96% on room air and RR 21 breaths/min.

The patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 140.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 13800.0 count/µL. To convert 13800.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 13800.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 13800000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 46.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute.

The concentration of sodium is 147.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 147.0 mEq. To convert from 147.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 147.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 147.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 147.0 mmol sodium.

The patient had chronic apical periodontitis and severe periodontal disease. There was teeth movement, and it was difficult to preserve them. We planned to extract these teeth and place six implants (Figure ).
A physician had suspected the presence of VWD when the patient was aged 21 years, but no detailed testing or treatment was performed. The family history was not relevant, and the patient was on no current medications.
In terms of preoperative chest findings, the chest X-ray was normal (Figure ) with a normal cardiothoracic ratio of 42%, and there were no particular issues. Blood test results are shown in Table . The platelet count, a hemostatic factor, was 360,000/µl, the activated partial thromboplastin time was 35.4 s, and the prothrombin time was 11.7 s; all were within normal limits. However, coagulation factor VIII was 49%, VWF activity was 24%, and VWF antigen was 26% indicating that the coagulation factor was lower than normal. Based on detailed testing carried out by our hospital's hematology department, the patient was diagnosed with Type 1 VWD, in which there is a quantitative decrease in the VWF.
There was nothing of particular note in terms of family history. Implants in the upper jaw had already been placed at a different hospital, and there had been some difficulty stopping the bleeding when the teeth were extracted. In this case, after consulting with the hematology department, we decided that surgery would be possible by transfusing heat-treated factor VIII concentrate (Confact F®), which contains VWF. This transfusion was done to prevent abnormal bleeding during surgery. Furthermore, considering the risk of bleeding due to fluctuations in hemodynamics, with the patient's consent, we planned to carry out tooth extraction and implant placement under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation.
One hour before entering the operating room, 1500 units of Confact F® were transfused. In terms of transfusion volume, although we planned to carry out implant placement, it was determined that the amount of bleeding would not differ greatly from that of tooth extraction alone, so we used 25 IU/kg, basing our calculations on those published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Table ). Immediately before surgery, we took another blood sample. We confirmed that VWF activity was 127% and that coagulation factor VIII had increased to 104%. We then proceeded with the surgery. Considering that fluctuations in hemodynamics during surgery promote bleeding, intravenous sedation was performed to stabilize circulation. Oxygen (2 L/min) was administered transnasally, and cefmetazole sodium (1 g) was administered preoperatively to prevent infection. During the operation, we used midazolam iv and propofol (1% Diprivan Injection kit®) target-controlled infusion for continuous intravenous sedation. Also, 2% Xylocaine Dental® with epinephrine 1:80,000 was used for local anesthesia. The operation time was 3 h and 37 min, the anesthesia time was 4 h and 16 min, and blood loss was 405 ml. Although it was a little difficult to stop bleeding during the operation, we completed the procedure with no major problems. No postoperative complications, such as bleeding, were observed, and the prognosis was favorable. One week after the operation, evaluation of the coagulation factor VIII and VWF activity revealed that they had decreased to 48% and 23%, respectively, which were close to their preoperative values (Table ).","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [173.5, 'cm']}",69.106,65.651,72.561,"The patient's gender is Male.

The past medical history was notable for hypertension untreated and smoking 50 pack year. His height was 173 cm, and weight was 73 kg with body mass index of 24.4. The creatinine clearance was 87 ml/min. Although the preoperative history talking failed to recognize the symptoms of intermittent claudication and sensory impairment of his lower extremities, a preoperative contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a significant stenosis in bilateral external iliac artery due to arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) (Fig. ) and occlusions of bilateral internal iliac artery. There was no coagulation abnormality in his blood test or atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram.
He underwent an elective laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with a lithotomy position. There was no vascular injury or compression with laparoscopic forceps as far as we were able to recognize retrospectively based on the laparoscopic video and the memory.

In-out balance during operation divided body weight and time of operation was 6.38 ml/kg/h. The patient reported a severe pain in the left leg, when he woke up post-operatively. The left leg was pale and cold, associating sensory abnormality and motor dysfunction; left pedal and popliteal pulses were absent. A CT scan revealed the contrast interruption of left common iliac artery (CIA) over 11.5 cm and suspected to be due to an arterial thrombosis (Fig. ). Under the local anesthetic technique, the left femoral artery was exposed and performed thrombectomy with a 5Fr Fogarty catheter. After a new clot was removed, aortography revealed persistent stenosis in left iliac artery. Consequently, a Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent (Express LD 8 × 37 mm) was added (Fig. ) via left femoral artery. Blood perfusion in his left leg improved markedly immediately post PTA.

The dog ingested approximately fifty 100 mg tablets. The estimated oral dose ingested was 278 mg/kg (611.6 mg/lb). There were no other animals in the household. The dog had been healthy with no previous illnesses.
On presentation, the dog had a rectal temperature of 39.4°C (103.0°F). On physical examination, the dog had good body condition. He was tachypneic at 60 breaths per minute with clear lung fields. The mouth was rigidly closed. Abdominal palpation was soft with no intra-abdominal masses. Rectal examination revealed normal, brown stool. Neurological examination revealed a dull mentation, vertical nystagmus, severe alligator rolling with extensor rigidity in all four limbs. Cardiac examination revealed a heart rate of 160 beats per minute, and he had pale pink mucous membranes with a capillary refill time of 2 s. An intermittently irregular heart rhythm was noted.
Diagnostic testing upon presentation included an electrocardiogram and blood pressure measurement. This identified the arrhythmia as multifocal ventricular tachycardia (). The blood pressure was found to be 104 mmHg. An intravenous (IV) catheter was placed, and a balanced electrolyte solution (Plasmalyte A; Baxter International Inc, Deerfield, IL, USA) was started at three times maintenance (180 mL/kg/day). Because of the patient’s abnormal mentation and neurologic status on presentation, oral medication could not be administered and also an IV catheter could not be placed safely initially. Methocarbamol (Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Chesterbrook, PA, USA) was administered (100 mg/kg [220 mg/lb], rectally) mixed with 3 mL of saline. A lidocaine (Lidocaine hydrochloride; Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA; 2 mg/kg [4.4 mg/lb], IV) bolus was administered IV soon thereafter converting electrocardiogram to a normal sinus rhythm.
The dog was hospitalized for supportive care and monitoring. After the single methocarbamol and lidocaine doses, three times maintenance IV fluid therapy was continued; however, no further methocarbamol doses or lidocaine boluses were administered. Two hours after presentation, the patient was able to stand and ambulate with mild ataxia. A mild head tremor lastinĝ45 s was recorded at that time, which resolved on its own. Three hours after presentation, another electrocardiogram was taken, which revealed a normal heart rate, 136 beats per minute, with occasional ventricular premature complexes. Blood gas was evaluated to be normal (). Low–normal potassium was noted at 3.7 meq/L (reference range 3.6–4.9 meq/L). The dog began to eat within the first 4 h of presentation and had no further vomiting.
Three times maintenance IV fluids were administered until that evening when they were decreased to two times maintenance (120 mL/kg/day). The following day, another blood gas was taken, which revealed that all values remained within the normal limits (). An electrocardiogram was also repeated and found to have normal rate and rhythm (). By 48 h after presentation, fluids were decreased to 60 mL/kg/day, and the patient was discharged soon thereafter.
The dog was presented for recheck 72 h after original presentation. He was presented with a rectal temperature of 39.6°C (103.2°F). On physical examination, the dog was found to be in good body condition. He was panting at 60 breaths per minute. His heart rate was 125 beats per minute, and he had pink mucous membranes with a capillary refill time of 2 s. Neurological examination revealed normal mentation, normal spinal reflexes, and placing reflexes. Cardiac examination revealed normal sinus rhythm. No further arrhythmias were noted on electrocardiogram.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [18.0, 'kg']}",56.0,53.2,58.8,"The patient's weight is 18.0 kg.

The QT interval is 330 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/93 = 0.645.

She presented with a 2 day history of extreme right iliac fossa pain. She experienced heavy bleeding for one day. The last reported menstrual period was 10 weeks before presentation. She denied fevers, chills, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. Past medical, obstetric, gynaecological, and surgical histories were remarkable only for 3 uncomplicated live births and no history of sexually transmitted diseases or pelvic inflammatory disease. On examination, she was found to have a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 80 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min; she was mildly pyrexial at 37.5°C. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Gynaecological examination revealed a closed cervix and a right adnexal mass.
Serum level of β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) was 3175 IU/ml and complete blood cell count was significant for a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3 with 80% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, hematocrit of 0.30, and a platelet count of 300,000. A pelvic sonogram revealed echogenic mass in the right adnexa measuring 4×5 cm with empty uterine cavity. An abdominal sonogram showed a thickening of the appendix wall associated with a free intraperitoneal fluid.
Diagnoses of appendicitis and ectopic pregnancy were entertained preoperatively, but neither could be excluded by history, physical, laboratory, and radiology examinations.
Because of the uncertainty in diagnosis, emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed through a subumbilical incision, leading to the surprising finding of concurrent ruptured ectopic pregnancy and appendicitis. She was found to have 400 ml of blood free in the pelvis with a perforated right-sided tubal pregnancy and a grossly inflamed appendix. Right salpingectomy, appendectomy and evacuation of blood clot were performed without complications. Post-operatively the patient received intravenous antibiotics; she made an excellent recovery. She was discharged from the hospital in stable condition 3 days later with a prescription for oral antibiotics. Pathologic examination of the resected segment of appendix revealed edema and inflammation of the appendix without abscess formation, consistent with early appendicitis. Pathology of the resected right fallopian tube revealed immature placental tissue and villi consistent with ectopic pregnancy.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [37.5, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [80.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [20.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [14000.0, 'm^3']}",2,2,2,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 37.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 80.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 14000.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.

3783,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-3655504-1,Extracted,"A 77-year-old woman with a history of interstitial pneumonia and uveitis visited our institution complaining of general fatigue. Chest radiography revealed a mass in the upper lung fields (), and she was thus admitted for further examinations.
Her blood pressure was 130/71 mmHg, heart rate was 106 beats/min, body temperature was 36.8°C, and O2 saturation was 96% in room air. She had a history of smoking 15 cigarettes per day for 55 years but no history of alcohol consumption. On initial clinical examination, her weight was of 50.8 kg, height was 158 cm, body mass index was 20.3 kg/m2, and BSA was 150 m2. Mild anemia was revealed in the palpebral conjunctiva. No abnormal murmur could be heard on auscultation although dry rales were heard in both lungs.
Laboratory test results demonstrated a markedly elevated white blood cell count (266 × 102/μL; normal: 39–94 × 102/μL) with 81% neutrophils, mild anemia (red blood cell count: 322 × 104/μL; normal: 367–479 × 104/μL; hemoglobin: 9.8 mg/dL; normal: 11.5–14.9 mg/dL), elevated platelet count (56.9 × 104/μL; normal: 13–33 × 104/μL), mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 0.96 mg/dL; normal: 0.47–0.79 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen: 23.4 mg/dL; normal: 7–20 mg/dL), mild hyponatremia (133 mEq/mL; normal: 137–146 mEq/mL), mild hypercalcium (11.4 mg/mL; normal: 8.4–10 mg/dL), and markedly elevated C-reactive protein level (14.0 mg/dL; normal: 0–0.3 mg/dL). The tumor marker squamous cell carcinoma antigen was also elevated (5.5 ng/mL; normal: 0–1.5 ng/mL).
Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed interstitial shadows in both lungs. Chest CT also showed a 5.2 cm irregular mass with cavity and speculated margin in the right S3 as well as a 7.6 cm irregular mass with cavity and air bronchogram sign, which were adjacent to the pleural walls (Figures and ). A few nodules were found in the right lung. Left hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes were swollen. The pathological findings for an endoscopic biopsy specimen revealed squamous cell carcinoma (Figures and ). Abdominal CT and brain magnetic imaging showed no lesion suggestive of metastasis. Radiographic findings confirmed T4N3M0 lung cancer of stage IIIB.
After admission (), high-grade fever developed and laboratory tests revealed sustained elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein level. Therefore, the cooccurrence of a respiratory tract infection was suspected. The administration of antibiotics was initiated (sulbactam/ampicillin at 3.0 g/day for 6 days, and, subsequently, pazufloxacin at 1000 mg/day for 4 days). However, the elevated inflammatory marker levels and high-grade fever were not resolved. After administering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (loxoprofen sodium hydrate at 180 mg/day), her temperature returned to normal.
The cause of fever and elevated inflammatory reaction levels was suspected as cytokine production by tumor cells. Therefore, serum G-CSF and IL-6 levels were measured, which showed that both serum G-CSF (117 pg/mL; normal: <57.5 pg/mL) and IL-6 (83.5 pg/mL; normal: <2.41 pg/mL) levels were high. Immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimens showed positive staining with anti-G-CSF monoclonal and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (Figures and ). Therefore, diagnosis of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing tumor was established.
Although surgical treatment was considered, it was not indicated because her respiratory function was poor because of interstitial pneumonia. Chemotherapy was recommended, but she declined. Therefore, she was administered best supportive therapy. She was discharged 19 days after her admission, after which she visited our institution regularly. However, she was transferred by ambulance because of dyspnea, and she died of hypoxemia due to interstitial pneumonia exacerbation two months after diagnosis of lung cancer.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [158.0, 'cm']}",50.571,48.042,53.1,"The patient's gender is Female.

5012,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-4610393-1,Extracted,"A 43-year-old homeless African-American man presented to the intensive care unit with severe jaundice and altered mental status. The patient had an unintentional 100 lb. weight loss over the previous 6 months, along with rapid heart rate, extreme fatigue, and frequent diarrhea. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient was evaluated for nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and dehydration and was discharged home to arrange outpatient follow-up of an unspecified hepatic and thyroid defect. He had no previous history of liver disease, exposure to jaundiced people or hepatitis, exposure to hepatotoxins (such as acetaminophen), alcohol ingestion, or drug abuse and was not taking any medications. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing, cachectic man with temporal wasting who was unresponsive to external stimuli. His pulse was 150 beats/min and irregular; blood pressure 140/70 mmHg, temperature 36.7 °C, and weight 146 lb. Sclerae were icteric, but without proptosis or exophthalmos. His thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged (40 g by palpation) with a palpable thyroid thrill and audible thyroid bruit. There were no palpable thyroid nodules. Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rate and rhythm, no jugular venous distension, and no murmurs. The patient had a tender right upper quadrant on palpation of his abdomen, with hepatomegaly palpable 4–5 cm below the costal margin and no ascites. Neurologic examination revealed a resting tremor with hyperreflexia.
Laboratory data was remarkable for an elevated total bilirubin of 47.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.2–1.2 with direct bilirubin of 44.6 mg/dL, delta bilirubin of 18.5 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin of 26.1 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin of 2.8 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase of 259 U/L (AST; normal range: 8–60); alanine aminotransferase 142 U/L (ALT: normal range 14–78), alkaline phosphatase 307 U/L (normal range: 38–126 U/L); albumin 3.3 mg/dL (normal range 3.5–5.0); and prothrombin time (PT) >90 s. Complete blood count, platelets, and reticulocyte count were within reference ranges. Blood and urine toxicology (including alcohol), hepatitis A/B/C serologies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-mitochondrial antibodies, anti-gliadin antibodies, and HIV serology results were negative. Serum haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, CEA, CA 19–9, AFP measurements were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation and echocardiogram demonstrated tachycardia, preserved cardiac function with an ejection fraction of 70 %, and no evidence of congestive heart failure. Abdominal CT imaging revealed hepatomegaly without evidence of focal hepatic mass, inflammation, or vascular obstruction. The lack of a specific diagnostic cause for fulminant liver failure led to planning for hepatic biopsy to determine a potential pathologic liver defect.
Thyroid function studies revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.20 μU/mL (TSH; normal range: 0.4–4.0); total thyroxine 15.2 μg/dL (total T4; normal range 4.5–12.5); free thyroxine 9.0 ng/dL (free T4; normal range 0.89–1.80); T3 uptake 1.98 (normal range 0.9–1.3 TBI); and total triiodothyronine 3.2 ng/mL (total T3; normal range 0.6–1.71). The patient’s history of homelessness as well as reported contact with rodents (and thus rodent antigens) raised the suspicion that measured TSH values were falsely elevated due to heterophile antibody interference with the TSH assay. Heterophile antibodies consist of natural antibodies that are weak and polyspecific antibodies capable of interference with immunoassays, such as TSH []. Following removal of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) by precipitation, subsequent measurement of TSH concentration was <0.01 mU/L. Furthermore, a screen for HAMA was positive.
Based on previously published diagnostic guidelines [], a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of thyroid storm due to Graves’ disease was made and treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU; 400 mg every 6 h), potassium iodide, corticosteroids, and beta blockers was initiated by the end of the second day of hospitalization. After 24 h of treatment, free T4 and total T3 levels began to decline, while total T4 levels rose, potentially related to the acute inhibitory activity of PTU on type 1 deiodinase [, ]. Within 2–3 days of therapy, liver function studies began to improve, along with improvement of T4 levels. By day 5 of therapy, mental status and functioning improved. Corticosteroids were discontinued within 10 days of treatment. Scleral icterus and jaundice resolved by day 15 of treatment. From days 10–25, thyroxine levels dropped below normal control concentrations, and thionamides and iodide were briefly discontinued. Of note, thionamide therapy with PTU was initiated at the outset of treatment, but briefly substituted with methimazole due to concern over hepatic toxicity. These concerns were ultimately unfounded, as a lower dosage of PTU (200 mg every 8 h) was reintroduced by one month after treatment initiation and was maintained with dramatic improvement of total bilirubin, AST, and ALT levels (detailed in Fig. ). Hepatic synthetic activity also dramatically improved as prothrombin time and albumin concentrations returned to reference ranges within 2–3 weeks. Alkaline phosphatase concentrations improved by one month of treatment, but not completely to normal ranges, prompting an evaluation of bone and liver isoenzymes, which were both elevated; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase of 88 IU/L (normal range: 0–55) and liver-specific alkaline phosphatase of 278 IU/L (normal range: 16–70) by 2 weeks of therapy. By 4 weeks after treatment, the patient was moved to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, where he subsequently gained weight and improved his functional conditioning while continuing PTU therapy. Prior to discharge from the hospital, an I-123 uptake and nuclear scan was performed revealing diffuse 74 % uptake at 2 h and 43 % uptake at 24 h. He was subsequently treated with 18.7 mCi of I-131 for ablative therapy.
Given his severe liver failure during thyrotoxicosis, previous studies have suggested that an underlying defect in bilirubin metabolism could be aggravated by thyrotoxicosis [, ]. In order to test for the presence of genetic mutations affecting bilirubin metabolism, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a commercially available kit (Genetra systems, Inc.) and followed by automated DNA sequencing [] at a reference laboratory at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The patient was found to be heterozygous for Gilbert’s syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterized by mild, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or hemolysis. Gilbert’s syndrome is due to the presence of genetic defects in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, which encodes the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme and is a key component for efficient biliary excretion of bilirubin []. Patients with Gilbert’s syndrome possess an additional TA repeat in the TATAA element of the 5′ promoter of the gene ((TA)7TAA rather than the normal (TA)6TAA), but patients with heterozygous mutations for Gilbert’s syndrome are often asymptomatic and do not exhibit hyperbilirubinemia. Furthermore, the patient did not have suppression or absence of albumin-bound delta bilirubin, a phenomenon reported during hyperbilirubinemia secondary to hemolysis or Gilbert’s syndrome [].","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [146.0, 'lbs']}",106.224,100.913,111.535,"The patient's weight is 146.0 lbs so this converts to 146.0 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 66.224 kg.

Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (66.224 kg - 20 kg) = 106.224 mL/hr.

On her medical history; she had previously been admitted for similar complaints and underwent surgery. Right adrenalectomy was made seven years ago and pathology result was pheochromocytoma. She had been discharged with a cure and a recommendation of interval follow-ups. But, the patient did not attend any follow-up visits nor receive any treatments over the last seven years. She started to complain of similar symptoms again since last year. On physical examination; she had cyanosis and edema on both hands and feet. The patient's blood pressure was 215/165 mm Hg, and her pulse rate was 137 beats per minute. Biochemical and radiological examinations were performed to determine recurrent pheochromocytoma. Urinary and plasma catecholamine levels were high. Urinary normetanephrine level was 30084 µg/24 h (reference values are 63-402 µg/24 h), urinary metanephrine level was 1452 µg/24 h (reference values are 32-167 µg/24 h), plasma noradrenalin level was 17540 pg/mL (reference values are 0-400 pg/mL). Contrast enhanced abdominal MRI was performed with a large mass within the left adrenal gland, measuring 65 × 50 mm in size. It was hypointense on T1-weighted and heterogeneous hyperintense on T2-weighted image with intense enhancement on post-contrast images (), suggesting residue or recurrence of the adrenal pheochromocytoma. Cranial MRI was performed because of serious headaches. T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed abnormal hyperintense signals on bilateral caudate, lentiform nuclei, dentate nuclei and periventricular and deep white matter (). Furthermore, there were two hematomas; a chronic hematoma with peripheral hemosiderin rim on the right external capsule measuring 3 × 1 cm in size and a subacute hematoma on the right globus pallidus measuring 1 cm in diameter (). There was increased diffusion in the lesions consistent with the vasogenic edema. These findings were consistent with severe PRES for the involvement of periventricular and deep white matter and deep gray matter as well as parenchymal hematomas.
On the tenth day of anti-hypertensive therapy, we obtained follow-up cranial MRI with additional SWI sequence. There was remarkable regression of vasogenic edema with near completed resolution of T2 high signal intensities on periventricular and deep white matter, and complete loss of edema on caudate, lentiform, and dentate nuclei (). On SWI, many millimetric foci of hypointensity suggesting micro hemorrhages were observed on bilateral basal ganglia, periventricular white matter and brain stem (). These microhemorrhagic foci were not detectable on conventional MRI. Reversible high signal intensities supported that this condition was PRES secondary to hypertension. SWI sequence revealed many micro and macro hemorrhagic foci of hypertensive encephalopathy as a complication of untreated chronic hypertension.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [215.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [165.0, 'mm hg']}",181.667,172.584,190.75,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

He initially experienced symptoms of bilateral lower extremity lesions four months prior to presentation, during which surgical biopsy of a left lateral calf mass yielded necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with Cryptococcus. During that admission, he was treated with amphotericin and flucytosine and discharged home on oral fluconazole. These cutaneous lesions persisted and he was treated with periodic incision and drainage of these areas; however, this new lesion on his left lower extremity appeared over several weeks prior to this admission and brought him to the emergency room. His physical exam was remarkable for the following skin findings: (1) the anterolateral aspect of his right thigh had two fluctuant, well-circumscribed, circular lesions approximately 3 cm in diameter that were tender to palpation and nonmobile and (2) his left lower extremity had a fleshy-appearing, pinkish, ovular exophytic mass approximately 5 cm in diameter that was tender to palpation and appeared to be growing over an area of previous Cryptococcus infection ().
His laboratories showed a repeat absolute CD4 count of 93 CMM, HIV RNA PCR of 117 copies/mL, and CBC significant for a normocytic, normochromic anemia (with an otherwise unremarkable differential). Given the different appearance of his new left lower extremity lesion, a repeat biopsy was performed. The biopsy of the cutaneous lesion revealed sheets of large cells with an abundant amount of cytoplasm with plasmacytoid features and increased mitosis (). In some areas, there was an increased number of tingible body macrophages noted. Immunohistochemical analysis identified malignant lymphoid cells that expressed CD138, CD79a, OCT-2, BOB-1, and MUM-1 with high mitotic rate as noted by Ki67, while the lymphoma cells were negative for CD20, CD30, and HHV-8. A cMYC rearrangement was detected by FISH. Flow cytometric analysis also supported the virtual absence of B-cell markers in the tumor cells. These findings were consistent with plasmablastic lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy was performed which was negative for any bone marrow involvement, and a staging CT scan showed a pulmonary nodule identified in the left lower lobe which is 1.8 × 1.8 cm in diameter (), a left perirectal soft tissue mass 2.0 × 2.2 cm in diameter (), and a focal area of left anal wall thickening 2.4 × 1.6 cm in diameter.

Two months prior, the patient fell during mountain climbing, resulting in a painful left chest. He was conscious when he was injured and started coughing. He went to the local hospital emergency department, and a chest CT showed a “left posterior mediastinum mass”. The patient received conservative treatment for the pain. As the patient kept experiencing symptoms, such as coughing and feeling uncomfortable, he came to our hospital for further treatment. The patient had a 4-year history of hypertension, for which he took 20 mg/day of sustained-release nifedipine. This was enough to keep his blood pressure stable within the normal range. He had no family history and no history of diabetes, surgery, or smoking and drinking. He is 162 cm in height and weighed 49.3 kg. His physical examination revealed heavy breathing sounds, but no other abnormalities were found. His blood pressure was 138/81 mmHg, heart rate 88 beats/min, respiratory rate 21 beats/min, and temperature 36 °C. His laboratory tests, such as CRP, blood routine, liver and kidney function, tumor markers, and blood gas analysis were all within the normal range. His fasting blood glucose was 7 mmol/l. His chest enhanced CT suggested: 1. Left posterior mediastinal mass, and therefore a neurogenic tumor was considered; 2. Chronic bronchitis, emphysema, multiple pulmonary bullae in the apex of both lungs; 3. Little inflammation in the lower right lung (Fig. ). No obvious abnormality was found on his ECG, nor by abdominal and cardiac ultrasound. The pulmonary function examination displayed “Mildly restrictive pulmonary ventilation dysfunction”. Given these characteristics, our initial diagnosis was: “left posterior mediastinum tumor; chronic bronchitis; hypertension”. The patient continued to use nifedipine after admission, and his blood pressure was well-controlled.
On March 28, 2018, the patient underwent thoracoscopic mediastinal tumor resection under general anesthesia. When he arrived in the operation room, the invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP), electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation (SPO2), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) were measured for baseline values and were continued to be monitored throughout the surgery. The baseline ABP was 147/78 mmHg, HR was 85 beats per min (bpm), and the SPO2 was 98%. Intravenous anesthesia was induced and he was intubated successfully. During the operation, intravenous anesthesia, combined with inhalation anesthesia, was used. The patient was placed in the right lateral position for thoracoscopic surgery. The ABP (115–140/64-80 mmHg) and HR (80-89 bpm) were stable but suddenly increased during the exploration of the tumor. His ABP sharply increased to 214/81 mmHg, HR increased to 110 bpm, and the SPO2 was steady at 97%. Deeper anesthesia and urapidil (10 mg) iv were used to attempt to control the hypertension, but this was ineffective. The anesthesiologist suspected that the tumor was secreting catecholamines. Nicardipine was given as a continuous infusion at 2 ~ 10 μg/(kg.min) to control the blood pressure. Esmolol 0.5 mg/kg was repeatedly administered to control the heart rate, and 500 ml colloid solution was given to expand the blood volume. When the patient’s blood pressure returned to 140/63 mmHg, and the heart rate dropped to 95 bpm, Nicardipine and Esmolol were discontinued while the tumor was completely removed. After tumor resection, the patient showed circulatory fluctuations again, with the ABP decreasing between 101 and 110/59–80 mmHg and the HR between 95 and 104 bpm. After reducing the depth of the anesthesia, the patient’s blood pressure still showed a decreasing trend (ABP 74/45 mmHg, HR 97 bpm, SPO2 96%). The liquid infusion rate was increased, and 0.03 ~ 0.15 μg/(kg.min) norepinephrine was given to maintain the blood pressure at 100–110/60–70 mmHg. During the whole operation (3 h), a total of 2600 ml liquid was injected into the patient, of which 500 ml was colloidal liquid. Surgical bleeding was 300 ml, and the urine volume was 300 ml. Considering the intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations, the patient was transferred to the ICU for intensive care after surgery. The vasoactive agents were continuously decreased under surveillance. Four hours after the operation, the patient’s hemodynamics returned to a stable state, and the endotracheal tube was successfully removed. The patient was transferred back to the ward on the first day after surgery. The drainage tube was removed on the third day after the operation, and he was discharged after ten days.
Postoperative immunohistochemistry results showed that the tumor was positive for CgA, CD56, NSE, and SYN (Fig. ), and negative for CK (AE1/AE3), MelanA, ki-67, and s-100. The mass was diagnosed as PGL by postoperative immunohistochemical tests (neuroendocrine markers (CgA, CD56, SYN) were positive) and by a chest enhanced CT scan (uniform enhancement of the tumor).
The patient was followed up in the outpatient clinic for over a year and did not present with recurrences or metastasis of the tumor, and his blood pressure and heart rate remained stable at 135/77 mmHg and 76 bpm with o.p. sustained-release nifedipine.",What is the patient's body surface area?

Historical workup more than 5 years prior for congenital hypotonia, delayed acquisition of motor skills, persistent discoordination, and chronic fatigue included a muscle biopsy with pathologic examination and oxidative phosphorylation enzymology as well as a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and multi-gene panel for cellular energetic defects including 656 genes. Skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation enzymology was equivocal for a possible complex 1 defect and decreased enzymatic activity of complex 1 was observed. Although no associated mitochondrial DNA defect was identified, she acquired a diagnosis of possible MM. Gene sequencing revealed a variant of uncertain significance, reported with conflicting predictions of “possibly damaging” and “tolerated,” in the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene (Position Chromosome 19: 38955314, Exon 23, Variant c.[2822C > T]), suggestive of possible MH susceptibility. There was no family history of MH. Additional studies included normal electromyography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echo. Her past medical history was otherwise notable for fibromyalgia/chronic musculoskeletal pain, possible spondyloarthropathy, endometriosis, adnexal cyst, and ectopic pregnancy. She had undergone prior surgical procedures with neuraxial or peripheral nerve blockade. She was warned by medical providers elsewhere to avoid propofol, lactated Ringer’s solution, and succinylcholine.
Given this history, we favored regional anesthesia and the surgical service agreed to an open rather than the originally scheduled laparoscopic procedure. She was pre-medicated with 1 gram (g) oral acetaminophen and intravenous (IV) fentanyl 50 micrograms (mcg) and midazolam 3 milligrams (mg). A combined spinal epidural procedure was performed with the patient sitting upright and with midline approach at lumbar interspace 3–4 with an 18 gauge Tuohy needle, 27 gauge Whitacre needle, and 20 gauge epidural catheter. Loss of resistance with preservative-free normal saline was obtained at 6 cm. Intrathecal injection of 2 milliliters (mL) 0.75% bupivacaine with 8.25% dextrose, 15 mcg fentanyl, and 200 mcg epinephrine was performed. The epidural catheter threaded easily and a test dose of 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 5 mcg/mL epinephrine was negative for intrathecal or intravascular catheter location. Approximately 30 min later, the patient had a dermatomal level around thoracic (T) spinal nerve T8, so the catheter was bolused with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine. After confirming T6 dermatomal level, incision was made. Anesthesia was maintained with divided doses of 10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 5 mcg/mL epinephrine and 10 mL 2% lidocaine. For sedation, in addition to previously mentioned pre-medications, she received IV divided doses of 30 mg ketamine, 9 mg midazolam, and 550 mcg fentanyl. For antiemetics she received 0.625 mg droperidol IV, 4 mg dexamethasone IV, and 4 mg ondansetron IV. She was maintained on a 5% dextrose and normal saline IV infusion at 100 mL/hour with intraoperative point-of-care glucose monitoring. Baseline and perioperative lactates were not monitored, although in retrospect we would include this laboratory evaluation. Skin temperature was monitored and normothermia was maintained with a forced air warmer. Surgical time was 4 h and included Pfannenstiel incision, lysis of adhesions, and left ovarian cystectomy. At the conclusion of the case the surgeons infiltrated the wound with a solution of 20 mL 1.3% liposomal bupivacaine in 100 mL normal saline and the epidural catheter was removed.

He fell ill after heavily consuming alcohol for a day. Three and a half hours prior to his arrival, he experienced discomfort in his chest followed by vomiting. Two hours and 20 min prior to his arrival, he felt nauseated, describing a feeling of sudden stiffness throughout his entire upper body. On arrival, he was alert, his blood pressure was 139/98 mmHg, pulse rate was 64/min and regular, body temperature was 36.5 °C, respiratory rate was 20/min, and oxygen saturation was 95%. He was 173 cm tall and weighed 73.1 kg. No abnormalities other than cold sweat and epigastric tenderness were noted on physical examination. Chest radiography of the lateral view (seated position) showed several areas of free-air just below the diaphragm (Fig. ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed free-air, bilateral pleural effusion, and a dilated esophagus and stomach (Fig. ). Based on these findings, an esophageal rupture with mediastinitis was the definitive conclusion and he was thus diagnosed with Boerhaave syndrome. A subsequent esophagogram further confirmed the diagnosis. Nine hours after the onset of the rupture, an emergency operation was performed as follows. Through a left thoracoabdominal incision, closure of the perforation and drainage of both the mediastinum and thoracic/abdominal cavities were performed in succession. The penetrating laceration was approximately 3 cm in length vertically on the left posterior wall of the distal esophagus and was patched with the patient’s omentum. Although the patient had a complication of anastomotic insufficiency on the 16th day, it was ultimately resolved. The patient was then administered a liquid diet on the 35th day, and he was discharged on the 41st day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on the 98th day, and a scar due to the suture was observed in the same location as the previous perforation (Fig. ).",What is the patient's body surface area?

She complained of exertional dyspnea and weakness. She married at the age of 25. After that time, she developed drooping of her eyes, with the left eye drooping more than the right eye. Her symptoms persisted and they had gradually increased during about the last 10 yr. About 8 yr ago, she underwent a ptosis repair operation at a local clinic, but her symptoms were not improved. She denied a history of loss of consciousness, headache, dysphagia, dysarthria and myalgia. There was no family history of similar symptoms and no history of trauma. There was no previous history of diabetes and hypertension.
On examination, she was determined to be 151 cm in height and 48 kg in weight. The initial vital signs were a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 68 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 20/min. She was lethargic and had facial puffiness and no goiter. The lung and heart examinations were unremarkable. All the extremities showed pitting. She had marked bilateral ptosis, while the external ocular movements were normal (). The other cranial nerve examinations were unremarkable.

The urinary analysis was negative for blood and protein with using a dipstick. As the clinical findings suggested hypothyroidism and myasthenia gravis, a thyroid function test and acetylcholine receptor binding antibody test were done. The serum T3 was 0.195 ng/mL (normal reference: 0.86-2.02 ng/mL), the free T4 was 0.08 ng/dL (normal reference: 0.93-1.705 ng/dL), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.08 µIU/mL (normal reference: 0.27-4.2 µIU/mL), the antimicrosomal antibody was 17 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-34 IU/mL), the antithyroglobulin antibody was 20.1 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-114 IU/mL) and the acetylcholine receptor binding antibody was negative.
Secondary hypothyroidism was suspected. We performed a careful history taking and other pituitary hormone evaluations. At the age of 26 the patient delivered her daughter and she had a history of massive postpartum vaginal bleeding. Thereafter she not resumed menses. The basal levels of other hormones were a serum cortisol of 4.03 µg/dL, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 29.64 pg/mL, the growth hormone (GH) was 0.06 ng/mL, the IGF-1 was 25 ng/mL (normal reference: 71-263 ng/mL), the prolactin was 1.59 ng/mL, the luteinizing hormone (LH) was 1.49 IU/L, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.91 IU/L, the E2 was 17.29 pg/mL and the testosterone was 0.02 ng/mL. The combined pituitary stimulation test, including the insulin tolerance test, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test showed panhypopituitarism (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a finding of an empty sella turcica and there was no evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrhage and aneurysm ().
Nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) of the limbs reveled normal results with the exception of incidentally detected carpal tunnel syndrome. Needle EMG of the orbicularis oculi showed no evidence of dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction.
We diagnosed her as having Sheehan's syndrome, bilateral ptosis and subclinical myopathy caused by secondary hypothyroidism. Replacement with prednisolone of 10 mg/day and thyroxine (T4) 100 µg/day was started. The dose of prednisolone was decreased to 5 mg/day after 4 weeks.

3044,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-8204462-1,Extracted,"A 35-year-old nulliparous Arab woman with an 8-year history of primary infertility presented to our infertility center. During these 8 years, she was diagnosed with uterus didelphys with two cervices and no vaginal septum (Fig. ). She underwent hysterosalpingogram (HSG), three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US), and diagnostic laparoscopy, which proved the diagnosis (Fig. ). Hence, no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done since the 3D US was enough to determine the sizes of both horns, which showed minor differences in dimensions.
She had no specific history, apart from her irregular period explained by the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), was not a smoker, and did not consume alcohol. Her weight was 87 kg and her height 158 cm.
Her spouse was 44 years old, with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, a recent history of coronary angioplasty and stents, and chronic hypertension.
They had three previous failed intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) trials outside our center years prior due to an indication for a male factor (oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia).
The couple was very anxious, depressed, and distressed at the first consultation, to which they brought a new semen analysis showing azoospermia.
The male, who had a medical condition, declined any intervention to extract the sperm surgically per recommendations from the anesthesiologists and cardiologists. A diagnosis of retrograde ejaculation was made, as well as a plan for isolation of the sperm from a urine sample after the preparation. Three vials of frozen motile sperm were obtained before embarking on the fourth IVF trial.
Four blastocysts were obtained from the first IVF/ICSI antagonist cycle in February 2018 (Table ), one of which (4AA) was transferred to the left uterus, and surplus freezing was done. The patient tolerated the procedure very well with no need for sedation or anesthesia. Her vital signs were normal (blood pressure 118/67 mmHg, heart rate 73 beats per minute, temperature 36.7 °C).
Both horns had a highly suitable endometrium, with a triple line with an average thickness of 10.3 mm. The left horn was chosen because it was more accessible to the left cervix at the moment of embryo transfer. It was planned to transfer one embryo, and the couple was counseled by our high-risk-pregnancy consultant to improve the obstetrics outcome for this uterine anomaly.
The first successful IVF journey ended with no need for cerclage and with no obstetrical complication by an elective C-section at 35 weeks for a baby girl of 2800 g weight, 46 cm length, 31.5 cm head circumference, and 7/10 Apgar score at delivery.
The couple visited our infertility center again in 2020 with the goal of conceiving a second child. The first child was with them, showing very good progress, normal development, and intelligence as per her parents. They extended their request to transfer one of the frozen embryos.
The endometrium was prepared by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) protocol for embryo transfer for the frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle using 6 mg ethinyl estradiol daily starting from second day of period. Progesterone was added on day 14, when reaching triple-line endometrium with thickness of 11.1 mm. One blastocyst was thawed and survived. The initial decision was to transfer the embryo to the same horn (left) because of the previous successful transfer. The very deep and long vagina forced us to reach one of the cervices. The outer sheet of the embryo transfer catheter was used and showed that we were targeting the right horn.
Embryo transfer proceeded successfully and smoothly (Fig. ), in which the embryo was placed in the right uterus without changing or manipulating the anatomy, and the embryo was placed 1 cm from fundus. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the couple was counseled properly.
Nine days later, her beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) level was 258 mIU/ml. A single gestational sac with a viable pregnancy (positive heart beat) was observed in the right uterus, and the patient was referred to our high-risk-pregnancy specialist for follow-up.

Table presents the term-course of her clinical data. She has a height of 157 cm and a weight of 66 kg, and her serum total IgE level was 580 IU/mL. Based on the omalizumab dose table, she was started on a biweekly administration of 375 mg omalizumab. At week 16, we conducted an evaluation to assess whether the drug should be continued. We observed an improvement in the patient’s subjective symptoms and morning peak expiratory flow levels. The level of airway obstruction had improved according to the respiratory function tests, and because there were no exacerbations within 16 weeks, we decided to continue omalizumab administration. Because there were no clear aggravations, we continued treatment with omalizumab at the same dose for 36 months. We measured her serum free IgE levels at 2, 4, 8, and 26 weeks after initiating omalizumab and found that the serum free IgE levels were extremely low at 72.8, 40.50, 18.1, and 11.3 ng/dL, respectively (Fig. ). Because her symptoms had stabilized after initiating omalizumab with no exacerbations, she inquired whether it was possible to reduce the frequency of administration from once every 2 weeks to once every 4 weeks. Her ACT scores in the past 6 months were 23–25, her morning peak expiratory flow was stable, and there were no exacerbations in the past year; hence, we accepted her request and reduced the frequency of administration from biweekly to monthly without changing the dose of 375 mg omalizumab per administration beginning from August 2016. Therefore, the dosage was reduced by half. The serum free IgE trough level transiently increased to 129.3 ng/mL at 4 weeks after reducing the dosage; however, thereafter, the serum free IgE level decreased to 93.6 ng/mL within 4 weeks and gradually to 20.6 ng/mL, which is well below the desired level, 30 ng/mL (Fig. ).

A double-J stent was inserted and the patient began taking an NSAID (ibuprofen 400 mg q 8 h) and prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) for approximately 6 weeks. She was also advised to stop using opium. After 9 months, the NSAID and prednisolone were tapered off, and improvements in the patient’s clinical manifestation and radiologic and laboratory findings were observed.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [40, 'years'], 'creatinine': [2.5, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Female'}",24.323,23.107,25.539,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

766,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-7991460-1,Extracted,"A 66-year-old female with ESRD secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis presented to our hospital complaining of bilateral lower extremity pain. Her past medical history included coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic atrial fibrillation on warfarin for 3 years. She had progressed to ESRD and had been started on thrice-weekly HD 5 months prior to presentation. Physical examination was notable for several tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules with necrosis on her thighs and calves bilaterally (Fig. ).
The monthly biochemical data and dialysis clearance profiles are shown in Table . Her outpatient dialysis clearance was inadequate and her bone mineral parameters were uncontrolled prior to presentation. Other pertinent laboratory findings on presentation included a C-reactive protein level of 25.90 mg/L (normal, <10 mg/L) and homocysteine >50 µmol/L (normal, 5–15 µmol/L). Notably, she was taking calcium acetate as a phosphate binder and receiving intravenous paricalcitol, a 1,25-vitamin D analog, with each outpatient dialysis treatment.
She underwent an extensive investigation during the index admission for presumed CUA. A magnetic resonance imaging scan, without use of intravenous gadolinium, demonstrated areas of abnormal signal intensity within the thigh muscles highly suggestive of soft-tissue calcification. Echocardiography showed severe mitral valve calcification with restriction of both leaflets, as well as severe sclerosis of the aortic valve; both had advanced compared with echocardiography performed 6 months prior to admission. A non-iodinated contrast computerized tomography scan of the chest revealed extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries, mitral valve, aorta, bronchial walls, and small arteries supplying the breasts, axillae, and chest wall.
A punch skin biopsy was performed − instead of a wedge biopsy, to avoid complications such as infection, bleeding, and pain − on the periphery of the subcutaneous lesion on her left thigh corresponding to the increased signal intensity on the MRI. This yielded a mural calcification of a single deep dermal blood vessel without microvascular thrombosis, necrosis, or extravascular calcium and phosphate deposits (Fig. ).
Serial bone scintigraphy demonstrated metastatic pulmonary CUA. Five months prior to admission, a bone scintigraphy was obtained to evaluate the cause of her rib pain (Fig. ); it showed no activity in the lungs or soft tissues. The bone scintigraphy at the time of CUA diagnosis, however, demonstrated extensive increased activity throughout the lungs and lower extremities (Fig. ).
The clinical diagnosis of CUA was made based on the physical characteristics of the lesions, risk factors, and bone scintigraphy, despite having no histological evidence of microvessel thrombosis or necrosis on the punch skin biopsy. We excluded other differential diagnoses of CUA, such as warfarin necrosis, cholesterol embolization, atherosclerosis, ischemic ulcers, and early stages of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
After CUA was diagnosed, lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol®) 500 mg 2 tablets with meals, in lieu of calcium-containing oral phosphate binders, was initiated to control her bone mineral parameters. Warfarin was discontinued, due to its ability to inactivate vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of matrix Gla protein (MGP). There were no alternative anticoagulants offered, since the patient was deemed at high risk for bleeding after the skin biopsy. HD was optimized to improve her dialysis clearance.
Despite adequate dialysis clearance and optimal control of bone mineral parameters, a repeat bone scintigraphy performed 1 month after the diagnosis showed no changes in metastatic CUA (Fig. ). Because of the lack of clinical improvement, we initiated treatment with STS after each HD session, beginning at a dose of 5 g intravenously with titration to 10 g. The patient did not experience gastrointestinal side effects or develop metabolic acidosis from STS. Clinically, we observed slight improvement of the localized CUA on the patient's thighs, but the metastatic pulmonary CUA on the last bone scintigraphy obtained 2 months after the diagnosis remained unchanged (Fig. ).
Severe pain from CUA and depression marked her hospital course. Poor nutrition, as evident by her low serum albumin and phosphorus, failed to heal her CUA lesions. She requested cessation of all treatment 2 months after the diagnosis, and she expired shortly thereafter. There was no autopsy performed.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Female', 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': True, 'Hypertension history': True, 'Diabetes history': False, 'Vascular disease history': True, 'age': [66, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': True, 'Stroke': True}",7,7,7,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.

Along with these manifestations, the family noticed a yellowish discoloration of the sclera. The patient was in optimal health, with no significant medical complaints, until 2 weeks prior to hospital admission, a time when he developed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., a sore throat, cough, and mild subjective fever). One week later, he developed diarrhea with a frequency greater than 5 times daily. The diarrhea was yellowish in color and without blood. Furthermore, the diarrhea was associated with epigastric pain and vomiting, and it resolved a few days later; however, the epigastric pain became more severe, and his vomiting continued. Due to this situation, the patient had been unable to maintain his usual appetite and had lost some weight. The patient also reported a decrease in the amount of his urine and a change of the urine's color, which was described by the mother as tea-colored. No rash or edema was reported.
The patient was referred to our tertiary hospital by a dispensary after their results revealed red and granular casts in the urine and abnormal kidney function.
An initial assessment revealed that the patient had a rapid but regular heart rate of 118 beats/min. His respiratory rate was 20/min, his blood pressure was 119/61 mmHg, and his oxygen saturation was 100%.
Examination showed that the patient was conscious and oriented; he was pale and had yellowish sclera but exhibited no other significant signs (i.e., no periorbital or lower limb edema, skin rash, or petechia). His chest was clear, and the heart sounds were normal, with no additional sounds or murmurs. A neurological examination was unremarkable.
Based on the initial assessment and the laboratory work-up, (Table ) hemolytic uremic syndrome was strongly suspected due to the presence of the classical triad of the disease. The diagnosis of PSGN was unlikely for several reasons, although the patient had a high ASO titer; this only confirmed a previous exposure and not an infection. Additionally, another more probable disease, i.e., HUS, better explained the abnormal kidney function and urine analysis. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a throat swab results and get an evidence of a streptococcal infection. Thus, PSGN could not be completely ruled out.
There are few similar cases reported in the literature involving patients with SLE who initially present with HUS , , , , , . (Table )

6095,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-8642045-1,Extracted,"A 62-year-old male patient with a history of kidney failure secondary to amyloidosis
presented with chills, rigors, epigastric tenderness, and diarrhea. A tiny granuloma with
scanty discharge at the exit site and a turbid peritoneal dialysate were observed the day
before admission.
He was anuric and had been on PD for 13 years, with a CAPD dialysis regimen as follows:
2.5% 2.5 L glucose dialysate with three exchanges in the daytime, plus an additional
exchange with 7.5% 2 L icodextrin dialysate overnight. He performed CAPD bag exchanges
himself and was known to have a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
and hypertension. His CAPD regimen showed 600 mL/day of ultrafiltration, which was mainly
attributable to icodextrin use. The International Society for PD released guidelines in
2000 regarding ultrafiltration failure (UF failure), which defined UF failure using the
3 × 4 rule (), which declares that ultrafiltration failure exists if net ultrafiltration
is <400 mL following drainage of a 4% (3.86% or 4.25%, dependent on pharmacopeia)
dialysis solution that has stayed intraperitoneally for 4 h. Thus, in this instance,
ultrafiltration failure has not occurred.
A review of his home records indicated blood pressure readings ranging from 100/70 to
140/90 mmHg. Daily net ultrafiltration ranged from −400 to −900 mL, while the daily fluid
intake was ∼500 mL.
Upon admission, he had a fever of 38.5 °C and elevated blood pressure (150/83 mmHg). His
heart rate was 78 bpm. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95% in ambient air. His
body weight (without PD) was 57.8 kg, and his body mass index was 19.3 kg/m2.
No edema was noted. He had reduced appetite but good compliance with drug and fluid
intake. On physical examination, there was guarding and abdominal rigidity, but bowel
sounds were present. He had good knowledge of peritonitis, including probable entry
routes, symptoms, and interventions for a suspected occurrence. Thus far, the overall
clinical manifestations of this patient receiving PD (e.g., the new onset of abdominal
pain as evidenced by the presence of abdominal guarding, fever, and appearance of cloudy
effluent) strongly suggested the presence of CAPD-associated peritonitis ().
Laboratory testing data are shown in . Hematologic investigations revealed
anemia (hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL; hematocrit 31.5%), while a blood chemistry panel showed
hyponatremia (132 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (2.09 mmol/L), hypokalemia (3.2 mmol/L),
hypoalbuminemia (30 g/L), and significantly elevated creatinine (1,089 µmol/L), with an
estimated glomerular filtration rate of 4.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, signifying stage-5
chronic kidney disease.
The PD adequacy, as reflected by Kt/Vurea, was 1.78 weekly, which indicated
borderline adequacy. Dialysis adequacy is a broad concept and includes fluid balance,
small solute clearance, removal of uremic toxins of medium or large molecular weight, and
maintenance of nutritional status. Kt/Vurea is a consistent predictor of
survival in PD patients () and is, therefore, an important
monitoring parameter. The total (peritoneal and kidney) small-solute clearance should be a
total Kt/Vurea of ≥1.7 per week (). The peritoneal equilibration
test (PET) classified the patient as an average transporter (4 h dialysate to plasma ratio
of creatinine [D/P creatinine], 0.791; 4 to 0 h dialysate glucose ratio [D/D0 glucose],
0.334). PET is used to characterize the capacity for transportation of the patient’s
peritoneal membrane (). Transport capacity assists in deciding on the dwell time and is also a
central factor in determining the morbidity and mortality of PD patients (). Generally,
patients with a high peritoneal transport status will find it beneficial to receive APD
treatment employing lower dwell time, whereas patients with low peritoneal transport
status may find treatments with longer dwell times, e.g., CAPD, more beneficial ().
PD effluent showed the following cell counts: white blood cell (WBC),
3,157/mm3; polymorphonuclear neutrophilic cell (PMN), 97%; lymphocytes, 3%;
and eosinophils, 2%. A small amount of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive
to gentamicin, was cultured from the exit site, and the PD effluent culture revealed a
small amount of Streptococcus mitis, which was sensitive to penicillin G.
Apart from these clinical elements, the provisional diagnosis of CAPD-associated
peritonitis was confirmed by the presence of a dialysis effluent WBC count >100
cells/mm3 (following a 120 min minimum dwell time) with PMNs >50% and
positive effluent culture (; ).
The patient was able to complete the activities of daily living independently. There was
a strong bond among family members, who provided physical and emotional support to the
patient with his daily PD care. He lived with his wife and son, both of whom were
incredibly supportive of the patient and provided constant assistance in delivering
high-quality PD care at home.
The patient accepted that his kidney failure was a chronic illness. He remained the
primary source of income for his family and was employed as an engineer at a construction
company, which enabled him to be financially independent. He needed to perform one CAPD
bag exchange at work daily. However, his work environment was not an ideal place for bag
exchange because of the narrow space, dust, poor hygiene status, and central
air-conditioning systems. During the patient interview, details regarding the hygiene
status at work that may lead to CAPD-associated peritonitis were assessed. However, he
could not leave his job and admitted that he did not turn off the fan or close doors and
windows during CAPD bag exchanges because of the stuffy summer weather. Many researchers
have demonstrated that airborne bacteria concentrations are correlated with airborne
particulate matter (PM) concentrations () and that airborne PM can carry
microorganisms (). PD catheters represent a potential channel that allows pathogens to enter
the peritoneal cavity from the atmosphere. When the PD catheters and dialysate bags are
connected and/or disconnected, or the exit site is cleaned, the risk of infection with
airborne microorganisms increases. Thus, PD patients performing exchanges in areas with
high levels of environmental PM2.5 (PM2.5 relates to airborne droplets or particles with a
diameter of <2.5 µm) experienced a higher rate of infection from PD within 12 months
than those performing exchanges in areas with low exposure to environmental PM2.5 ().
This case report was written retrospectively. No interventional protocol was administered
to the patient concerned. Ethical approval from the author’s affiliated institution was
not required under the condition that confidentiality and anonymity of the patient were
maintained in the final report and analysis. The patient provided written consent for the
publication of his data.
There were three prioritized health problems in the present case: peritonitis and the
exit-site infection, imbalanced nutrition (insufficient intake of nutrients required to
meet the increased metabolic demands due to CAPD-associated peritonitis), and
psychosocial concerns (workplace hygiene and inability to change jobs).
For immediate nursing management of the present case, the PD effluent was drained by
the dialysis nurse after a dwell time of ∼2 h and carefully inspected before laboratory
tests were performed (cell counts, differential, gram stain, and cultures). Peritoneal
lavage was then performed as prescribed by the physician, with three rapid exchanges of
PD fluid bags to remove inflammatory cells and microorganisms from the peritoneal cavity
and to provide symptomatic relief ().
Empiric antibiotic therapy for PD-associated peritonitis was started as prescribed by
the physician as soon as a cloudy effluent was noted (which can indicate peritonitis),
without waiting for cell count and culture results from the laboratory. shows a list of
prescribed medications administered to the patient. Intraperitoneal administration of
antibiotics is preferred over intravenous (IV) or per os routes to reduce the chances of
treatment failure unless there is clinical evidence of systemic sepsis, in which case IV
antibiotics are administered (). An effluent cell analysis with a WBC > 100/µL
(3,157/µL in the present case) with at least 50% PMN cells (97% in the present case)
indicated that peritonitis was the most probable cause of the cloudy effluent. The
dialysis nurse recommended that heparin was also indicated in the present case; with
prescription, the addition of heparin at a dose of 500 IU in every 1 L of dialysate may
assist in preventing catheter occlusion by inhibiting fibrin formation ().
For the exit-site infection, the initial nursing management involved the collection of
a swab by the dialysis nurse for culture and sensitivity tests. The swab was taken at
the first instance of exit-site inspection on admission. An appropriate antimicrobial
therapy was then administered as prescribed. Antimicrobial therapy should cover both
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (including Staphylococcus
aureus which tends to cause relatively poor clinical outcomes such as the
need for PD-catheter removal) (; ). Because this patient had a history of P.
aeruginosa infection, an antibiotic covering this microorganism was
recommended by the dialysis nurse. In the present case, 0.1% gentamicin cream was
prescribed by the physician, as purulence, tenderness, and edema were absent at the exit
site. Once culture results were available, therapy was modified based on the specific
sensitivity patterns. In the present case, since gentamicin cream was effective against
P. aeruginosa, it was continued as the drug of choice as recommended
by the dialysis nurse.
The frequency of exit-site care with 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate also needed to be
increased (). The clinical response was reviewed by the dialysis nurse after the
initiation of antibiotic treatment, and clinical improvement was expected during the
first 72 h. Once the culture and sensitivity results were known, the antibiotic therapy
was appropriately adjusted by the physician, and continuous treatment was provided by
the dialysis nurse. In the present case, the bacterial culture of the PD effluent
revealed Streptococcus mitis that was sensitive to penicillin G.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

5357,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-7160728-1,Extracted,"A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our outpatient clinic for medical workup of a severe form of postprandial hypoglycaemia. Seven years earlier, a Roux-Y gastric bypass was performed due to morbid obesity (preoperative BMI 44.7 kg/m2and weight 129 kg). Within two years, the patient lost 57 kg (BMI 25.5 kg/m2). A year later, the patient noticed, for the first time, hypoglycaemic episodes 1-2 hours after meal intake, which were mainly characterized by loss of concentration, severe fatigue, and auditory and visual impairment that quickly resolved after intake of carbohydrates. An oral glucose tolerance test, at that time, confirmed the presence of symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia (2.9 mmol/l). Symptoms persisted despite dietary modifications of up to twelve small meals, each containing a maximum of 20 g of carbohydrates. Off-label treatment with acarbose, saxagliptin, and metformin by her treating physician reduced the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes but did not significantly improve the situation. Eventually, the patient was referred to our hospital. Her remaining personal history included a mild form of orthostatic dysregulation, migraine, and a multilocular nodular hepatic hyperplasia that required a left-sided hemihepatectomy 17 years ago. The clinical examination was unremarkable apart from irritation-free scars after hemihepatectomy (height, 168 cm; weight, 72 kg; BMI, 25.5 kg/m2; blood pressure, 127/67 mmHg; regular heartbeat, 80 bpm). Laboratory analysis including blood smear; biochemistry comprising electrolytes and kidney and liver parameters; glycated haemoglobin; blood lipids; iron; vitamins B1, B6, B12, and D; and zinc were within reference ranges. A continuous glucose flash monitoring system confirmed a typical pattern of postbariatric hypoglycaemia without any signs of fasting or nocturnal hypoglycaemia. A mixed-meal test (300 ml Ensure plus®) containing 60 g of carbohydrates after a 10-hour fasting period confirmed symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia (sweating, drowsiness, odd behaviour, and incoordination) at a glucose level of 2.5 mmol/l, and intravenous glucose administration was required for immediate remission of symptoms (). Due to the severe symptomatic presentation of the patient, a 68Ga-DOTA-Exendin-4 PET/CT was performed to exclude an atypical presentation of an insulinoma or focal nesidioblastosis, which might be a surgical target [–]. Therein, the pancreas showed a homogeneous signal distribution (SUV 5.7–8.3), but intensive uptake in the first and second part of the duodenum (SUVmax of 10.0) was observed (). To further differentiate this unexpectedly strong tracer accumulation, a double-balloon enteroscopy was performed, which revealed macroscopically unremarkable intraluminal structures in the duodenum.

Abdominal X-ray revealed a normal bowel gas pattern without signs of obstruction.
Abdominal duplex and computed tomography abdominal angiography were performed (Figures -).
The mesenteric vascular duplex revealed patency of the abdominal aorta with a peak velocity of 152 cm/second (Figure ), whereas examination of the celiac trunk demonstrated severe grade stenosis with a pre-stenotic velocity of 152 cm/second and a remarkably high post-stenotic velocity of 520 cm/second (Figure ). The pre-stenosis velocity to post-stenosis velocity ratio was greater than 3:1. Interestingly, the peak velocity did not vary significantly with respiration, which may have indicated chronic fibrotic changes in the wall of the celiac artery secondary to compression over time. Subsequently, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography of the abdomen revealed acute angle J-configuration of the takeoff of the celiac axis, with stenosis (red arrow) at its origin and focal post-stenotic dilatation (Figure ). Thus, the diagnosis of celiac artery compression syndrome was made. The patient is currently pending evaluation for surgical division of the median arcuate ligament in order to decompress the stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [90.0, 'lbs']}",80.823,76.782,84.864,"The patient's weight is 90.0 lbs so this converts to 90.0 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 40.823 kg.

857,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-4217304-1,Extracted,"An 87 year old man with longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation and elevated stroke risk (CHADSVASC score = 3, HASBLED = 2) was felt not to be candidate for chronic oral anticoagulation due to repeated falls associated with orthopedic injury. He was referred to our Electrophysiology Laboratory for percutaneous suture ligation of the left atrial appendage.
A pre-operative CT angiogram was performed to determine the patient's left atrial appendage anatomy. This showed a single lobed appendage 3.3cm in length with a trabeculated distal portion and was deemed suitable for the exclusion procedure. Under general anesthesia, intra-operative 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated no left atrial thrombus. A Tuohy needle was used to enter the pericardial space via a subxiphoid approach under fluoroscopic guidance. Entry into the pericardial space was anterior-lateral, using contrast and a lateral fluoroscopic view. The access site was sequentially dilated and a 13Fr sheath was placed into the pericardial space. Next, trans-septal puncture was performed using an 8.5 Fr SL-1 sheath and an Extra Sharp Brokenbrough needle, via the right femoral vein. A Heparin drip was initiated to maintain adequate activated clotting time (250-300 sec).
A left atrial angiogram with an occlusive balloon (SentreHeart Endocath) confirmed the LAA size, shape and orientation, consistent with CTA findings. A magnet-tipped guidewire (Sentreheart FindrWIRZ) wire was advanced into the distal portion of left atrial appendage. A second magnet-tipped guidewire was advanced into the subxiphoid space and coupled magnetically to the LAA wire, in the end-to-end configuration. The Lariat suture loop was then advanced into the pericardial space over the magnet guidewire. The suture loop could not be advanced to the base of the appendage due to separation of the guidewire magnets. After manipulation of the suture loop the magnets were often noted to be in the end-to-side configuration, preventing successful positioning of the suture loop.
During manipulation of the magnet-tipped guidewires, the patient became hypotensive to a systolic pressure of 55 mmHg and a new pericardial effusion was noticed on TEE (). Approximately 200cc of blood was drained from the side arm of the epicardial sheath with some initial improvement in hemodynamics. The effusion reaccumulated and the blood pressure dropped. A pigtail catheter was emergently placed in the pericardial space. A total of 800cc was drained and autotransfused back to the patient. The patient's hemodynamic condition stabilized and the decision was made to continue the case. Hemostasis of the LAA would likely be achieved with successful application of the closure device.
With the pigtail catheter in place, a second subxiphoid epicardial access was obtained, directed more laterally from the first. The epicardial needle was directed towards the magnet tipped wire already in the LAA. The new orientation of the epicardial sheath was felt to improve access to the left atrial appendage.
The Lariat was advanced into the subxiphoid space through a second 13Fr sheath and easily tracked over the guidewire around the base of left atrial appendage. Appropriate position of the suture was confirmed with balloon inflation, atrial angiography, and color Doppler and 3D TEE ().
The suture loop was successfully deployed and there was no further accumulation of the effusion. Intra-op TEE showed no residual flow in the appendage. The pigtail catheter was left in place. Protamine was administered to partially reverse anticoagulation.
Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography 12 hours later showed no pericardial effusion and the pigtail catheter was removed. The patient was later discharged home.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [87, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': False, 'Stroke': False, 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': False, 'Thromboembolism history': False, 'Diabetes history': False}",2,2,2,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.

He has been using different doses and types of insulin since that diagnosis. However, his glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and insulin antibodies were negative (below detectable range). Therefore, this patient has features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, because of his clinical picture, this patient may have non-autoimmune fulminant type 1 diabetes, which is rare in Caucasian populations but comprises approximately 10% of type 1 diabetes cases in Japan []. His endogenous insulin secretory capacity was almost completely lost, since his post-meal C-peptide levels were repeatedly undetectable (below 0.1 ng/ml). His post-meal glucagon level was 107 pg/ml (normal range, 23 to 197 pg/ml). His BMI was 17.5 (body weight/body height = 52 kg/172 cm). His HbA1c level was above 8% in the three months prior to this study. Sitagliptin (50 mg/day) was added to the therapeutic regimen to try to achieve better control of his diabetes. At that time, he was using premixed biphasic insulin aspart (30% insulin aspart and 70% protamine-complexed insulin aspart; Novorapid 30 MIX) three times daily before each meal (15U, 7U and 16U, respectively). He was also taking 625 mg metformin three times daily and 75 mg miglitol three times daily. His post-meal blood glucose level was 242 mg/dl, and his HbA1c level was 8.1% at baseline. In the first month after starting sitagliptin, he had occasional mild hypoglycemia, which he could manage by taking glucose drinks by himself. He had no hypoglycemic events after the second month of sitagliptin therapy. His HbA1c level was followed for 24 weeks and was reduced from 8.1% to 7.1% (1.0% reduction, Figure ). His post-meal C-peptide levels repeatedly remained undetectable (below 0.1 ng/ml) after the start of sitagliptin treatment. No adverse events were observed in kidney or liver function. No weight gain or gastrointestinal complaints were noted. At eight weeks, he could reduce the insulin dose by 2U before each meal. The doses of other drugs remained unchanged.

Since 15 June 2020 (4 days before hospital admission), the patient was found to have COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tested at icddr,b. The patient was receiving medicine after being positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to the COVID-19 treatment protocol practiced in icddr,b. His medication included oral Paracetamol, Ivermectin 12 mg once, Doxycycline, Famotidine, Zinc, Vitamin C, and D. The patient was admitted on 19 June 2020 with complaints of fever for 11 days, the highest recorded temperature was 39.4 °C (102.92°F), associated with no chills and rigors and headache for 2 days. The patient also complained of generalized body-ache for the last 2 days and vomited fresh blood for an episode, at home, on the morning of hospital admission. On admission, the patient's weight was 85 kg (187.39 lbs.) and BMI was 31.2 kg/m2. The patient is a non-smoker, non-alcoholic, and had no co-morbidities.
On admission his temperature was 38.6 °C (101.48°F), pulse was 76 beats/minute and blood pressures were 110/79 mm of Hg. Though breathing effort (respiratory rate 24/minute) was mildly increased, the patient was well-maintaining oxygen saturation in room air (SpO2 was 99% in room air) (). The patient presented with no sign of dehydration. Systematic examinations did not show any abnormal findings.
Differential Diagnosis: We set out our differential diagnosis based on the presentation of the case, including COVID-19 with stress ulcer or either Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) or Dengue. We conducted relevant laboratory investigations later to reach the final diagnosis, however, the unavailability of upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy remained one of our limitations in excluding any possibility of GI ulcer. Furthermore, we were unable to rule out COVID-19-related frailty, which could have increased the patient's morbidity, as discussed by Van Schaik Sharon and DeWitte, who compared it to the historical context of the Black Death pandemic in the 14th century [].

She had a 45 pound weight loss within six months. She denied any other symptoms suggestive of local or systemic infections, recent travels or sick contacts, changes in her diet habit, or medications within the last year.
Vital signs were within normal range. Physical exam revealed generalized abdominal tenderness with guarding and signs of dehydration. At the emergency department, the patient suffered from a cardiac arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and admitted to the intensive care unit.

CT scan of the abdomen showed ascending colon inflammation and evidence suggestive of perforation (Figures and ). She was treated conservatively without surgical intervention. A repeat abdominal CT scan revealed improving of the colonic inflammation and sealing of the perforation.
An extensive investigation for chronic diarrhea over the past year was performed, including serum thyroid stimulating hormone and stool cultures, Clostridium difficile toxin assay, ova, parasites, osmolality, and electrolytes that were unremarkable. Celiac disease was excluded by negative conventional serology tests (tissue transglutaminase antibodies, endomysial antibodies and antienterocyte antibodies) and the absence of a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Management including an opioid-receptor agonist, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and antibiotic therapy failed to relieve her symptoms.

At that time, the surgical specimen was confirmed to be HCC, Edmondson grade II. After 14 months, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lung metastases and left adrenal gland metastasis. The level of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA II) was elevated abnormally (207 mAU/ml). Diagnosed with recurrent HCC with multiple lung metastases and adrenal metastasis, the patient received palliative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and carboplatin. Following two cycles of first-line chemotherapy, the disease progressed. The patient was administered two more cycles of second-line chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and carboplatin, and three cycles of third-line chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. However, the disease demonstrated no objective response and further progressed. The patient and physician agreed to discontinue cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the patient was transferred to Dankook University Hospital for paliative care on February 19, 2009.

Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L."

The patient was scheduled to undergo anesthesia for placement of a central venous catheter for her upcoming stem cell transplantation. The patient presented with hearing deficits, visual abnormalities, cognitive delays, small stature, chronic malnutrition, and unsteady gait. Given her complicated disease process, the decision was made to admit the patient to the hospital that evening in anticipation for surgery the following morning. In an effort to maintain adequate hydration and oxygenation during the preoperative fast, an intravenous saline solution with 5% dextrose was administered as a continuous infusion overnight.
The patient weighed 17 kg and was 109 cm tall. Her previous surgical history included a right cochlear implant four years priorly and no anesthetic complications at that time. Preoperatively, the patient was awake, cachectic, and frail. She was accompanied by her father, sitting up in bed, and spontaneously breathing room air. Her vital signs included tachycardia of 124 beats per minute, her airway exam was normal, and her laboratory examination showed slight hypoalbuminemia of 3 g/dL and low total protein of 5.4 g/dL. The anesthesia plan was to intubate the patient as the patient had GI dysmotility and abdominal pain.
Upon arrival to the operating room suite, monitors were placed, preoxygenation was provided, and general anesthesia was induced. The induction agents of choice included 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam, 3 mcg/kg of fentanyl, and 1 mg/kg of ketamine. Continuous infusions of 0.7 mcg/kg/min of dexmedetomidine and 15 mcg/kg/min of ketamine were also initiated at the start of induction and maintained throughout the case. After adequate depth of anesthesia was established, the patient was easily intubated with a 5.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube following topical laryngotracheal anesthesia with an LTA using 1 cc of 4% lidocaine. The use of volatile anesthetic agents, muscle relaxants, and propofol was omitted in the care of this patient. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Once a left subclavian triple lumen catheter was placed, the dexmedetomidine and ketamine infusions were both discontinued. Spontaneous ventilation was established; the patient was extubated shortly thereafter and transported to the postoperative recovery unit.
Throughout this patient's hospital stay, our anesthetic team had the privilege of caring for this patient on two other occasions and the same anesthetic plan was utilized. The other two procedures included a repeated central line venous insertion and a liver biopsy. The liver biopsy was performed after she developed abnormal liver function tests (increased AST, ALT, alkaline phosphate, and bilirubin) following her stem cell transplant from a matched unrelated donor. Due to the patient's young age and the anticipated discomfort of the procedure, the decision was made to anesthetize the patient for the liver biopsy. After each of these anesthetics, the patient was closely monitored and no apparent postoperative complications were reported.",What is the patient's body surface area?

The patient had no noteworthy family medical history or genetic information. She had no yellowing of the conjunctiva bulbi; no conjunctival anemia; no cervical, thoracic, or abdominal abnormalities; and no edema on the anterior tibia. Considering that the patient was somewhat ectomorphic and tended to experience worsening of symptoms during menstruation, tokishakuyakusan extract granules (5.0 g/day), which are effective for treating cold sensitivity and headaches, were prescribed (). After taking tokishakuyakusan extract granules, symptoms including cold sensitivity, tinnitus, dizziness, and headache were alleviated; however, her menstrual cycle had remained irregular. Three years after the initiation of the Kampo treatment she had no menstruation for more than 2 months, so Kampo treatment was started anew for the irregular menstruation.
Subjective symptoms included cold sensitivity of the lower body, tinnitus, and lower back pain, in addition to irregular menstruation; thus, the prescription was changed from tokishakuyakusan extract granules to HJG extract granules (5.0 g/day). Two months later, she reported no menstruation despite continuous administration of HJG extract granules.
The patient's chief complaint was irregular menstruation with subjective symptoms including cold sensitivity of the lower body and lower back pain. In addition, she was somewhat thin and had weakness of the lower abdominal region. Thus, treatment with HJG was expected to be effective for this patient, and as a result, treatment was changed to HJG pills (40 pills/day) instead of simply increasing the dose of HJG extract granules.
One month after the administration of HJG pills, the patient had menstruation for 5 days. She continued taking the medication and menstruated again, but her cycle was abnormally long at around 40 days. Hence, the dose of HJG pills was increased from 40 to 60 pills/day. Since then, her menstrual cycle has become ~30 days.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [155.0, 'cm']}",47.855,45.462,50.248,"The patient's gender is Female.

She underwent palliation in 1962 (age 12) with a classic right-sided BTT shunt and TOF repair in 1967 (age 17) with closure of the VSD, relief of the RV outflow tract obstruction, and closure of the BTT shunt. Over the course of the years, she developed atrial fibrillation for which she was started on oral anticoagulation. In 1993, she had a first episode of massive haemoptysis which was treated conservatively. In 2002, computed tomography (CT) indicated a stellate nodule in the right upper lung lobe. Over the next years the lesion remained stable on axial follow-up imaging. In 2019, after new episodes of haemoptysis, this time with progressively worsening dyspnoea, a positron emission tomography–CT was performed showing isotope accumulation in the lesion of the right upper lung lobe (). She underwent a bronchoscopy that showed mucosal swelling in the right upper lobe. Cytology indicated acute inflammation without evidence of malignancy.
On physical examination, the right-sided radial pulse was absent and blood pressure (BP) not measurable. Blood pressure and heart rate taken on the left arm were 112/45 mmHg and 78 b.p.m., respectively. Respiratory rate was 22 per minute. The second heart sound was pronounced with a grade 3/6 systolic and 2/4 diastolic murmur at the second intercostal space on the left. C-reactive protein was normal (2.9 mg/L) and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide slightly elevated (733 ng/L). The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with inferolateral ST depression and Q-waves in V1–V2–aVR (). Transthoracic echocardiography indicated a moderately dilated RV with normal systolic function, a peak/mean gradient of 53/32 mmHg across the pulmonary valve with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation ().
A diagnostic cardiac catheterization was performed but no arteriovenous connections were seen and the BTT shunt was not patent. Right atrial pressure was 14 mmHg, RV systolic pressure 56 mmHg, systolic pulmonary artery pressure 33 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure 21 mmHg. The RV was dilated with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. A bronchoscopy with EndoBronchial UltraSound (EBUS) in order to perform EBUS guided biopsy was performed. A rope-like structure was seen through the bronchoscope, but we were unable to take a biopsy ().
After multidisciplinary discussion, the findings appeared to be most consistent with chronic inflammation due to a foreign body with secondary chronic inflammation, rather than vasculitis or a granulomatous infection, and the patient underwent a thoracotomy with lobectomy of the superior lobe of the right lung. The foreign body was removed without any resistance nor bleeding. Pathology indicated diffuse necrotizing granulomatous inflammation around the rope-like structure ( and ) which appeared to be the old suture around the BTT shunt that had caused a chronic inflammatory reaction invading the right upper bronchus and causing haemoptysis. The patient remained stable after the procedure. She left the hospital after a couple of days. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. After 3 months, she underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement.

Home medications included atorvastatin, clomiphene, insulin Humalog 16 units subcutaneous before meal and bedtime, canagliflozin, Levemir, 54 units subcutaneous daily, lisinopril, and metformin. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl on routine laboratory testing prior to admission. He had no family history of kidney disease. He did not use tobacco or illicit drugs.
In the emergency department (ED), the patient was afebrile, oral temperature 97.6, blood pressure 105 mmHg systolic and 58 mmHg diastolic, tachycardic heart rate (HR) 128, tachypneic respiratory rate (RR) 28, blood glucose level 559 mg/dL, arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH arterial 7.11, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) arterial 16, PCO2 total arterial 6, HCO3 arterial 5.1, PCO2 arterial 66. Arterial blood gas findings in the setting of hyperglycemia were consistent with DKA. Findings were further confirmed by positive ketonuria on urinalysis (UA). He was also found to have lactic acid level of 4.2 mmol/L in the setting of regular metformin use at home.
Initial blood and urinary examination are shown in Table . Renal function was abnormal (blood creatinine 2.96 mg/dL) and hematuria and proteinuria were detected. Complete metabolic panel also revealed serum sodium 124 mmol/L, potassium 7 mmol/L, bicarbonate 8 mmol/L, glucose 525 mg/dL, elevated anion gap of 31. Inflammatory markers were elevated (lactate dehydrogenase level 501 IU/L, C reactive protein 32.7 mg/L, ferritin level 2951 ng/mL, and procalcitonin level 4.31 mg/ml). The chest X-ray showed mild patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities. Patient was tested for COVID-19 and he tested positive.
Clinical course
In the ED, the patient was hypoxic O2 saturation 85% on room air. The patient was started on nasal cannula oxygen with minimal improvement in saturation after which he was put on 15 L of high flow nasal cannula oxygen without any improvement in O2 saturation. Then the patient was given etomidate 20 mg IV, succinylcholine 150 mg IV and was intubated and put on ventilator support. The patient was then admitted to intensive care unit. The patient was found hypotensive 90/52 mmHg after intubation and was started on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. The patient was given 10 units of insulin as bolus with maintenance insulin drip. He was also administered azithromycin 500 mg IV and ceftriaxone 1 g IV and was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Nephrology was consulted due to worsening kidney function, hyperkalemia, and decreased urine output. The patient was started on continuous renal replacement (CRRT) on hospital day two, about 27 hrs after admission. CRRT was provided as continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration using a Prismaflex CRRT machine (Baxter Inc, Deerfield, IL). The prescribed dose is 25 ml/kg/h. We used titratable anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin after CRRT was started. After a week on CRRT the patient continues to have hypoxia requiring prone positioning and mechanical ventilation. The patient was given convalescent plasma on hospital day six as an experimental treatment due to worsening respiratory status and multiorgan failure. On day nine, the patient continues to have minimal urine output, he was transfused convalescent plasma again, no remdesivir or tocilizumab was given during the hospitalization. The patient received dexamethasone since hospital day six for total eight days. The patient also had a thromboembolic event, he was found to have acute thrombosis of left common femoral vein, femoral and popliteal vein on hospital day 33, he remained on IV heparin which was later transitioned to coumadin.
On hospital day 19, the patient remained intubated, off pressor, CRRT was discontinued, serum creatinine was 3.44 mg/dL on CRRT that increased to 5.23 mg/dL the next day. On hospital day 20, he was started on hemodialysis. He was continued on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule. Patient underwent tracheostomy on day 24. The patient was weaned off ventilator on day 30 and placed on trach collar. Prior to day 42 the patient remained oliguric. The patient since then started to make good urine output gradually >30 cc/hr and received last hemodialysis on day 45. On day 48, serum creatinine level improved to 1.30 mg/dL after he stopped dialysis since hospital day 45 (Table ).

The concentration of sodium is 124.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 124.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 124.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 124.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 124.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 124.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 559.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 124.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (559.0 - 100) = 135.016 mEq/L.

The patient was the first child of unrelated Turkish parents. She was born at term after an uneventful gestational delivery. She also had no history of repeated infections, cardiac anomalies, or seizures. A physical examination demonstrated a weight and head circumference of 6 kg (3rd percentile) and 40 cm (3rd percentile), respectively, and her height was 68 cm (50th percentile). She showed atypical facial features, hypertelorism, short philtrum, micrognathia, low set ears, fish-like mouth, and a wide nasal bridge. A neurological examination revealed hypotonia, with no movement in the bilateral lower limbs, and a surgical scar was found surrounding the region of the repaired myelomeningocele. Her cardiac examination was normal. Laboratory investigations including a thyroid function test, parathyroid hormone levels, and other routine hematology and biochemical parameters were within normal limits. In the chest X-ray, the thymus could not be identified. The echocardiogram was unremarkable. There were no renal anomalies on clinical or ultrasound examinations. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets revealed a mild T-cell deficiency with CD3 (28%), CD4 (21.5%), CD8 (10.5%), CD 19 (38%), and normal levels of immunoglobulins. Her mother’s facial features appeared mildly dysmorphic. She had mild mental retardation with learning disabilities, a nasal voice, and hypothyroidism. She had no history of seizures or repeated infections. Her serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels and echocardiography were normal. In view of the facial dysmorphism in both the patient and her mother and the presence of a T-cell deficiency, we suspected DGS. Both the patient’s and mother’s chromosomal examinations with fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion. On the basis of these results, we accepted the diagnosis of DGS. At the age of 1 year, the patient experienced a clonic seizure while calcium concentration was normal. An electroencephalogram and brain magnetic resonance imaging were within normal limits. The seizure repeated a second time after 1 month while serum calcium concentrations were normal limits.

She had a blood pressure of 130/80-mmHg and pulse rate of 64 per minute without any cyanosis. She had symmetric thoracoabdominal breathing. Abdominal examination revealed no distension, no rebound, no ascites, no hepatosplenomegaly and normoactive bowel sounds. The complete blood cell count was in normal limits except decreased lymphocytes cells (lymphocyte = 250/mm3), and the biochemical analysis of the blood for hepatic and renal function, urine analysis and fecal occult blood test were all within normal limits only lower albumin (albumin = 2.1 g/dl) level was observed. The tumor markers for CEA and CA 19-9, celiac markers and autoimmune indicators were also normal. Upper endoscopy revealed erythematous antral gastritis. No lesions were observed on the colonoscopy and the abdominal ultrasound. No pathology was detected in echocardiography.
Ultrasonography (USG) revealed multiple anechoic cystic nodularities in the intestinal wall protruding into the fluid-filled lumen (Fig. ). Because of any diagnose could be done by ultrasound, abdominal computerized tomography (CT) has decided to withdraw.
CT showed increased wall thickness on 40 cm segment of ileum. Capsule endoscopy was performed and a polypoid infiltrating area was found ~40–50 cm segment of middle and distal jejenum (Fig. A and B). Bone marrow biopsy was performed for suspicious lymphoproliferative disease. Biopsy result showed normocellular bone marrow. Flow cytometry of bone marrow mononuclear cells with the work done by immunophenotyping detected no significant antigenic exploration. It was decided to take a PET-CT for to clarify a suspicious tumor or paraneoplastic syndrome in patient. PET-CT showed diffuse wall thickness increase in the ileum. These results are in line with the assessment of the causes of protein-losing enteropathy; lymphangiectasia, intestinal lymphoma and tuberculosis. After all, surgical decision was taken with these presumptive diagnoses.
Operation started with diagnostic laparoscopic approach but nothing specific has been detected in small intestine and its meso. Then it was decided to go laparotomy. Terminal ileum was seen normal but swollen intestinal wall and pathological lymph node in the mesentery of 35–40 cm to the proximal terminal ileum were found. Excised lymph node was sent to pathology for frozen observation. Pathology result showed as lymphorrhagia. Patient was perop consulted with gastroenterology clinic and resection of the affected part of ileum decision was taken. Segmental resection including affected bowel loops were made and functional end-to-end anastomosis performed. Specimen was sent to pathology. Bowel movements are normal, and gas outlet with defecation was observed postoperatively third day. Then oral feeding was allowed on the post-op fourth day. Patient was discharged sixth day postoperatively. No further therapy was needed because of the benign manner of the lesions.
Microscopic examination of the resected specimens revealed expanded cystic vascular lesions partly extending to the intestinal mucosa in small bowel mesentery and subserosa (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically the endothelial cells, lining the vascular structures, were reactive with D2-40, CD31 and ERG whereas negative with CD34 (Fig. ).

replacement solution (Prismasol 4®) 500mL/hr, post-filter
replacement solution (Prismasol 4®) 500mL/hr and fluid removal
50mL/hr. During the first two days of therapy, the main problem with
hemodiafiltration was easy coagulability of the hemofilter due to high levels of
myoglobin in circulation. To overcome this problem, higher pre-dilution flow rates
were used (maximum 1500mL/h). After 48 hours, she had asymptomatic hypophosphatemia
of 2.7mg/dL that was corrected after adding phosphorous to the replacement
solutions. On day 5, intermittent hemodialysis was started, and three sessions on
alternate days were performed. A calcium antagonist was prescribed on day six due to
worsening hypertension.
Signs and symptoms were controlled with medical treatment and renal replacement
therapy. Creatinine kinase and myoglobin returned to normal values in two weeks. Her
diuresis started to recover after the second day of therapy. At discharge, her renal
function was recovering, and she had a glomerular filtration rate of
88.9mL/min/1.73m2.
Regarding the investigation of the underlying insult, an acylcarnitine analysis by
tandem mass spectrometry of the patient's dried blood spot revealed a deficiency of
very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD). A genetic study revealed the
following mutations in compound heterozygosity of the VLCAD gene: p.P65Tfs*7 (c.
187_192insA) and p.R336H (c.1097G > A).
Frequent meals with carbohydrate-rich intake before exercise and restriction of

No prior history of these symptoms was reported. The patient did not regularly see a physician. Upon admission, the vitals were BP −196/108 mm Hg, HR −89/min, RR −20/min, SpO2 −98% on room air, and a weight of 351 lbs (BMI 64 kg/m2). On fundoscopic examination, he had papilledema, but his vision was grossly normal. Cardiovascular examination revealed no murmurs and 1-2+ edema in lower extremities. His central nervous system examination revealed a 6th nerve palsy on the left, dysconjugate gaze, facial symmetry, and midline tongue. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. There was no personal or family history of sickle cell anemia.
Laboratory data are shown in Table . Urinalysis was suggestive of protein >300 without any evidence of infection or blood. CT scan of the head was suggestive of partially empty sella turcica and no evidence of acute intracranial process. The patient's blood pressure improved shortly after admission. He underwent lumbar puncture (LP) which was suggestive of pseudotumor cerebri, and treatment with acetazolamide was initiated. Nephrology was consulted for an incidental finding of acute kidney injury (AKI) and proteinuria. The patient's kidney function was within normal limits based on the laboratories obtained from outside hospital during an ER visit 1 week prior to the current admission. He was diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) and was prescribed Bactrim (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole)-DS (double strength), one tablet twice a day for a week. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain the results of urinalysis or any other clinical details of his ER visit, and there were no prior laboratories on our system to assess for baseline urine proteinuria. The only information we had was, he was prescribed antibiotics for UTI and the kidney functions were essentially in the normal range. The patient's history was negative for any risk factors for AKI or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Peripheral smear did not reveal any schistocytes. The spot urine protein: 369, urine creatinine: 93 (protein/creatinine ratio = 4 gm/gm). Urine microscopy did not reveal red blood cell (RBC) casts or dysmorphic RBCs. HIV antigen/antibody was negative, and the viral load was <40. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was 1:40 speckled. Anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, and anti-dsDNA were negative. The complements C3 was within normal limits and C4 was elevated. Evaluation for infectious causes including Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Parvovirus, and Hepatitis virus was all negative. C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were elevated at 3.243 mg/dL and 120 mm/hr respectively. Renal ultrasound revealed a 15.4 cm right kidney and 15.2 cm left kidney with increased echogenicity bilaterally without any evidence of cortical thinning or suspicious cysts, masses, or hydronephrosis. Except for the recent exposure to Bactrim, the patient was not on any other medication that could explain the cause of his AKI. Given the presentation of AKI, nephrotic range proteinuria, and negative serologic workup, a renal biopsy was obtained as shown in the image. (Figure ). Light microscopy showed up to four glomeruli with no globally sclerotic glomeruli were identified per level. Three of the glomeruli show capillary tuft collapse with podocyte hypertrophy and numerous protein reabsorption droplets. No necrosis or crescent formation was identified. There was mild interstitial fibrosis. Many of the tubules showed dilatation with proteinaceous casts. There is a patchy, lymphoplasmacytic interstitial infiltrate. The vasculature is unremarkable. Immunofluorescence showed limited deposition of C3 within the glomeruli. Podocyte protein reabsorption droplets were seen, and ultrastructural evaluation revealed extensive podocyte foot process effacement. Electron microscopy showed hypertrophic podocytes with extensive podocyte foot process effacement without any definitive immune complex dense deposits. The glomerular basement membranes are irregularly thickened with an expansion of the lamina densa which is of unclear significance. There was no evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) on the biopsy.
Treatment involved administration of 120 mg of oral Prednisone every other day, and the patient was discharged without any evidence suggesting the need to initiate dialysis as he remained nonoliguric during the entire hospital stay. Hyponatremia was corrected at an appropriate rate. Subsequent nephrology clinic visits revealed improving renal indices. One week after the discharge, patient's laboratories revealed BUN of 55 mg/dL with a Cr of 4.52 mg/dL. Three months after discharge, his BUN was 17 mg/dL with a creatinine of 1.67 mg/dL at which point steroid taper was initiated.

The patient developed the above symptoms after eating greasy food 10 h ago; she vomited her stomach contents and bile repeatedly, but did not experience hematemesis. Fever occurred after the abdominal pain, and the highest body temperature was 38.8 °C. She did not present with chills, jaundice, constipation or diarrhea. Apart from these observations, the patient had a history of intermittent bloating after meals for at least 20 years, and she denied the symptoms of steatorrhea. The patient has had type 2 diabetes for 12 years, and metformin and glimepiride were used to control the DM; her fasting blood sugar level fluctuates from approximately 7–10 mmol/L. She also has congenital scoliosis. Her family medical history was unremarkable.
The patient’s body temperature was 38.9 °C, and her BMI was 32 kg/m2. The physical examination revealed mild abdominal muscle tension, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and positive Murphy’s sign. The hematological examinations showed a high white blood cell count (14.4*10^9 /L) and an elevated neutrophil percentage (87.7%). The blood biochemistry tests showed high blood sugar (12.1 mmol/L), low K+ (2.9 mmol/L) and low total cholesterol levels (6.2 mmol/L). The abdominal CT including coronal reconstruction and sagittal reconstruction image showed multiple stones in the gallbladder, and the gallbladder wall was rough and had mild edema (Fig. a). The body and tail of the patient’s pancreas were absent; in the area where the tail of the pancreas should be, we only observed blood vessels of the spleen (Fig. b-i). Since the patient had no evidence of bile duct stones, MRCP was not performed in the emergency department.
So the preoperative diagnosis is acute cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, agenesis of the dorsal pancreas, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency were not excluded. We gave the patient gastric decompression. Cefminox were used to control the infection, and magnesium sulfate was used as a cholagogue. In addition, to relieve her symptoms, we used anisodamine, metoclopramide and famotidine. Rehydration therapy and potassium supplementation were conducted simultaneously. After the patient recovered from the acute stage, she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy; 1.8 g pancreatin enteric-coated capsules were given per day continuously to relieve the symptoms of pancreatic exocrine function.

3353,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-8432418-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of abnormal accumulation at the distal metaphysis of the left radius on an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-position emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan taken for follow-up after renal cancer. The patient had a history of CKD due to microvascular nephrotic syndrome and diabetic nephropathy. The patient had undergone a unilateral partial nephrectomy for renal cancer three years before and had not experienced any recurrence or metastasis.
At the time of the initial examination, there was no obvious swelling or tenderness in the distal part of his left forearm and no restriction in the range of wrist motion. Laboratory data showed slightly low levels of various electrolytes in addition to renal dysfunction, consistent with the hemodialysis state, with no other noteworthy findings: Na 134mEq/L, K 3.2mEq/L, Cl 92mEq/L, Ca 7.4mg/dL, BUN 75.0mg/dL, Cr 10.01mg/dL.
A geographic radiolucent lesion with sclerotic margins was found in the radiographs taken at the initial consultation (Figure ). The tumor measured about 5 cm, and the bone cortex was thinned and expanded due to tumor growth. Computed tomography (CT) images showed no calcification inside the tumor, and the bone cortex appeared to be partially disrupted (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed homogeneous isointense signals in the T1-weighted images and heterogeneously mixed iso- and high-signals in the T2-weighted images (Figure ). The FDG-PET scan revealed high accumulation in the left distal radial metaphysis (Figure ).
One month after the initial visit, an incisional biopsy of the tumor was performed with the possibility of a low-grade malignancy based on the imaging findings. Tissue samples were collected by making a hole on the bone cortex just subjacent to the first compartment of the extensor tendon sheath. After the biopsy, the bone hole was filled with cement, the tendon sheath was repaired, and the procedure was completed. The collected samples were brownish (Figure ). The pathological findings of the tissue revealed numerous multinucleated giant cells and no atypical cells, leading to the diagnosis of GCTB (Figure ).
The patient was scheduled to undergo tumor curettage. Administration of denosumab may be a treatment option, but was not indicated because of the frequent hypocalcemia at different times caused by CKD. However, X-rays and CT images taken again before surgery showed osteogenic signs in the tumor (Figure ). Usually, GCTB do not show osteogenesis in their natural course. Therefore, it was necessary to reconsider the diagnosis of the biopsy specimen.
Reviewing the laboratory data, the intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was abnormally high (915.4 pg/mL) at the time of the initiation of peritoneal dialysis four months before the initial visit. Thereafter, the value of intact PTH decreased to within the normal range (20.0 pg/mL). These laboratory data are shown in Table . These data suggested a possible association between PTH and tumor behavior.
We decided to perform a re-biopsy instead of curettage in order to confirm the pathological diagnosis. The newly collected samples were white tissue with a light pinkish color (Figure ), differing from those of the previous biopsy. The pathological findings of re-biopsy specimens showed the almost complete disappearance of multinucleated giant cells and mature bone tissue, with no obvious neoplastic changes or malignant images (Figure ). The osteogenic changes and the disappearance of the giant cells indicated that the tumor was a BT. The patient was followed up by clinical images every six months. One year after the biopsy, the radiographic images showed further osteogenesis and the lesion was considered almost healed (Figure ).","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [52, 'years'], 'creatinine': [10.01, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",5.498,5.223,5.773,"The patient is 52 years old.

He had previous three myocardial infarctions with the last one occurring 14 years before this admission. At that time, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with LIMA to left anterior descending artery and two saphenous vein grafts to the right coronary and first obtuse marginal arteries. Following surgery, his chest pain resolved, but he had frequent admissions with chest pain over the last four years which was misdiagnosed as coronary artery spasm. In addition, his past medical history included congestive heart failure and cardiac arrest twelve years ago. His coronary risk factors were hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of ischaemic heart disease, and a 45 pack-year history of cigarette smoking.
His physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 124/63 mmHg in the right arm and 83/50 mmHg in the left, a regular pulse of 84 beats/minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. He had normal heart sounds and the lung fields were clear. The vascular examination revealed easily palpable right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremity pulses. Left upper extremity pulses were present but diminished. Carotid arteries were palpable with no audible bruits. No abdominal masses were palpated.
A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated ischaemic changes in lateral leads and a chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. Cardiac enzymes revealed troponin of 0.05 μg/L. On diagnostic coronary angiography, there was 50% stenosis in left main stem and 50% stenosis in left anterior descending artery in mid-segment with good run off. Failure to pass the catheter through the left subclavian artery indicated possible stenosis raising suspicion of CSSS.
CT Angiogram confirmed a 2 cm stenosis at the origin of left subclavian artery (). Stenting of left subclavian artery was considered hazardous due to the risk of occlusion of the adjacent vertebral artery. The patient was referred to undergo left common carotid to subclavian artery bypass. After exploration, the left subclavian artery was found to have significant atherosclerosis. Therefore, an infraclavicular incision was utilised for access to the left axillary artery. A 6 mm ringed Vascutek PTFE graft (Sulzer Vascutek Ltd.; Renfrewshire, Scotland, UK) was used to construct a bypass between the left common carotid artery and the left axillary artery tunnelled beneath the clavicle. Carotid shunt was not used while systemic heparin (5000 units) was administered during the operation. Postoperatively, a good graft pulse was felt in addition to easily palpable left upper extremity pulses. The patient made an uneventful recovery, the angina pain disappeared and he was discharged 4 days following the operation.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 146.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 106.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 146.0 mEq/L - (106.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 19.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 19.0 - 12 = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 7.0 mEq/L."

She was initially placed on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg twice daily with mild improvement of palpitations; however, she was still experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after deglutination. Metoprolol tartrate was subsequently discontinued, and she was started on flecainide 50 mg p.o. every 8 h and verapamil 40 mg p.o. every 8 h. During her hospitalization, there were no recorded episodes of ventricular tachycardia. After initiation of flecainide and verapamil, there has been no documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation and her symptoms of palpitations have resolved.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [109.0, 'lbs']}",89.442,84.97,93.914,"The patient's weight is 109.0 lbs so this converts to 109.0 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 49.442 kg. For patient's whose weight is greater than 20 kg, the formula for computing the maintenance fluid is 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 20 kilograms). Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (49.442 kg - 20 kg) = 89.442 mL/hr.

1,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-6477550-1,Extracted,"A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.
Upon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th–75th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th–75th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4–48 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.
A right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm ×2.2 cm×2.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()
Postoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [55.0, 'kg'], 'height': [162.8, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.57, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [16, 'years']}",141.042,133.99,148.094,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 16 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.57 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 162.8 cm, which is 162.8 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.628 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.628 m * 1.628 m) = 20.752 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.8, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 54.918 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 16) * 54.918 * 0.85) / (0.57 * 72) = 141.042 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 141.042 mL/min."
4039,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8159308-1,Extracted,"A 16-year-old female (169cm, 70kg, BMI 24.5) with TCS status post genial tubercle advancement, mandibular reconstruction with graft, and LeFort I osteotomy and craniotomy, presented for removal of left maxillary bone plate and screws and implantation of customized right and left malar implants. Patient’s previous anesthesia record revealed that she had adequate mask ventilation with an oral airway, chin and jaw lift and that she was intubated electively with a nasal fiberoptic scope and extubated in the operating room the following day. Patient’s exam revealed Mallampati IV, short thyromental distance (3cm), small chin, limited mouth opening (2cm), and large tongue relative to oral cavity (Figure ). General anesthesia with an elective asleep fiberoptic intubation was performed. After induction, mask ventilation was feasible with jaw and chin lift and the patient was intubated with 6.5 oral endotracheal tube with cuff via fiberoptic bronchoscope with one attempt.
The surgery was uneventful. During the operation, the patient received 100mcg of fentanyl at the induction and 0.5mg hydromorphone at the incision for pain control. Since incision, no more opioid was given to avoid the risk of respiratory depression at extubation. Prior to extubation, the surgeon inserted an orogastric tube to suction any bloody secretion to prevent the risk of aspiration. At the end of the 3.5-hour procedure, the neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate with a Train-of-Four of four twitches and no fade. The patient was breathing spontaneously, following simple commands and opening her eyes. The decision was made to extubate her in the operating room. Soon after extubation, silent chest movement was observed with no end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and oxygen saturation (SpO­2) deteriorated rapidly. An oral airway was inserted, and positive pressure bag-mask ventilation was initiated. The patient continued to have no ETCO2, then two nasal airways were inserted in the patient’s bilateral nostrils with chin lift, jaw lift by using a two-person ventilation technique, and 110mg of propofol was administered intravenously. At the same time, the emergent surgical airway was called to be ready in a case of an impossible re-intubation if laryngospasm persisted. Laryngospasm improved after propofol bolus as ETCO­­2 returned and SpO2 improved significantly to 100% within two minutes. The patient’s respiratory status eventually stabilized with oxygen saturation of 97%, breathing on her own with both oral and nasal airway adjuncts without jaw lift or chin lift support.
At the time patient was transferred to post-anesthesia recovery unit, she developed hypoxemia with oxygen saturation in the low 80s despite her good respiratory effort. The patient was awake, alert and sitting in bed. Non-rebreather mask with high flow supplemental oxygen was initiated. Physical exam revealed that her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. No pink frothy secretion was seen when the patient was asked to take deep breaths and cough. Bedside chest radiograph revealed bilateral pulmonary opacities and gastric distension (Figure ), leading to the diagnosis of NPPE in the setting of her negative cardiac history. The gastric distension was likely from insufflation of the stomach secondary to the attempted positive pressure ventilation via face mask. The patient then received diuretics and was admitted to the intensive care unit for airway monitoring and management of pulmonary edema. On post-operative day 1, the patient improved clinically. Repeat chest radiograph showed improved pulmonary opacities bilaterally with residual atelectasis and improved gastric distension (Figure ). The patient was discharged home the following day.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [169.0, 'cm']}",60.53,57.503,63.557,"The patient's gender is Female.

IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (66.535 (in inches) - 60) = 60.53 kg.

Her past medical history included systemic hypertension for ten years, type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
At the admission she was markedly dyspneic, pale and had a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute. The blood pressure was 125/95 mmHg. At pulmonary auscultation there was evidence of broncospasm without signs of congestion.
The lower left leg was warm but pulseless. The oxygen saturation was reduced at about 82-85% in room air. Examination of arterial blood gases revealed hypocapnic hypoxia (pO2 46 mmHg, pCO2 21 mmHg, pH 7.52) and the electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation and inverted T waves in the anterior leads (V1-V3).
The laboratory examinations showed significant leukocytosis (21300/mm3), increased blood glucose and serum creatinine levels (Cr. 2.4 mg/dL), with D-dimer levels moderately high (715 ng/ml).
Echocardiography imaging revealed right ventricular dilatation and elevated transtricuspid systolic gradient with indirect signs of high pulmonary hypertension. The whole-body CT showed a massive thrombus in the main right and left pulmonary artery, extended to lobar branches (). Moreover, the abdomen CT demonstrated the almost entirely occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery () and of the right renal artery, by a floating clot in the lumen, (), resulting in renal hypoperfusion and further worsening of its function (Cr. 3.9 mg/dL). An embolic occlusion of the left external iliac artery was also evident. The Echo Doppler of her lower legs didn’t reveal signs of deep vein thrombosis, showing instead the whole thrombotic occlusion of poplytea artery. There was no evidence of ischemic lesions at the CT scan of brain.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) excluded the presence of intracardiac thrombi but it revealed a significant interatrial septum’s aneurysm with long tunnel-type patent foramen ovale (PFO). The presence of other anatomic anomalies, frequently associated with patent foramen ovale [], such as Chiari’s Network or a prominent Eustachian Valve were also excluded. A saline contrast echocardiography confirmed the presence of PFO and demonstrated a right-to-left shunt during Valsalva maneuver ().
Because of the hemodynamic stability, the patient’s age and the absence of contraindications to thrombolisis, the woman was treated with i.v. tPA (10 mg bolus followed by 90 mg infusion over 2h) and i.v. heparin with progressive improvement of clinical conditions and dyspnea.
During the following days the kidney function gradually improves with a reduction of hematic creatinine from 3.9 to 1.3 mg/dL. A repeat CT one week later showed a partial resolution of pulmonary embolism and the reduction of renal, mesenteric and iliac thrombosis, while the left poplytea artery’s occlusion persisted.
Her anticoagulation work up showed no evidence of factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation, antiphospholipid antibody screening was negative and level of homocysteine was normal. Levels of protein C, S and antithrombin III were unreliable in the context of an acute thromboembolic event or during antithrombotic therapy. Other predisposing factors for venous thromboembolism as metastatic solid tumors or lymphoproliferative disorders were excluded.
The patient was discharged 8 days after admission and no recurrent embolic episode was observed. She has to keep on assuming life-long oral anticoagulant therapy. PFO closure was not performed because our patient required a life-long anticoagulation therapy; the presence of a long tunnel-type PFO may give rise to technical problems in realizing device implantation and finally there are no clear guidelines based on randomized trials for therapy if patent foramen ovale is present.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [79, 'years'], 'creatinine': [3.9, 'mg/dL']}",11.193,10.633,11.753,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

Emergency medical services were called. En-route to the emergency room, she was found pulseless and initial rhythm showed ventricular fibrillation. The patient received CPR for 45 minutes, direct current cardioversion counter shocks of 360 J each, total of 1080 J were implemented and multiple boluses of epinephrine, amiodarone, lidocaine, and magnesium were given to restore effective cardiac rhythm. After the third attempt of defibrillation she converted to sinus rhythm. She was then transferred to the ICU. Her initial arterial blood gas was suggestive of respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.14, Pco2 of 84, and Po2 of 98. She was intubated with pressure support mechanical ventilation with the following settings: FiO2 of 100 %, respiratory rate of 32, tidal volume of 400 mL, and positive end expiratory pressure of 5. Her vital signs after the event were as follows; blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, pulse was 110/min, and oxygen saturation was at 95% with the ventilation setting. Electrocardiogram after the event showed sinus tachycardia. Chest roentgenogram was suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Her troponin level was 0.18 ng/mL (normal range <0.04 ng/mL) followed by 0.44 ng/mL and 0.43 ng/mL. On examination the patient was minimally following command. Her breath sound was coarse bilaterally with no other remarkable physical examination findings.

Echocardiography of the heart showed ejection fraction of 50%-55% and motion wall abnormality of basal, mid anterior, and inferior wall suggestive of underlying MI, which was a new finding as compared to the old report. Cardiac catheterization could not be performed due to her critical condition. On second day of her hospitalization, she started became anuric (urine output <100ml/24 h) and her creatinine started rising up causing acute kidney injury (AKI). Her further laboratory works up during the hospital course are listed in the table (Table ). Her urinalysis showed no red blood cells, pyuria or bacteria, but did show some granular casts. A renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction, and her fractional sodium was found to be 4.5%.

The patient’s renal function did not improve with fluid loading as a part of resuscitation post CPR initially considering it to be prerenal cause or with stress dose furosemide (1 mg/kg) after the diagnosis of intrinsic AKI was made. However, her plasma creatinine rose to 5.71 mg/dL. She was started on hemodialysis. However, her kidneys continued to show minimal renal recovery and the patient was transferred to a long-term care facility.

The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L.

Complete blood cell counts were, hemoglobin, 6.9 g/dL; white blood cell count, 12,970/mm3; and platelet count, 384,000/mm3. Among the blood coagulation tests, prothrombin time, activated partial thrombin time, and international normalized ratio were 15.4 (reference range: 11.9–14.3) s, 31.1 (29.1–43.5) s, and 1.20, respectively. Biochemical laboratory analyses were performed and the results were as follows: sodium, 130.0 mmoL/L (135–145); potassium, 4.4 mmoL/L (3.3–5.1); chloride, 93 mmoL/L; serum osmolarity, 272 mOsm/L (276–300); aspartate aminotransferase, 17 U/L (15–50), and alanine aminotransferase, 6 U/L(5–45). Urinary blood and red blood cells were negative. Stool wet smear and culture were unremarkable but occult blood in stool was positive (432.5 ng/mL, 0–12.0).
Transfusion of packed red blood cells, octreotide and a proton pump inhibitor were promptly initiated after exclusion of surgical abdomen. Gastroduodenofibroscopy was performed to identify the cause of melena and hematemesis, which revealed linear ulcers and scattered submucosal hemorrhages in the prepyloric area of stomach, and large circular ulcers in the first and second portions of the duodenum. The duodenal ulcers were along the folds. The mucosal margin of the ulcers was distinct and easily friable (). Pathologic examination showed ulcer debris, gastritis, and active duodenitis (). Serologic test for H. pylori immunoglobulin G and M, and rapid urease test were negative. H. pylori was also not detected on pathologic examination using Giemsa stain (). Additionally, there was no evidence of vasculitis on pathologic examination (). Serum gastrin level was 28.5 pg/mL (13–115). After the results were reported, the mother recalled that a packet of ORS was reconstituted with a lesser amount of water (≈50 mL) than the instructed amount on the manual (200 mL) when the aggravation of abdominal pain and hematemesis occurred. The ORS reconstituted in 50 ml of water had higher osmolarity (992 msom/kg) and higher concentrations of sodium (176.5 mEq/L), potassium (81.8 mEq/L), glucose (9,451 mg/dL), and citrate (122.6 mEq/L) compared with the ORS reconstituted in 200 mL of water (). The abdominal pain was resolved promptly and melena disappeared in two days after treatment was initiated. The child was discharged with good general condition after eight days of hospital stay. He has been in good general condition during the last six months.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [36.8, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [133.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [22.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [12970.0, 'm^3']}",3,3,3,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 133.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 12970.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3."
458,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-5642814-1,Extracted,"A 71-year-old Chinese woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with a generalized body rash of one-day duration. The rash started one day after the patient reinitiated allopurinol treatment for the spontaneous onset of bilateral ankle pain associated with redness and swelling. The patient reported two days of intermittent fever ranging from 100.4 °F to 101.4 °F. She denied the history of recent travel, tick bite, pain in other joints, and myalgias. Past medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and recently diagnosed gout. She was recently diagnosed with gout and allopurinol therapy was initially started four weeks prior to her current presentation.
The patient revealed that she was hospitalized with a similar rash, high-grade fever, and upper abdominal pain two weeks previously. The patient took allopurinol for one week and stopped it after her ankle pain resolved. Physical examination revealed right upper quadrant tenderness, and palpation elicited Murphy's sign (associated with acute cholecystitis). Skin examination revealed a petechial, non-blanching rash on all extremities. A poorly defined, diffuse, and nonscaling erythematous maculopapular rash covered the trunk. The vital signs were—heart rate: 135 beats/min, respiratory rate: 25/min, and temperature: 102.9 °F. In the ED, she developed hypotension of 90/60 mmHg.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated nonspecific pericholecystic fluid and periportal edema. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a thickened gallbladder wall measuring 7 mm and the presence of pericholecystic fluid. There were no visible stones. No intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation was noted. The proximal common bile duct (CBD) measured 3.5 mm. The initial laboratory evaluation revealed white cell count (WBC): 2.3 x 103/µL (4-11 x 103/µL), platelet count: 158 x 103/µL (150-450 x 103/µL), lactate: 3.9 mEq/L (0.5-1.3 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 12 mg/dL (10-26 mg/dl), creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (0.6-1.3 mg/dL), total bilirubin: 2.2 mg/dL (0.2-1 mg/dl), direct bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dL (0 to 0.3 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 71 IU/L (7-40 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 56 IU/L (0-40 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 100 IU/L (70-230 IU/L) , and serum lipase: 45 IU/L (0-140 IU/L). Therein, the patient was diagnosed with acute AC.
Intravenous (IV) vancomycin (1500 mg), cefepime (2 gm), and methylprednisolone (60 mg) were administered in addition to aggressive fluid resuscitation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy and drain placement were accomplished without complications. Blood and urine cultures were persistently negative. Resolution of the rash occurred on Day 3 of hospitalization and, subsequently, the corticosteroid therapy was discontinued. On the fourth hospital day, laboratory data included WBC: 12.9 x 103/uL, platelets: 52 x 103/uL, total bilirubin: 2.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 1.5 mg/dL, lactate: 1.3 mEq/L, and creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL. On the fourth, fifth, and sixth hospital days, eosinophil percentages were 17%, 14.2%, and 9.5%, respectively. The European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) score was four, suggesting the possibility of the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Antimicrobial therapy was changed to IV ceftriaxone and IV metronidazole on the fourth day. The patient showed significant improvement in the rash and started tolerating oral feeding. She was discharged from the hospital on Day 8. At the time of discharge, the etiology of acute AC had not been determined with certainty. Allopurinol was not discontinued at the time of discharge.
Five days after hospital discharge, the patient developed left-sided ankle pain and again took one dose of 300 mg allopurinol. Within 24 hours, a diffuse erythematous rash all over her body recurred, and she returned to the emergency department. Examination revealed temperature: 103.7 °F, heart rate: 117 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 20/minute, and blood pressure: 161/61 mmHg. A morbilliform rash was present over the pubic symphysis. A petechial rash was noted on both legs (Figure ) as well as on the upper extremities (Figure ).
The oral mucosa was uninvolved. The left ankle was warm and tender to touch and a mild effusion was present. Laboratory data included WBC: 9.4 x 103 /uL (4-11x103/μL), eosinophil: 31% (1%-3%), neutrophils: 72.5% (57-67%), C-reactive protein: (CRP) 9.100 mg/dL (1-3 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 90 mm/hr (0-20mm/hr), lipase: 170 U/L (0-140 U/L), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP): 177 pg/mL (0-100pg/mL), and uric acid: 5.9 mg/dL (2.1-6.3 mg/dl). Radiographic imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal any abnormalities. The diagnosis of ""possible"" DRESS syndrome due to allopurinol hypersensitivity was made on a RegiSCAR score of three. Intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg) was administered twice daily for six to seven days. Significant resolution of the rash occurred during treatment. The upper left arm was almost cleared of the rash (Figure ). Residual post-inflammatory changes were noted on both legs (Figure ). Corticosteroid therapy was discontinued. The patient was educated about her allergy to allopurinol and about not taking this medication in the future.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [71, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.4, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Female'}",40.222,38.211,42.233,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 71 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.4/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**71 * 1.012 = 40.222.
Hence, the GFR value is 40.222 ml/min/1.73 m²."
4053,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7017661-1,Extracted,"A 59-year-old female of height 156 cm with carcinoma of lung left lower lobe was posted for left lower lobectomy. Her preoperative assessment revealed adequate cardiopulmonary reserve and had predicted postoperative Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) of 58%. Anaesthetic plan included thoracic epidural analgesia and general anaesthesia. During intubation there was difficulty in negotiation of tracheal cuff of 35- French left sided double lumen tube (DLT) through the glottis. Hence a 7-French bronchial blocker (Arndt- Cook® Medical) was chosen for lung isolation. A 7.5 mm endotracheal tube was placed through which bronchial blocker was placed in left main bronchus guided by a fibreootic bronchoscope (FOB). Position of the bronchial blocker and isolation of left lung was ensured by FOB in right-lateral position. After docking of the Robotic da Vinci Xi® surgical system, capnothorax was created in left pleural cavity with pressure of 8 mmHg. Commencement of dissection of left lower bronchus resulted in sudden increase in EtCO2 with intermittent normal range of EtCO2. Patient's heart rate, saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, temperature, and airway pressure were stable throughout the procedure. Arterial blood gas revealed partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg. Suspecting increased systemic absorption of CO2 from capnothorax, respiratory rate was increased to increase minute-ventilation [tidal volume-300 ml, respiratory rate – 18.min-1, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4 cm H2O]. Few minutes later, EtCO2 continued to rise up to 114 mmHg [] with PaCO2 of 42 mmHg. At this point, the left lung remained collapsed and bronchial cuff position was confirmed by FOB. On inspection, open left lower lobe bronchus communicating with capnothorax was suspected to be the cause for negative arteriolar to EtCO2 gradient []. The surgeon was notified regarding the same and the capnothorax pressure was reduced to 5 mmHg (6.5 cmH2O). PEEP was increased to 8 cmH2O thereby reversing the pressure gradient across the open bronchus and proximal bronchial cuff. These manoeuvres led to the reduction in efflux of capnothorax CO2 into the airway which was reflected in EtCO2. Thoracoscopic lobectomy was continued and rest of the procedure was uneventful.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [156.0, 'cm']}",48.759,46.321,51.197,"The patient's gender is Female.

Retinopathy was diagnosed in the mid-90s. The patient had been treated several times with focal laser photocoagulation. In 2003 he developed proliferative retinopathy and was treated with photocoagulation. In addition to glimepiride and the ACE-inhibitor quinapril, medication included metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin and aspirin. In 1995–1997, his blood pressure (BP) was on average 125/90 mm Hg. Over the same period, the patient's bodyweight varied between 89 kg and 85 kg. Traditional dietary counselling for weight loss usually resulted in a short-term loss of a few kg, but the bodyweight soon increased again.
In July 1997 albuminuria was noted with a urine concentration of 116 mg/l. That year the patient's average body mass index (BMI) was 29.4 kg/m2 and the average bodyweight was 87.0 kg.
Insulin treatment was started four months later resulting in a temporary improvement of HbA1c but an increase in bodyweight. One year later, his BMI was 32.5 kg/m2 and his weight was 94 kg. The insulin dose was lowered in order to avoid further increase in bodyweight. In the years 1998–1999, following the weight increase and despite improved glycemic control, his BP increased to an average 145/90 mm Hg. Likewise, urine albumin increased as seen in the Figure. In 2000, despite a still reasonable glycemic control but following further weight increase, the albuminuria reached an average of more than 2000 mg/l and the BP was 160/90 mm Hg. Both were controlled by exchanging quinapril for the angiotensin II receptor antagonist candesartan, and by adding amlopidine. The BP has since been stable, averaging 130/76 (± 10/7) mm Hg, but the decline of renal function continued. The Figure shows the albuminuria record and the increase in HbA1c, serum creatinine and body weight with increasing insulin dosage.
In January 2004 his diet was changed radically by reducing dietary carbohydrates to 80–90 g per day, consisting only of vegetables and small amounts of hard bread (crisp bread). Potatoes, bread, pasta, rice and cereals were excluded, and the caloric requirements were covered by protein and fat. To ease the transition the patient was supplied with a number of meal recipes suggesting a caloric restriction to about 1800 calories per day. The per cent proportions of carbohydrates, fat and protein in the recipes were 20 : 50: 30.
Less than two weeks later the patient discontinued his insulin treatment and 6 months later his bodyweight had decreased by 19 kg. HbA1c had dropped to 6.5 % after 3 months, and the steady rise of his serum creatinine stopped. The creatinine has since – for two-and-a-half years – been stable as seen in the figure. When insulin was discontinued rosiglitazone was prescribed. In the Table measured parameters are shown before the dietary change, and now. As of late 2005 there was no sign of proliferative disease in the patient's retinopathy.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [94.0, 'kg']}",134.0,127.3,140.7,"The patient's weight is 94.0 kg.

132,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-4370314-1,Extracted,"A 65-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with HIV infection in October 2005. There were no comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. cART, comprising lamivudine, abacavir and atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg of atazanavir boosted by 100 mg of ritonavir), was started to treat his low CD4+ T-cell count (205 cells/μL) and high HIV-RNA (230 000 copies/mL) in June 2006. Soon after the initiation of cART, both proteinuria and hematuria emerged (1+ and 1+ on dipstick test, respectively) and his renal function started to decline slowly, yet there were no crystalline precipitates in the urine. Serum creatinine (Cr) increased from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL in June 2009, and to 1.4 mg/dL in February 2012, with persistent proteinuria (1+) and occult hematuria (2+) on a dipstick test. As serum Cr increased to 1.7 mg/dL, he was admitted to the Department of Nephrology in April 2012. The cART regimen remained unchanged, since the control of HIV infection was good at the time.
On admission, his blood pressure was 102/78 mmHg and pulse rate 98 beats per minute. His height was 154 cm and his weight was 35.4 kg (body mass index, 14.9 kg/m2). There were no particular abnormalities on physical examination. The blood data were as follows: white blood cell count 6400/μL; red blood cell count 387 × 104/μL; hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL; platelet count 27.0 × 104/μL; serum urea nitrogen 21 mg/dL; serum Cr 1.7 mg/dL; serum sodium 139 mEq/L; serum potassium 4.5 mEq/L; serum chloride 103 mEq/L and serum C-reactive protein 0.49 mg/dL. Urine dipstick test showed pH 6.0, proteinuria (1+), and occult blood (3+). The urinary concentrations of biomarkers for tubular damage, which was corrected for urinary Cr concentrations, were as follows: N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), 12.0 IU/gCr (normal level of NAG concentration, 0.0–7.0 IU/L) and β2M, 391 μg/gCr (normal level of β2M concentration, 27–265 μg/L), respectively. The daily amount of urinary protein was 250 mg. Urinary sediments included 50–99 red blood cells/high power field (HPF), 20–29 white blood cells/HPF and small amounts of crystalline precipitation (no detail for its shape). Infrared spectroscopic analysis was implemented to test whether the urinary crystalline precipitation included atazanavir crystals. In brief, the patient's urine was stored for 24 h, and some of the urine was centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was used for infrared spectroscopic analysis, and the spectrum of the infrared absorbance was compared with that of the standard for atazanavir analysis (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). This analysis strongly indicated that the urinary crystalline precipitation of the patient included atazanavir crystals (Figure ). The first renal biopsy was performed in May 2012. The kidney tissue contained eight glomeruli, one of which (12.5%) was globally sclerotic. The remaining glomeruli showed no convincing histological changes indicating renal failure. In contrast, interstitial nephritis, accompanied by diffuse inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells, was noted (Figure A). Moreover, needle-shaped crystalline precipitation, likely in the epithelia of the tubule, surrounded by multinuclear giant cells, was very characteristic (Figure B). Immunohistochemistry was negative. Electron microscopy showed no electron-dense deposits in the glomeruli; however, crystalline precipitation was confirmed within the tubular epithelial cells (Figure C). In June 2012, atazanavir was replaced by raltegravir, but renal function did not improve. From November 2012, 6 months after the first renal biopsy, oral prednisolone was started at the initial dose of 0.75 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks, and was slowly decreased in the subsequent 5 months. However, serum Cr remained constant at 1.5 mg/dL. In August 2013 (1 year and 3 months after the first renal biopsy), a second renal biopsy contained 28 glomeruli, 5 of which (17.9%) were globally sclerotic. The remaining 23 glomeruli had unremarkable changes. Needle-shaped crystals surrounded by lymphocytes and multinuclear giant cells in the tubulointerstitial compartment were completely removed. Sclerotic findings of glomeruli and intrarenal arterioles including interlobular arteries were more prominent than those observed in the first renal biopsy. Additionally, tubular atrophy and interstitial-fibrosis developed further, although the severe interstitial inflammation was almost cured (Figure D). Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy showed no characteristic findings.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [35.4, 'kg'], 'height': [154.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [1.7, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [65, 'years']}",21.691,20.606,22.776,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 65 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 154.0 cm, which is 154.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.54 m. The patient's weight is 35.4 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 35.4 kg / (1.54 m * 1.54 m) = 14.927 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 14.9, indicating they are underweight.
Because the patient is underweight, we take the patient's weight, 35.4 kg as the patient's adjusted weight needed for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. 
Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 65) * 35.4 * 1) / (1.7 * 72) = 21.691 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 21.691 mL/min."

Negative family history for coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy or thrombotic disease. He sought medical attention because of insidious retrosternal chest fatigue and discomfort evolving for a month, with strong intensity and short duration, related to intense physical efforts (soccer training) and relieved at rest.
He denied irradiation or associated symptoms, but presented progressive symptom worsening. The patient, who initially only had indefinite tiredness at the end of the match, ended up developing burning chest pain early in the training.
Upon physical examination, the patient was well overall, eupneic at ambient air, normal color, acyanotic, feverless and anicteric.
The patient weighed 79 kg; 1.79 m tall; with a heart rate of 60bpm; and blood pressure (BP) at 120/80 mmHg.
Chest examination showed an apical thrust and normal heart and lung sounds.
Pulses were symmetrical with normal amplitudes and there was no peripheral edema. Laboratory tests within normal limits.
Resting ECG evidenced ARV with anterior septum T-wave inversion ().
Following the investigation, he underwent ergospirometric testing that showed no arrhythmias or electrocardiographic changes for myocardial ischemia, but there were symptoms of mild typical chest pain during the examination and abnormal findings concerning oxygen consumption (VO2) - 48.3mL/kg/min (the reference standard was 48.9); and the oxygen pulse was 21.1 ml 02/bpm (the reference standard was 19.9), with a plateau curve at the peak effort reached.
He then underwent transesophageal echocardiography, which showed normal wall thickness and dimensions, no septal defects and normal LV systo diastolic function, despite anteroapical hypokinesia.
The patient remained with anginal pain when an anatomical evaluation with CT angiography was necessary and showed proximal obstruction in the ADA which presented normal distal flow due to the receipt of collateral circulation in the right circumflex and coronary arteries.
The examination disregarded coronary atherosclerosis ( and ). Thrombophilias, rheumatological, inflammatory and connective tissue diseases were also investigated; with negative results.
Due to the obstruction of the ADA, we investigated the repercussion of this lesion on ventricular function by myocardial scintigraphy, which showed transient hypocaptation in the anterior, apical and septal walls with great extent, reaching 28% of the LV.
Once the lesion was evidenced and its relevant repercussion was demonstrated, the patient was submitted to CATE, confirming the previous findings, in which the ADA TCA was performed with a pharmacological stent (Promus 4.0 × 2.8 mm), although the patient was aware of the possibility of distal embolization, resulting in a final TIMI 3 flow.
After the procedure, the patient remained asymptomatic receiving daily ASA, prasugrel and continued cardiac rehabilitation.
A control scintigraphy, after three months of CATE, demonstrated total reversal of myocardial ischemia.
Currently, the patient remains asymptomatic, performing outpatient follow-up, and practicing intense physical activity.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [1.79, 'm']}",74.086,70.382,77.79,"The patient's gender is Male.

Blood pressure improved to 111/54 with HR increasing to the low 30’s. Lab work at outside hospital showed sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.0 mmol/L, chloride 107 mmol/L, with a BUN of 41 mg/dL and creatinine 2.32 mg/dL. POC glucose was 191 and AST 55 U/L with ALT 37 U/L. Her hyperkalemia was treated with insulin and dextrose and had returned to normal limits by time of presentation. Repeat kidney, liver function tests, and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. Troponins were drawn and found to be 0.062 ng/mL with a Brain Natriuretic Peptide of 60 pg/ml. ECG was performed and showed patient had a complete heart block. The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit where transcutaneous pacing was attempted but found to be ineffective. The patient was brought to the cardiac cath lab for transvenous pacing. Review of prior to admission medications showed that the patient had taken her PO pyridostigmine prior to developing bradycardia with altered mental status. She denied taking any of her COPD medication prior to presentation including any short or long acting beta agonists. Neurology was consulted for further evaluation of causes of heart block in a patient with MG. Pyridostigmine was held for concern of its affect in leading to complete heart block. With pyridostigmine held, the patient reverted back to sinus rhythm and transvenous pacing was removed. Using the Naranjo scale for adverse drug reaction patient received a score of 6 for a probable adverse drug reaction. Given the patient’s lack of infectious etiology, including negative Lyme serology, alternative pharmacological causes of heart block and reversion to sinus rhythm after removal of the offending agent, pyridostigmine was diagnosed as the causative agent.

The patient described the weakness as progressive in nature that had begun two weeks prior. One week after the onset of her initial weakness, she had begun to suffer from minor falls due to the right hemiparesis. Her family was present at the bedside and noted that they had observed a mild left-sided facial droop and slurred speech several days before. She denied any head trauma or confusion; however, she admitted to mild right-hand tremors that had started one month prior. Her past medical history was significant for RA, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. She was on chronic therapy for RA with methotrexate (7.5 mg PO once every week) and infliximab (3 mg/kg IV every eight weeks) for the past two years. Her family and social history were noncontributory, apart from her owning a cat.
On physical examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact, and pupils were 3 mm and reactive. Both upper and lower extremity motor strength was 5/5 on the left and 4/5 on the right. There were no tremors or facial droop noted at the time of the exam.

MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed bilateral ring-enhancing lesions in the basal ganglia (left larger than right) with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle from the larger lesion as shown in Figures , . CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without contrast was performed and was negative for primary malignancy.
Due to the characteristics of the lesions on MRI, there was high suspicion for brain metastases, which prompted a brain biopsy of the left intracranial intraparenchymal mass for diagnosis. The tissue specimen showed necrotic brain tissue with patchy marked inflammatory changes as well as structures morphologically compatible with tachyzoites of toxoplasmosis. Special stains for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, acid-fast bacilli, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 were all negative. Immunohistochemistry for toxoplasma was positive and a diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was made. Serology revealed that the anti-toxoplasma immunoglobulin G was >400 IU/mL (positive). The patient had a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen and antibody screen as well as a normal T cell count (T cell total 1,499 and CD4 786). The patient was started on dexamethasone due to cerebral edema and her immunosuppressive medications were discontinued. As pyrimethamine was unavailable, treatment began with high-dose TMP-SMX (400 mg q12h).

The patient complained of generalized myalgias, nonproductive cough, and runny nose in the preceding few days for which she called her primary care physician and was given a script of oseltamivir, attributing the symptoms to influenza virus infection. Pertinent past medical history included hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, with the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45 milliequivalent/liter, and type II diabetes (DMT-2). Her medications included metformin, pioglitazone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe. She used to live by herself and didn’t drink or smoke. Vitals in the ER were temperature: 93 F, pulse: 55/min, blood pressure: 96/54 mmHg, oxygen saturation: 98% on ambient air, and respiratory rate: 28/min.
Physical examination showed that she was lethargic and oriented only to self, with dry mucosal membranes and cold, clammy skin. The neck was supple; extraocular movements were intact. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The rest of the examination, including the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, were unremarkable.

Venous blood gas analysis showed pH: 7.009, pCO2: 18.2 mmHg, and bicarbonate level: 5.1 mmol/L. Serum osmolarity was 312 mOsm/kg, with an osmolar anion gap of 12 mOsm/kg. Urinalysis showed glucose of 500 mg/dL, proteinuria of 30 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a first-degree heart block and broad QRS complex, as shown in Figure .
Computerized tomographic scan (CT) head and chest X-ray were unremarkable.
She was aggressively resuscitated with intravenous (IV) fluids. Hyperkalemia was treated with IV insulin, dextrose, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and inhaled albuterol. Urgent hemodialysis was also arranged. Attributing her acute severe metabolic acidosis to influenza complicated by bacterial superinfection, she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and oseltamivir, and workup for acute renal failure, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), complement levels, urine eosinophils, and renal ultrasound, was ordered. After hemodialysis (HD), electrolytes improved to a bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/L, potassium of 3.8 meq/L, and a pH of 7.433. She remained hemodynamically stable at this point. Repeat metabolic profile (BMP) fours hour after the completion of HD showed the bicarbonate level dropping down to 13 meq/L again. Endocrinology was consulted due to persistent metabolic acidosis. At this point, the patient recalled that she was also taking dapagliflozin (an SGLT-2 inhibitor) up to two weeks before the presentation when she stopped taking it due to her improving HbA1c.
Her serum beta-hydroxybutyrate result came back at 92.5 mg/dl. She was started on IV insulin and dextrose. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate started improving and resolved entirely within 15 hours of beginning IV insulin, and bicarbonate improved to 22 meq/l. Later on, her urine output improved and electrolytes stabilized without further need for HD. Creatinine trended down and stabilized at 2.5 meq/L.
She resumed a regular diet, and beta-hydroxybutyrate remained within the normal range. Her blood sugar levels remained in the range of 110-150 mg/dl without hypoglycemic agents. Workup for acute renal failure came back negative.

Her medical history consisted of malaria in her childhood and one month prior she gave birth to her first child. The labor was induced with secondary cesarean section because of general discomfort, raised inflammatory laboratory markers and raised liver function tests of unknown cause.
Clinical examination revealed abdominal distention and tenderness in the epigastric region without muscular defense. She denied having vaginal purulent discharge and lower abdominal pain. Her vital signs demonstrated a blood pressure of 100/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 124 bpm and a body temperature of 38 °C.
Laboratory studies revealed raised inflammatory markers (total WBC count of 11,700/mm3, CRP level of 170 mg/l), mild microcytic anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dl, MCV 76 fL), significant thrombocytosis (953,000 /mm3) and mildly raised liver function tests (AST 23 U/L, ALT 51 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 279 U/l, gamma-glutamyl transferase 74 U/l). Bilirubin, albumin and prothrombin time were normal.
Viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Malaria were excluded.
Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of ascites in the small pelvis and around the liver, with normal liver size and parenchyma. Subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed peritoneal thickening and hypervascular adnexes with a small para-uterine abcedation on the right side, suggestive for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (Fig. ). There were no enlarged lymph nodes and the liver veins were patent.
Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis with evacuation of purulent fluid was performed. Ascitic fluid analysis showed a serum-ascites albumin gradient less than 1.1 g/dL with cytology showing a predominance of lymphocytic cells.
Acid fast stained smear (Ziehl-Neelsen staining) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. tuberculosis on ascitic fluid were negative.
Tuberculin skin test was negative and there were no signs suggestive of (previous) tuberculosis on chest radiography.
Gynecological evaluation revealed purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness. Endocervical culture was negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis. Acid fast stained smear was also negative.
Subsequently a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, showing multiple peritoneal white nodules and perihepatic “violin string” fibrinous strands (Fig. ). These findings were very suggestive for peritoneal tuberculosis with Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome.
Acid fast stained smear and PCR for M. Tuberculosis on peritoneal biopsies were both negative.
Since the perioperative findings were very suggestive, the patient was started on quadruple anti-tuberculous therapy, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Rapid clinical improvement and regression of the inflammatory markers and ascites was observed.
The pathology report of the peritoneal biopsies eventually confirmed peritonitis with granulomas.

In the past year, he experienced polydipsia and polyuria. Physical examination revealed body weight 17.5 kg (50th percentile), body height 100 cm (15~50th percentile), blood pressure 230/120 mmHg, heart rate 138 /min, and decreased skin turgor. There was no focal neurological deficit, blood pressure discrepancy between upper and lower extremities, palpable mass, nor any appreciation of an abdominal thrill. Laboratory studies revealed serum Na+ 124 mmol/L, K+ 2.4 mmol/L, Cl− 87 mmol/L, Ca2+ 8.5 mg/dL, HCO3− 34.5 mEq/L, creatinine 0.41 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, IgG 247 mg/dL, and osmolality 290 mOsm/KgH2O.

Survey for possible glomerulonephritis demonstrated the absence of anti-streptolysin O, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, ANA, and normal immunoglobulin A, C3, and C4 levels. In addition, work-up for secondary hypertension included: free T4 1.51 (normal range 0.8–2.0 ng/dL), TSH 5.7 (normal range 0.25–5.00 μIU/mL), cortisol 40.18 (normal range 4.3–25 μg/dL), ACTH 9.32 (normal range < 46 pg/mL), renin 1745 (normal range 2–15 ng/L), aldosterone 92.6 (normal range 4–25 ng/dL), and urine vanillylmandelic acid 3.8 (normal range 1.9–9.9 g/day). Renal ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic right kidney (7.6 cm in length) and small left kidney (5.3 cm in length). Due to the presence of hyperreninemic hypertension, natriuretic-hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and nephrotic range proteinuria, HHS was highly suspected. Computed tomography angiography confirmed high-grade renal artery stenosis with hypoplasia of the left kidney (Fig. ).
In terms of management for this case, we began with volume repletion by normal saline administration. Subsequently, his blood pressure declined from 210/120 mmHg to 180/90 mmHg. Intravenous calcium channel blocker was used to treat his hypertensive emergency, while oral captopril was prescribed for RAA axis blockage after diagnosis of unilateral renal artery stenosis. The systolic blood pressure gradually declined to 150~160 mmHg on the 3rd day. Potassium supplement was infused for his profound hypokalemia and generalized muscle weakness. Due to the severity of left renal artery stenosis, he was not a candidate for angiographic intervention, and decision was made to proceed with left nephrectomy. Overall, electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia were corrected within 1 week after admission, and resolution of polyuria, polydipsia, proteinuria, and hypertension were achieved 2 weeks after nephrectomy (Additional file : Table S1).",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [87.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [34.5, 'mEq/L'], 'Sodium': [124.0, 'mmol/L']}",2.5,2.375,2.625,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 124.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 124.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 124.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 124.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 124.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 124.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 87.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 87.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 87.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 87.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 87.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 87.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 34.5 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 124.0 mEq/L - (87.0 mEq/L + 34.5 mEq/L) = 2.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 2.5 mEq/L."

She was delivered vaginally at full-term. During the neonatal period, she was hypotonic and very passive. Her growth milestones were recalled. She walked at 1 year and 8 months of age, and learned to say “mama” at 2 years. She talked at nearly 3 years and showed severe ID. She began the first period of menstrual at the age of 13 years, and got married at 18 years. She was in pregnancy at 18 weeks’ gestation when referred for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. She had facial dysmorphism including a prominent forehead; flat face; flat nasal bridge and a short upturned nose; thin lips; and small ears (Fig. ). Examinations in psychological clinic showed that her height was 154 cm [0 SD]; weight was 61 kg [− 0.2 SD]; and head circumference was 54 cm [− 1.12 SD] [, ]. Her IQ score was 32 as accessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised China (WAIS-RC). In terms of the scale, a score ≤ 75 is considered as low intelligence, and a score of 32 suggests severe ID. Reportedly, she was able to care for herself in daily life. Clinical observation showed that she was introverted; seldom talked; had dementia and social dysfunction without depression and anxiety. Both her electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain MRI result were normal. No history of heart diseases was noted. Her father was reported to have low intelligence, but an on-site examination for her father was not achieved. Her mother was of normal intelligence but had scoliosis. Her paternal grandparents and uncles and the fetus’ father had no noticeable congenital anomalies.
Written informed consent was obtained from the family (The proband was under the guardianship of her mother). Peripheral blood for each participant and the amniotic fluid of the proband were drawn for genetic testing. Heart rate, blood pressure and electrocardiogram of the proband were monitored before amniocentesis. Conventional G-banded karyotype analysis showed a normal female karyotype (46,XX) in the proband. However, CMA using the CytoScan 750 K Array from Affymetrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) revealed a 936.3 kb heterozygous deletion of chromosome 1q22 (arr[GRCh37] 1q22 (155016052_155952375)×1) in the proband (Fig. ). The microdeletion was also detected in the proband’s father (II-2) and the fetus (IV-1), but absent in her mother (II-1), grandparents (I-1, I-2) and paternal uncles (II-3, II-4). Other members within the pedigree were not tested. For all tested individuals, no other CNVs were detected except known polymorphisms (frequency > 1%).
In search of public databases (Decipher, DGV and ClinVar) and literature, a few cases reported copy number losses of the 1q22 region including ASH1L and the associated phenotypes including ID with MCA (Table ). Furthermore, haploinsufficiency of ASH1L is strongly associated with DD/ID and MCA in multiple individual cases [, ]. On the basis of these observations, plus the co-segregation of genotype and phenotype in the current case, the detected CNV is considered to be pathogenic, being in line with the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) [].

The patient was on triple immunosuppression with steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine and had stable graft function. He was followed-up regularly in the renal transplant clinic and the immediate post-transplant period was uneventful. In 2001, the serum creatinine was gradually increased to 3 mg/dl. He underwent an allograft biopsy, which revealed an interstitial nephritis/tubular atrophy grade II. The cyclosporine dosage was reduced (150 mg/day given twice daily) to minimize the chronic nephrotoxicity and MMF (2 g/day in two divided doses) was substituted for azathioprine to control chronic allograft nephropathy. At that time, the patient was afebrile and had a normal physical examination. After conversion, serum creatinine level fell to 2.5 mg/dl. However, he presented with complaints of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever requiring hospital admission twelve days later. MMF was withdrawn but cyclosporine and prednisolone were continued.
On admission, physical examination revealed a moderately dehydrated patient with temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure of 105/55 mm Hg, heart rate of 110 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. Abdominal examination showed a moderately distended abdomen with epigastric tenderness, but no mass or rigidity.

There was a mild rise in serum creatinine value (2.8 mg/dl). A complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 11.4×109/L with 65% neutrophils, a hematocrit level of 32.6%. Liver transaminases, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, lipid profile and electrolytes tests were within the normal ranges. Evaluation for infectious etiology revealed a negative work-up for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen. Blood testing for CMV and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), by PCR was also negative. The electrocardiogram showed normal QRS complexes. Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated an enlarged and heterogeneous of his pancreas with poorly delineated borders, consistent with acute pancreatitis. His gallbladder, biliary duct system and spleen were normal. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed on the basis of laboratory data and imaging findings during hospital admission. He had no history of pancreatitis or other its risk factors. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluid and cyclosporine was withdrawn. However, he developed hypotension and respiratory failure requiring transfer to the intensive care unit for ventilatory and inotropic support. Unfortunately, his symptoms worsened, and despite an intensive care, his clinical state deteriorated and he died one week later and autopsy findings demonstrated acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

According to the AML12 protocol of the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG), she received combination chemotherapy (cytarabine, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, idarubicin, and etoposide) as induction therapy and achieved complete remission. Neutropenia became apparent 6 days after maintenance therapy, with neutrophil counts of <500/μL, and the patient developed febrile episodes with shaking chills 9 days after maintenance therapy. She appeared toxic, and her temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were 38.7°C, 88/48 mmHg, 108/min, and 24/min, respectively.
Laboratory examination revealed a decreased leukocyte count of <100/μL and elevated C-reactive protein level of 3.58 mg/dL (reference range, <0.5 mg/dL). After two consecutive blood cultures taken from the peripheral vein and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, meropenem (40 mg/kg/dose, 3 times/day) was administered as empiric therapy. The standard blood culture exhibited only coryneform Gram-positive, club-shaped, slightly curved rods from the aerobic bottle 1 day after culture. Her temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were 36.7°C, 76/40 mmHg, 96/min, and 18/min, respectively. We then added vancomycin (15 mg/kg/dose, 4 times/day) to the treatment protocol and removed the PICC line on the second day of the febrile episode. The duration of PICC placement was 69 days.
Using a MALDI Biotyper (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) with laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we identified B. casei in the positive blood cultures containing samples taken from the peripheral vein and PICC line []. B. casei also grew in the sample collected from the PICC tip, based on which we made a diagnosis of CRBSI caused due to B. casei.
After a 24 h incubation at 37°C in a CO2 atmosphere, the Gram-positive rods formed colonies on sheep blood agar that were whitish to gray-white in color, non-hemolytic, smooth, and round and had a distinctive cheese odor (). The isolate was positive for catalase, α-glucosidase, and gelatin hydrolysis, while negative for urease, oxidase, and nitrate reduction. These biochemical features were typical of B. casei. Drug sensitivity tests were analyzed using the broth microdilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration for the isolate was >4 μg/mL for ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, and tazobactam/piperacillin; >2 μg/mL for cefazolin and cefmetazole; ≤2 μg/mL for cefepime; 0.25 μg/mL for meropenem; 2 μg/mL for clarithromycin; 4 μg/mL for ciprofloxacin; and 0.5 μg/mL for vancomycin.
There is no standardized treatment for B. casei bacteremia, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2011 criteria for interpreting susceptibility results are based on the recommendations that apply to Corynebacterium spp. []. In our case, antimicrobial therapy with meropenem and vancomycin and PICC line removal consequently led to a significant clinical improvement of the symptoms. We performed antimicrobial treatment for 19 days until the patient's neutropenia was ameliorated, and she recovered without sequelae.

Visual acuity progressively declined within 1 month to seeing only contours. Upon ophthalmological work-up, LHON was suspected. Visual acuity slightly improved over the following years. The diagnosis was genetically confirmed by detection of the primary LHON mutation m.3460G>A at the age of 49 years. At the age of 60 years, he underwent right hip replacement therapy. At the age of 61 years, he experienced a speech disturbance for 4 days, which was attributed to an ischaemic stroke in the right frontoparietal and occipitoparietal regions with complete remission. Carotid ultrasound at that time revealed occlusion of the right carotid artery. A mild stenosis was diagnosed on the left carotid artery. Cardiovascular risk factors included arterial hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Since the age of 65 years, he has experienced recurrent nonsystematic vertigo. He had a previous history of smoking 5 pack/years until the age of 61 years. His history was further positive for recurrent, sometimes traumatic falls. The family history was positive for LHON in his brother, the oldest sister of his mother, the second sister of his mother, and one female cousin. The mutation of the index case was also found in his brother and one aunt. The brother with LHON had LVHT, a complex-I defect on biochemical investigations of the muscle homogenate, was an alcoholic, had died suddenly, and had been previously described. The index patient’s mother had died from a ‘valve abnormality’. His brother had WPW syndrome as well.
At the age of 66 years, he was able to read letters with a height of approximately 4 cm and was able to watch television on an oversized screen. He was in a depressive mood since the death of his partner 5 years earlier and the sudden, unexplained death of his brother 1 year earlier, whom he found dead in his flat. Neurological examinations revealed markedly reduced visual acuity, positional tremor, past-pointing bilaterally, and reduced Achilles tendon reflexes (already present at age 50 years but not at age 24 years). Serum lactate, which was normal at age 24 years, was 2.5 mmol/l (normal range, 0.5–1.6 mmol/l), creatine kinase was 238 U/l (normal value, <190 U/l), and folic acid was 2.49 ng/ml (normal range, 4.6–18.7 ng/ml). Nerve conduction studies revealed a sensory polyneuropathy of the mixed type in the lower legs. Carotid ultrasound confirmed the previously diagnosed occlusion of the right carotid artery but could not confirm stenosis of the left carotid artery, where only plaques were found.
Cardiologically, the patient had a history of poorly controlled arterial hypertension since the age of 25 years. At 50 years of age, he started suffering from palpitations. At that time, electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a delta wave indicating WPW syndrome, signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and a right bundle-branch-block (RBBB). Echocardiography revealed an increased thickness of the left ventricular walls and LVHT affecting the apex and the posterior wall. Systolic function was normal. By Doppler-sonography, diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation) was diagnosed. Treatment with 20 mg lercanidipine, orally, twice daily and 32 mg candesartan, orally, daily was initiated. His history was negative for syncopes, atrial fibrillation, or resuscitation. The patient refused further cardiological follow-up.
In May 2017, at the age of 66 years, the patient was admitted to the Second Medical Department with Cardiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, Vienna, Austria because of increasing vertigo during the previous 1 year and agreed to undergo further cardiological investigations. The clinical cardiological examination was normal. Blood pressure was initially high but normal at discharge. Transthoracic echocardiography showed LVHT and myocardial thickening but normal systolic function. The ECG was unchanged showing RBBB, occasional ventricular ectopic beats, and WPW syndrome with a PQ-time of 104 ms and an intermittent delta wave. During telemetric monitoring, multiple ventricular ectopic beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were observed. Echocardiographically, left ventricular wall thickening had increased and LVHT was only visible in the posterior wall (). During stress-testing, the RBBB morphology of the QRS-complex disappeared at 55 Watts and recurred during rest. Considering these findings and the family history, it was decided to perform an electrophysiological investigation because of suspected left lateral pathway of the WPW syndrome. Electrophysiological investigations revealed a ‘bizarre’ cardiac conduction system, which is why the cardiologists refrained from undertaking radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Instead, implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was proposed but refused by the patient. His last medications included: 50 mg trazodone, orally, daily; 100 mg acetyl-salicylic acid orally, daily; 20 mg lercanidipine, orally, twice daily; 32 mg candesartan, orally, daily; 2 mg lorazepam, orally, daily; 4 mg doxazosin, orally, three-times daily; 10 mg escitalopram, orally, daily; 10 mg ezetimibe, orally, daily; 1 mg rilmenidine, orally, twice daily; and 5 mg folic acid, orally, daily.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [98.0, 'kg'], 'height': [186.0, 'cm']}",87.454,83.081,91.827,"The patient's gender is Male.

971,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-7451141-1,Extracted,"This is a 66-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis C virus infection, and atrial fibrillation chronically anticoagulated with apixaban. He was brought in by emergency services after a fall. The patient reported dizziness, then lost consciousness, and was found down by a family member. Primary trauma survey was negative with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 no focal neurological deficits. Noncontrast CT of the head [] was significant for a 6 mm right frontal SDH with no shift, as well as a right medial orbital wall fracture. As the patient was neurologically intact, had minimal mass effect, there was no operative intervention recommended.
The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for serial checks. On the 2nd hospital day, he developed severe headache, and the head CT was repeated [], which showed worsening of the SDH with associated mass effect and 2 mm midline shift. The patient remained neurologically intact; therefore, no surgical intervention was recommended. The patient was discharged to acute inpatient rehabilitation on the 6th hospital day with instructions to repeat the head CT in 2 weeks.
In rehabilitation, 6 days after discharge, the patient experienced a terrible headache for 3 days, which prompted a repeat neurosurgical evaluation. The patient was still neurologically intact at this time, and repeat CT head [] showed expansion of the hematoma to 15 mm, with increased mass effect and 8 mm midline shift. The patient underwent burr holes for evacuation of the SDH and placement of subdural drain. Following hematoma evacuation, the patient’s headache improved, and the SDH decreased in size on repeat CT head []. His postoperative course was without complication. The drain was removed and the patient was discharged home on the 2nd postoperative day with levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis.
On the 14th postoperative day, the patient was seen in the office for follow-up. The patient described a strange sensation in the right arm, as well as the feeling that he could not control the arm. Based on these symptoms, he was sent directly to the emergency room for further evaluation. In the emergency room, the patient developed a focal left arm seizure. He was treated for this seizure and started on electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. He was then admitted. That night, the patient was found to be unresponsive; CT head showed no acute hemorrhage and EEG indicated status epilepticus. The patient was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further management.
As the patient’s initial presentation was hemorrhagic but thought to be traumatic, dedicated vascular imaging had not been obtained previously. During this third admission, cerebral CTA was obtained as his clinical course became suspicious for either an underlying lesion or vascular issue. The studies were negative for any pathology. This admission was complicated by ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, septic shock secondary to Pseudomonas bacteremia, and the patient received a tracheostomy and gastrostomy. The patient was eventually stabilized and discharged to long-term acute care hospital on day 29 with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine for seizure control.
Four days after discharge, the patient was found to be less responsive and was transferred back for neurosurgical evaluation. The patient opened eyes to stimulation, localized with the right upper extremity, and had minimal movement of left upper and bilateral lower extremities, and cough, gag, corneal, and pupillary reflexes were all present. CT and CTA head [] showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 5.2 cm×3.3 cm but no vascular lesion or anomaly. Cerebral catheter angiography was then performed and [ and b] showed prominence of the anterior temporal branch of the right middle cerebral artery with early, rapid, shunting of blood through a cortical vein to the superior sagittal sinus. There was opacification of a capillary-like serpiginous tangle of vessels connecting the anterior temporal artery with the early draining vein, representing an AVM, which was Spetzler-Martin Grade 1 (Spetzler-Ponce Grade A). On the second postangiogram day, embolization of the AVM was performed using N-butyl- cyanoacrylate glue. The embolization was successful and no opacification of the early draining vein or AVM nidus were seen [ and d].
On the 8th day postembolization, the patient was taken to the operating room for resection of the AVM. The right pterional craniotomy was performed to access the AVM, which was separated from surrounding brain parenchyma using microdissection techniques. The feeding arteries, followed by the draining vein, were coagulated using bipolar electrocautery and resected. Following resection, intraoperative Doppler ultrasound indicated no arterial flow in the draining vein. The associated intraparenchymal hematoma was also evacuated. Postoperative angiography showed no residual AVM.
Postoperatively, the patient’s mental status progressively improved. On the 3rd postoperative day, the patient followed commands and tracked with his eyes. There was spontaneous antigravity movement of the right upper extremity, but still no movement of the left upper or bilateral lower extremities. The postoperative course was complicated by pseudomonas sepsis, which was treated in consultation with infectious disease. The patient was eventually discharged to long-term acute care on the 15th postoperative day.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [66, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': False, 'Hypertension history': True, 'Vascular disease history': False, 'Diabetes history': False}",2,2,2,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.
The patient is 66 years old. Because the age is between 65 and 74, one point added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1.
The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1.
The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Because stroke history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.

She had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and permanent AF for 5 years (). Echocardiography performed 3 months before admission revealed severe global left ventricular hypokinesia (ejection fraction=19% by Simpson's method) and an enlarged left atrium (left atrial volume index=40 mL/m2). Her medications included digoxin (0.125 mg daily), warfarin (2 mg daily), ramipril (10 mg daily), furosemide (40 mg daily), spinolactone (25 mg daily), and carvedilol (25 mg daily).
On examination, her heart rate was 41 bpm, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. Heart sounds were regular, and there were no murmurs or thrills. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed junctional rhythm at a rate of 35 bpm and a QRS duration of 136 msec (). Admission laboratory results showed severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium 8.3 mEq/L), high blood urea nitrogen (62.4 mg/dL), creatinine of 4.0 mg/dL, glucose of 248 mg/dL, and low sodium (131 mM) and hemoglobin (7.2 g/dL) levels. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air showed a pH of 7.400, pCO2 of 41.6 mm Hg, pO2 of 102.8 mm Hg, and HCO3- of 26.0 mmol/L.
The patient was immediately treated with intravenous calcium chloride, followed by intravenous glucose/insulin and a sodium bicarbonate infusion. On hospital day 2, the serum potassium level was 5.3 mEq/L and the ECG showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 53 bpm with an 80 ms QRS duration (). On hospital day 3, the ECG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 67 bpm, and the serum potassium level was within normal limits (4.3 mEq/L). The patient was discharged 6 days after admission, and the ECG at discharge showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 65 bpm with occasional premature ventricular complexes. At the 10 day and 1 month follow-ups, the ECG at an outpatient clinic had returned to AF and serum potassium levels were within the normal range.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [74, 'years'], 'creatinine': [4.0, 'mg/dL']}",10.945,10.398,11.492,"The patient is 74 years old.

1703,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-5703586-1,Extracted,"A 73-year-old right-handed African-American female with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Graves’ disease, and essential hypertension presented to the emergency room after the sudden onset of dysarthria and dysphagia six hours prior to the admission. Her dysarthria was marked such that she could not speak one word without significant difficulty. Her dysphagia was noted to solids and liquids when she attempted to drink water and eat chicken at a social function. The patient denied lateralizing weakness, vision loss, confusion, bladder/bowel incontinence, dystonia, or previous episodes of weakness. She did not have a previous history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). She denied a history of recent head trauma, major surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding diathesis, or known neurologic disease. The patient was taking methimazole for Graves’s disease, but four weeks prior to admission, it was held for a radioactive iodine and uptake scan. However, the patient was restarted on a reduced methimazole dose due to increased tremulousness, anxiety, and diarrhea two weeks prior to her presentation in our emergency room. The patient’s initial vital signs were significant for tachycardia up to 116 beats per minute and tachypnea up to 24 breaths per minute, with a presenting blood pressure of 142/84. The physical examination, including a full neurologic exam, revealed only moderate dysarthria with stuttering. The patient’s sensorium, cranial nerve examination, strength, and sensation were intact with no focal weakness, sensory deficits, or cerebellar signs. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score for the patient was three due to her speech difficulties; the airway, breathing, circulation, disability (ABCD) scores were five, and her premorbid Modified Rankin Score was zero. The laboratory findings on admission were significant for a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.01 µIU/mL, free T4 of 4.43 ng/dL, and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins of 537. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 116 beats per minute, normal axis, normal PR and QT intervals, and no ST segment or T wave changes. Computed tomography of the head (CTH) without contrast was negative for hemorrhage. She was admitted to the hospital for concern of CVA versus TIA. The patient did not receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to the duration of her symptoms as well as her low NIHSS score. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was negative for acute ischemic change or space-occupying lesion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck demonstrated no significant intracranial arterial disease. Stroke laboratory evaluation including vitamin B12, homocysteine, human immunodeficiency virus and rapid plasma reagin were all unremarkable. Serial neurologic exams failed to show new or evolving neurological deficits. Despite her negative evaluation, her dysarthria persisted for more than 24 hours after initial hospitalization. Additionally, oropharyngeal dysphagia was appreciated on bedside swallow evaluation by speech therapy. Given the findings on initial laboratory studies, endocrinology was consulted for further recommendations. They increased her methimazole dose and started Propranolol. Within 48 hours of adjusting her anti-hyperthyroid medications, the patient’s dysarthria and dysphagia rapidly improved. Videofluoroscopy on day three of hospitalization showed no evidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia. The patient was discharged on 81 mg aspirin and 40 mg Atorvastatin with the follow-up to endocrinology and neurology as an outpatient. During the outpatient neurology evaluation, the patient continued to be free of dysarthria, dysphagia, and the stigmata of TIA or CVA.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [142.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [84.0, 'mm hg']}",103.333,98.166,108.5,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

7941,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-6402214-1,Extracted,"A 29-year-old male (weight: 58 kg, length: 178 cm, BMI: 18.3 kg/m2; BMI normal range: 18.5 kg/m2 – 25 kg/m2), without significant past medical history, presented at the ED with chest pain and localised neck tenderness. He presented with sudden onset retrosternal chest pain. The pain was described as “mild and continuous” with no radiation or any other associated symptoms (i.e., no dyspnea or cough; no nausea or vomiting). There was no history of preceding trauma, and the patient had no previous medical history of note. Apart from a 5 pack-year history of smoking cigarettes, there were no other cardiovascular risk factors.
The patient did not take regular medication but admitted to marijuana use on a weekly basis as a teenager until the age of 25. He then only used marijuana infrequently (on average once a month). With regard to cocaine, he admitted he had used it twice—the first being a year ago, and the second time a day prior to attending the ED. There was no history of any other recreational drug use.
Following intranasal cocaine inhalation at an evening social gathering, he suffered chest pain and palpitations. In an attempt to ease the chest pain, he smoked a premixed marijuana/tobacco joint (approximately 0.32 grams marijuana []). The joint was smoked as per a normal cigarette technique without prolonged inhalation or Valsalva manoeuvres.
The following morning, he continued to experience retrosternal chest pain, which had since increased in intensity. He now noticed the presence of right-sided neck pain but without muscle tenderness, throat pain, or dyspnea. Despite taking 1 gram of paracetamol, the symptoms were no better and he therefore presented to the ED.
His vital signs were within normal parameters (temperature: 36.1°C, heart rate: 65 bpm, blood pressure: 125/75 mmHg, equal bilaterally with no pulsus paradoxus, respiratory rate: 13/min, oxygen saturation 100% on room air with a GCS of 15/15).
On physical examination, respiratory auscultation was normal without additional sounds; cardiac sounds were unremarkable with no murmurs or clear “Hamman's sign” (a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat. It is best heard over the precordium and is suggestive for pneumopericardium or -mediastinum) [–]. A moderate amount of subcutaneous emphysema on the right side of the neck was noted. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.
Blood analysis was normal (normal haematology and biochemical analysis, normal inflammatory markers and troponins <0.012 ng/mL). Arterial blood gas on room air demonstrated a respiratory alkalosis without metabolic compensation (pH 7.50, pCO2 29.3 mmHg, pO2 119.7 mmHg, base excess 0.3 mmol/L, HCO3− 22.2 mmol/L, saturation 98.2%, and lactate 1.3 mmol/L). ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without ST-elevation with normal repolarisation. A chest X-ray showed subtle evidence of pneumomediastinum and right-sided mild subcutaneous emphysema in the neck (, thick arrow) with air tracking in the centre of the mediastinum (, thin arrow). There is a small denser line along the right cardiomediastinal margin () that is often present in normal X-rays and is attributed to an optical illusion known as the Mach Band effect (a visual pattern due to edge enhancement manifesting as a region of lucency adjacent to convex surfaces). Although it can be normal, taken in association with subcutaneous emphysema and air tracking in the centre of a mediastinum, this is suggestive of a pneumomediastinum [].
As subcutaneous emphysema along with the suggestion of pneumomediastinum was identified on the chest X-ray, further workup with thoracic CT-scan was performed. This confirmed the presence of subcutaneous emphysema with a pneumopericardium, a large pneumomediastinum, and a small pneumothorax (, ). The patient was managed conservatively and kept overnight for observation (continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring with two-hourly blood pressure measurement in addition to pain control titrated to a pain Visual Analogue Scale). A combination of paracetamol and tramadol was sufficient to keep the patient pain free. The following day, his clinical parameters remained within normal limits along with the resolution of chest pain and a largely unremarkable physical examination. He was discharged the next day with expectative approach, oral analgesics, and ambulatory follow-up. Repeat CT after two weeks revealed complete resolution of the free intrathoracic air.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She also had a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, a cholecystectomy (8 years prior) and mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. She had asthma, first diagnosed at age 5, but had not required medication since 10 months prior (when she had pneumonia). The patient conceived by in vitro fertilization. Transabdominal ultrasound 13.1 weeks after conception showed a 15.1week intrauterine gestation, with an echogenic intracardiac focus in the fetal left ventricle, and an anterior, low-lying placenta; amniocentesis revealed a normal male karyotype and an alpha fetoprotein level of 17.63 mcg/mL (0.98 MoM). The patient had gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed at 33 weeks gestation.
At 36-4/7 weeks gestation, the patient presented at 23:10 to an urban hospital emergency department in the Midwest USA with an exacerbation of asthma. She had worsening dyspnea for approximately one week, associated with sharp back pain, a cough with deep breathing, and an episode of syncope with a fall. She had taken no medication for this until the day before, when she started using her inhalers. On examination, her temperature was 35.7o C, heart rate 100/minute, blood pressure 134/83 mm Hg, respirations 20/minute and saturation 93% on room air. She had shallow respirations, but no wheezing. Her saturation was 96% on supplemental oxygen at 1 L/minute and 98% on 5 L/minute by nasal cannula. She was given a combination albuterol and ipratropium treatment. She was discharged at 02:45 with combination fluticasone and salmeterol inhaler and albuterol inhaler. Over the course of the day, her dyspnea worsened.
At 36-6/7 weeks gestation, she returned to the emergency department at 00:40, about 22 hours after her discharge. Her temperature was 35.4o C, pulse 115/minute, blood pressure 112/84 mm Hg, respiratory rate 24/minute and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. She had diffuse pulmonary crackles and mild extremity edema. Her oxygen saturation increased to 96% on supplemental oxygen at 5 L/minute by nasal cannula. At 01:25 she received nebulizer treatment with no improvement. The respiratory therapist heard pulmonary rales over the right middle and lower lobes, and little air movement. A fetal heart monitor was applied. At 02:00 her white blood cell count was 9,600/mm3 (neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 19%, monocytes 5%), hemoglobin 13.9 g/dL, and platelets 160,000/mm3. Chest x-ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate. Fetal heart tracings showed a reactive pattern at a rate of 120-160/minute. At 02:50 the patient was comfortable and able to speak in complete sentences without dyspnea. At 04:00 she was transferred to an inpatient hospital unit.
At 04:30 the patient's temperature was 35.8o C, heart rate 105/minute, blood pressure 104/65 mm Hg, respirations 24/minute and saturation 97% on oxygen at 4 L/minute. She reported dyspnea and back pain she rated 10/10. She had decreased urine output. At 04:45 the patient complained of nausea. Her saturation was 98% on oxygen at 4 L/minute. A bladder catheter was placed. At 05:25 she received another nebulizer treatment with no improvement. She complained of dizziness. At 05:30 she complained of not feeling well, light-headedness and sweatiness. Her blood pressure was 79/62 mm Hg, with unchanged heart rate and respiratory rate. Her glucose was 137 mg/dl. She was given intravenous normal saline for her hypotension, a 500 ml bolus followed by 125 ml/hour. At 06:00 the patient was given azithromycin (500 mg intravenously) for suspected community-acquired pneumonia and she had dyspnea, nausea and a 50 ml emesis. Her temperature was 35o C, pulse 95/minute, blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18/minute and saturation 98% on oxygen at 4 L/minute. She was anxious and diaphoretic. She had pulmonary crackles. She was given ondansetron. At 06:30 her pulse was 110/minute, blood pressure 87/62 mm Hg and respirations 30/minute. At 07:30 the patient was upset, complaining of back pain and discomfort from having a bladder catheter. She said the antibiotic ""made me feel terrible; get me out of here."" She was refusing further antibiotic therapy. At 08:00 she had back and lower abdominal pain. Her heart rate was 106/minute, blood pressure 86/72 mm Hg and saturation 92% on oxygen at 4 L/minute. Her lips were ""dusky"". Her abdomen was non-tender. Her supplemental oxygen was increased. Shortly after 08:00 the nurse was unable to locate fetal heart tones. At 08:30 intrauterine fetal death was confirmed by ultrasound examination. When informed of this, the patient was upset. Her abdomen was non-tender. She requested removal of her bladder catheter so she could go to the bathroom ""normally"". She ambulated to the bathroom, off supplemental oxygen without difficulty, but shortly following this, a nurse was unable to draw blood for blood counts, type and cross-match, and the patient's blood pressure was found to be in the 70s systolic. She was given another 500 ml bolus of normal saline. Over the next 30-45 minutes, the patient had progressive back and lower abdominal pain. She thought she was having uterine contractions. Her abdomen was moderately firm. At 09:00 she was given ceftriaxone (1 gram intravenously). The patient was alert, oriented and talkative, but her skin was becoming cool, and repeated attempts to draw blood and obtain blood pressure by Doppler were unsuccessful.
At 09:25 the patient was transferred to an ICU, where she had dyspnea. She was pale and lethargic, with cold extremities, mottled skin, and fundal tenderness. Bilateral femoral catheters were placed, and aggressive fluid resuscitation started. At 09:30 her temperature was 34.6o C, pulse 106/minute, blood pressure 76 mm Hg systolic and respirations 34/minute. At 10:00, her hemoglobin was 13.4 g/dL, platelets 154,000/mm3, INR 0.97, PTT 25.6 seconds and fibrinogen 433 mg/dL. At 10:10 her temperature was 34.5o C, pulse 102/minute, blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, respiratory rate 36/minute and oxygen saturation 95% on 100% oxygen by non-rebreather mask. She had decreased air entry bilaterally, shallow breathing and pulmonary crackles over the right lower lobe. She developed respiratory distress and her saturation began to drop. The patient was intubated and, shortly following intubation, at 10:25, she became pulseless and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. At 10:45 an infusion of dopamine was started, and arterial blood showed pH 7.17, PCO2 59 mm Hg, PO2 25 mm Hg and bicarbonate 20.7 mEq/L. At 10:55 the patient's white blood cell count was 9,600/mm3 (neutrophils 80%, lymphocytes 15%, monocytes 3%, bands 2%), hemoglobin 13.6 g/dL, platelets 61,000/mm3, INR 1.58, PTT 32.9 seconds and fibrinogen 216 mg/dL. After thirty minutes of resuscitation, the patient's abdomen was tense and fluids would not flow through the femoral lines. The membranes were ruptured, releasing a large amount of bloody fluid.
Cesarean section was performed at 11:00, revealing approximately one liter of clotted blood behind the placenta, and placental abruption was diagnosed. The stillborn fetus was delivered with placenta immediately following. Epinephrine infusion was started at 11:10. The patient continued to have heavy vaginal bleeding, with estimated blood loss of 2 liters. She received 10 units of red blood cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma in addition to 5 liters of normal saline. Attempted resuscitation was halted and death pronounced at 11:25.
Autopsy demonstrated numerous small pulmonary blood vessels containing aggregates of platelets, lipid vacuoles, aggregates of neutrophils, occasional cytokeratin-positive cells, rare condensed fibrin emboli, three probable syncytiotrophoblasts (one cytokeratin positive on immunohistochemical stain), and a fragment of calcified material. Both lungs had red, congested and edematous parenchyma. The left lung weighed 515 grams and the right lung 600 grams. Microscopic examination demonstrated moderate acute pneumonia in right middle and lower lobes with abundant fibrin exudate, and foci of very early acute pneumonia in left upper and lower lobes and right upper lobe with abundant fibrin exudate. There were serous pleural effusions, 300 ml left, 500 ml right.
The heart showed acute cor pulmonale with moderate right ventricular dilatation. There was also moderate dilatation of the left atrium and mitral valve prolapse with moderate redundant tissue, particularly of the posterior leaflet. Microscopic examination of mitral valve showed moderate fibrous and myxoid expansion. The liver showed severe passive congestion in the periphery. There were numerous sites of hemorrhage in lungs, heart, thoracic aorta, liver, hypopharynx, duodenum, stomach, left ovary, left renal pelvis and bladder.
Approximately 20% of the placenta was detached from the uterus, supporting the diagnosis of placental abruption. The uterine placental site had an attached fragment of placenta including villi and calcified material.

6826,51,SIRS Criteria,diagnosis,integer,pmc-7667610-1,Extracted,"A 77-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with intractable nausea and bilious and non-bloody vomiting of one-day duration. This was associated with diffuse abdominal pain which he described as dull, non-radiating, and moderate in severity. His symptoms were exacerbated by oral intake. Prior to his presentation, he had normal bowel movements. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysphagia, diarrhea, or constipation. Past medical and surgical histories were noncontributory. The patient previously smoked 1.5 packs per day for 20 years but quit 31 years ago. He reported moderate alcohol use and denied illicit drug use.
Three weeks prior to his presentation to the emergency department, he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He did not receive chemotherapy and elected for conservative management as well as palliative care. One day prior to his presentation, he underwent EUS-guided CPN for palliation of his debilitating pain. The procedure involved injecting bupivacaine and 98% absolute alcohol under general anesthesia to induce unilateral celiac plexus neurolysis. There were no immediate post-procedure complications, and the patient was discharged home in a stable condition soon after completion of the neurolysis. Of note, the patient was using oxycodone 5 mg oral tablets three times per day as needed for pain since his cancer diagnosis. In the last three weeks prior to the procedure, he did not complain of nausea or constipation. He also denied taking the medication more frequently than usual.
In the emergency department, vital signs demonstrated blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2℃. Abdominal exam was significant for minimal epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The remainder of the physical exam was noncontributory. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell (WBC) of 10.0 × 103/µL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 295 × 103/µL. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 5.1 mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL, glucose of 384 mg/dL, and anion gap of 9 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed aspartate transaminase (AST) of 12 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 17 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 74 U/L, and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL. Lipase was within reference range at 5.0 U/L. Urinalysis did not reveal ketones. Hemoglobin A1c was unremarkable at 5.4% and glucose levels normalized without treatment, suggesting that the initial hyperglycemia was probably related to stress.
The patient initially received intravenous fluids and was placed on a bowel rest regimen. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed significant gastric distension, which was concerning for obstruction at the level of the duodenum (Figure ).
Next, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed large amounts of fluids within the gastric fundus and body, which was also concerning for duodenal obstruction. The examined first and second parts of the duodenum were normal (Figure ).
As a result, upper gastrointestinal series with barium swallow was performed to look for an obstruction distal to the second part of the duodenum. Although it showed delayed gastric emptying of the contrast, contrast was seen in the third part of the duodenum and jejunum ruling out a complete obstruction in the duodenum (Figure ).
Finally, a push enteroscopy was performed to visualize the entire duodenum. It showed angulation in the third part of the duodenum but no obstruction or mucosal abnormalities in the third or fourth parts of the duodenum (Figure ).
At that point, extensive gastrointestinal workup ruled out small bowel obstruction, and the diagnosis of ileus was made. The patient received ondansetron and polyethylene glycol as needed, and his diet was advanced slowly. His symptoms improved over the course of a few days, and he experienced a return of normal bowel activity. He eventually tolerated a regular diet and was discharged home in a stable condition.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [37.2, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [82.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [15.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [10000.0, 'µL']}",2,2,2,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 82.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 10000.0 count/µL. To convert 10000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 10000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 10000000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 15.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2."
3750,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7196934-1,Extracted,"A 45-year old male bus driver represented to our clinic with a one-week history of persistent left shoulder pain, which had now spread to his left upper back. He also felt feverish and had reduced appetite. He first saw a colleague four days prior with just left shoulder pain. Shoulder examination then revealed a normal-looking joint with no redness, swelling or tenderness. There was a slight pain on abduction and external rotation. There were post-inflammatory depigmented scars seen on the upper back area which were not hot or tender. He was treated symptomatically with simple analgesics and advised to return if the symptoms persisted or increased.
On the latest presentation, his left shoulder pain was dull in nature and was rated at 5 over 10 in severity. He had no associated numbness or pins and needle around the area of concern. Mefenamic acid tablets provided some relief. He had been working continuously for the preceding week. However, he could not recall any history of heavy lifting, trauma, cuts or bites to the area. There was no constitutional symptom, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
He was on metformin and gliclazide for type 2 diabetes mellitus, perindopril and amlodipine for hypertension, and simvastatin for dyslipidemia. The most recent glycated hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) level from two months ago was 8.1%.
Clinically, he was alert, oriented and non-toxic looking. His temperature was 37.6°C, oxygen saturation was 98% on air, blood pressure was 122/72 mmHg, and pulse rate was 90 beats per minute. His height and weight were 173 cm and 115.8 kg respectively making his body mass index (BMI) 39 kg/m². Capillary blood glucose was 17.2 mmol/L.
Upon removing his shirt for full shoulder examination, a purplish swelling located on the midline to the left upper back was noticed. It was warm, firm and mildly tender on palpation. There was a punctum seen (). Examination of the left shoulder revealed a normal-looking joint, which was not red, hot or tender on palpation. However, its range of movements were slightly limited secondary to pain from his upper back.
Given his history of poor glycemic control and mild fever, initial blood tests were sent urgently. These showed a white cell count (WCC) of 35.00 (normal 4.00-10.00 x10³/uL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 97 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 382.3 mg/L, sodium of 130 (normal 136-145 mmol/L) and venous blood pH 7.44.
The provisional diagnosis of an upper back carbuncle, on a background of poorly controlled diabetes was made. His case was discussed with the general surgeon on duty who agreed to admit the patient for further management. He was commenced on intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam 3g QID, intravenous fluid and adequate analgesia. Intravenous insulin infusion was initiated to control his blood glucose level.
Ultrasonographic evaluation at the area of concern showed a collection at the subcutaneous tissue, however the depth and extent of it could not be determined due to its large size and the presence of acoustic shadowing from the air within the collection. A contrast-enhanced CT thorax was obtained for further evaluation. This showed features suspicious for necrotizing fasciitis due to presence of extensive soft tissue gas within the fascial layer at the region of the upper back, with associated non-enhanced fascial thickening, fat stranding and overlying skin thickening ().
Incision and drainage with wound debridement was performed by the surgical team. Intraoperatively, necrotizing fasciitis of the left upper back extending to the midline was confirmed along with an infected sebaceous cyst measuring 2x2 cm.
Postoperatively, the patient’s antibiotics was escalated to intravenous meropenem 1g TDS along with optimal analgesia. Tissue, pus and blood culture sent subsequently showed no growth. Acid fast bacilli were also not seen on the sent tissue specimen. The patient had no postoperative complications, had good wound healing and was fit for discharge a week after his surgery. His gliclazide was substituted with dapagliflozin, and he was commenced on a basal-bolus insulin regimen. He will continue to see an endocrinologist for his diabetic care. At the time of writing, he remained well and continued to attend his wound care appointments.

The patient had undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting 10 years ago.
While being on routine outpatient follow-up due to suddenly worsening heart failure, with signs of systemic edema resulting in dyspnea, extreme fatigue and hypotension, the patient was categorized to have Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) II effort capacity. Further need for serious inotropic support placed the patient in the 'bridge to transplant', status Ib category. Consequently, the patient was implanted with a centrifugal type flow LVAD (Heartmate III, St. Jude Medical, Abbott) and was started on anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin sodium 6000 IU subcutaneously twice daily (Figure ).
At post-operative day 20, he presented with melena accompanied with haemoglobin (Hb) levels falling from 11 to 6.4 g/dL, which prompted an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealing gastric cancer located at the cardia starting 1.5 cm distal to the Z-line, protruding into the gastric lumen at the posterior wall. Due to the patient's high-risk cardiovascular condition, enoxaparin was maintained at the therapeutic level twice daily at 6000 IU.
Biopsy indicated a signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma which with subsequent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) demonstrated no distant organ metastasis (Figure ).
After necessary preoperative assessment by anaesthesiologists and cardiologists, and under full therapeutic anticoagulation protocol (enoxaparin sodium 6000 IU twice daily), it was decided to proceed with a proximal gastric resection due to potentially life-threatening upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Since the LVAD was implanted at the left upper quadrant, an upper midline incision was found feasible, and proximal gastrectomy with extended D1 dissection was then performed. We performed resection of the proximal stomach using linear staplers, with a consecutive application of end-to-end circular 28 mm stapler for end-to-side esophagogastrostomy performed on the anterior surface of the stomach. Choice of this particular technique was justified due to the significantly shorter duration (20 minutes for resection-dissection-anastomosis) of the procedure in the light of having a shorter suture row on fundus and one anastomosis to deal with instead of three separate suture rows/anastomoses for Roux-en-Y reconstruction after total gastrectomy.
The pathology report indicated a poorly differentiated pT3N2(10/15)M0 signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins. Originating from esophagogastric junction tumor was revealed to have perineural and lymphovascular invasion.
The early postoperative period was without major complications. The intravenous fluid administration was restricted in order to limit systemic edema. Since no postoperative bleeding occurred, there was no need to adjust the anticoagulation regimen.

The patient was diagnosed and treated for lower extremity cellulitis. Due to pain of his lower extremities with ambulation, the patient requested an indwelling urinary catheter. Therefore, urinary catheter placement was performed on the patient's request. Prior to discharge to the skilled nursing facility, discontinuation of the indwelling urinary catheter was recommended multiple times to the patient, but he refused the catheter's removal. He was discharged to the skilled nursing facility after having completed his antibiotic course. He was to continue furosemide, gabapentin, and also nystatin cream for prophylactic prevention of fungal infection on his feet bilaterally.
Nearly three weeks after discharge to the skilled nursing facility, the patient was brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services due to signs of a possible stroke observed at the facility. He was demonstrating dysarthria, right-sided facial droop, and right-sided weakness. These symptoms were first noted about 2.5 hours prior to arrival. Computed tomography head showed no acute abnormality. The patient was not a candidate for alteplase due to an elevated INR.
Initial emergency department vitals showed a temperature of 38.3. After blood cultures were drawn, a single dose of one gram of ceftriaxone was given to the patient. Later that day, the patient's antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and cefepime. On his physical exam, the patient's speech remained dysarthric, and he also exhibited a right-sided facial droop with right-sided weakness. The indwelling urinary catheter from his previous admission was still in place. His labs were remarkable for a creatinine level of 3.50, a blood urea nitrogen of 105, a potassium level of 5.2, and a serum bicarbonate of 17. His white blood cell count was within normal limits. Computed tomography angiography of the head and neck vessels was performed in the emergency department even with his acute on chronic kidney injury with a creatinine of 3.50. The computed tomography scans revealed a 50% to 70% stenosis of the left carotid artery and a less than 50% stenosis of the right carotid artery at the bifurcation. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain the following day, which revealed no signs of an acute stroke.
Upon returning to his hospital room after his magnetic resonance imaging scan, the patient was observed to be unresponsive with no palpable pulses. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. Once return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, the follow-up electrocardiogram did not reveal any ST-segment or T-wave changes concerning for ischemia or infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study revealed an ejection fraction estimated at 50% to 55% without any wall motion abnormalities and a negative bubble study. Alarmingly, the echocardiogram reported “a possible vegetation attached to the tricuspid valve with a separate possible vegetation attached to the Eustachian valve.” It also reported mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
At this time, the patient's blood cultures returned positive for fungal growth. Urine cultures were drawn following the blood culture results, and those cultures also demonstrated fungal growth. The patient's blood and urine cultures were finalized as Candida lusitaniae, and the patient continued on micafungin 150 mg daily. As this organism is highly uncommon, multiple blood cultures were drawn. However, on 3 different days, the blood cultures resulted positive for C. lusitaniae.
As the days progressed, the patient displayed findings consistent with an anoxic brain injury. Therefore, the decision was made with the family to withdraw care, and the patient expired soon after.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [77, 'years'], 'creatinine': [3.5, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",17.239,16.377,18.101,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 77 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 3.5 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (3.5/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**77 * 1.0 = 17.239.

Her height and weight were 155 cm and 39.5 kg, respectively, and her body mass index
was at the 20th percentile for age and sex. Her vital signs were within normal
limits, her blood pressure was not elevated, and she was well-appearing. Her
screening lipid panel was within normal limits (cholesterol 125 mg/dL, high-density
lipoprotein 49 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 63 mg/dL, and triglycerides 68 mg/dL).
Point-of-care screening HgbA1C was significant for a value of 8.5% with a repeat
value of 8.7%. The endocrinology team was consulted by phone and the patient denied
symptoms of weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, and polyphagia; however, a
strong family history of diabetes was reported ().
In the setting of a new diagnosis of diabetes, she was referred to the Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center Emergency Department for further evaluation and
management. On evaluation in the emergency department additional laboratory studies
were sent to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes and evaluate its etiology. Laboratory
studies included a repeat serum HgbA1C, electrolytes, urinalysis, and an islet cell
autoantibody screen. Additionally, routine new-onset diabetes screening laboratory
tests, which included a thyroid stimulating hormone, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and
tissue transglutaminase IgA, were also sent. On laboratory evaluation, she had no
evidence of acidosis or urine ketones and a random serum glucose was within normal
limits (111 mg/dL) but with glycosuria. In the setting of a normal random serum
glucose and absence of acidosis in a well-appearing patient, she was discharged home
with the plan for close endocrine follow-up.
The repeat serum HgbA1C resulted after the patient was discharged and was elevated at
10.3% and her islet cell autoantibody screen and all other screening labs returned
as negative. On telephone follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and a family
history obtained was significant for diabetes spanning 4 generations (see for pedigree). To
further confirm a diagnosis of new-onset diabetes an oral glucose tolerance test was
performed. Fasting glucose (89 mg/dL) and insulin (3.8 µIU/mL) were both within
normal limits. However, her oral glucose tolerance test results were consistent with
the diagnosis of diabetes, with glucose elevation to 313 mg/dL at 2 hours. In the
setting of new-onset diabetes, a negative islet cell autoantibody screen and a
family history of autosomal dominant diabetes, a diagnosis of MODY was suspected.
Confirmatory gene sequencing was sent and revealed a heterozygous mutation in HNF4A

Few days into the hospital stay, he suddenly became short of breath and unwell with severe hypoxemia, hypotension and tachycardia. His peripheral oxygen saturations dropped to 85% on room air. His systolic blood pressure was 60 mmHg with heart rate of 120 per minute. After initial stabilization, urgent computerised tomography scan of the chest was performed that revealed filling defects in the distal main pulmonary artery extending bilaterally up to the interlobar and its segmental branches, consistent with thrombi (, top left). It also revealed dilated pulmonary trunk (24 mm) with a filling defect in the right atrium (, top right). A trans-thoracic echocardiography was immediately performed to assess the right atrial mass. It showed a free-floating thrombus in the right atrium (RA) with a ‘snake-like’ configuration (, bottom panel).

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 114.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 12.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 12.6 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 12.6 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 12.6 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 12.6 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 12.6 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (114.0 mEq/L + 12.6 mEq/L) = 14.4 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.4 mEq/L.
Plugging in 14.4 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.4 - 12 = 2.4 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.4 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 2.4 mEq/L / 11.4 mEq/L = 0.211. The patient's delta ratio is 0.211."

At admission, the clinical evaluation revealed a collaborative, suffering, lean and hypotensive woman (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, last reported body weight 55 kg, height 175 cm), with normal heart rate (76 bpm, rhythmic), who was severely asthaenic. She looked dehydrated and her skin was diffusely hyperpigmented with hypertrichosis.
She denied any major problem in her past clinical history. The recent clinical history was also uneventful, except for an episode of gastroenteritis, about 10 days previously, after which she slowly improved for a few days, followed by the progressive development of the presenting complaints. Renal ultrasounds, performed in the emergency room, revealed kidneys of normal size, without signs of obstruction. Chest X-ray was normal. The patient was oligoanuric; she reported decreasing urinary output in the last few days and catheterization yielded <50 mL of urine. The EKG is shown in .
No previous blood test was available and the patient recalled having performed the last ones a few years before, when, on the occassion of the death of her father, she had undergone a general evaluation for having lost ‘considerable weight’.
The first blood tests performed in the emergency room revealed: serum creatinine, 5.55 mg/dL, active inflammatory signs [C-reactive protein, 41.2 mg/dL (normal < 0.8 mg/dL); fibrinogen, 938 mg/dL], massive leukocytosis (WBC, 67 000), suggestive of both severe haemoconcentration and infection, with severe sodium and potassium imbalance (Na, 107 mmol/L; K, 1.61 mmol/L), moderate, compensated metabolic acidosis (pH, 7.34; HCO3, 19.4 mmol/L; base excess, −4 mmol/L) and moderate hyperglycaemia (160 mg/dL). Haemoglobin level (15 g/dL) was normal. Elevated levels of creatinine–phosphokinase (26 186 UI/L) indicated concomitant rhabdomyolysis, probably as a result of infection and severe electrolyte imbalance, potentially contributing to the acute renal failure.
In the face of the complex metabolic disorder, a hierarchy of interventions was defined, starting from potassium supplementation with very slow sodium infusion, aimed at raising the sodium level by no more than 10–12 mEq/day. As it will be further discussed, the working diagnostic hypotheses are of an acute renal failure superimposed on a chronic kidney disease in the context of diuretic abuse. In spite of the need for rapid correction of the potassium and sodium levels, each of the interventions has, however, important limits and drawbacks and the anuric status limits the use of the most widely employed formulae guiding assessment and therapy in severe sodium imbalance ()
About 12 h after admission, in the absence of cognitive deficits, she suddenly developed flaccid tetraplegia and restrictive respiratory failure. A prompt transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required because of respiratory failure. She was sedated and mechanical ventilation was started.
At transfer to the ICU and immediately after intubation (pO2, 193 mmHg; pCO2, 35.4 mmHg), the major electrolyte levels were the following: Na, 114 mmol/L; K, 0.8 mmol/L; HCO3, 15 mmol/L; lactate, 0.8 mmol/L; chloride, 83 mmol/L; ionized calcium, 1.16 mmol/L; pH, 7.255; base excess, −12 mmol/L; anion gap, 17 mmol/L. Calculated osmolarity was 278 mOsm/kg (according to the simplified formula: Osmolality = Sodium × 2 + Glucose/18 + BUN/2.8), the effect of the low sodium being partly counterbalanced by the high BUN (BUN, 116 mg/dL).
On account of the recent gastrointestinal viral disease, the flaccid paralysis with intact sensorium and the rapid course, the neurologist suspected Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and performed a lumbar puncture, leading to a picture of albuminocytological dissociation (WBC, 7 mm3; proteins, 63 mg/dL; glucose, 90 mg/dL). In parallel with the slow correction of the electrolyte imbalance (), leading also to slow volume repletion, high-dose immunoglobulins were started (0.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days), with prompt clinical improvement and discharge from the ICU 7 days later, to be transferred to the internal medicine ward.
Diuresis gradually restarted in the following 12 h, reaching 800 mL by the second day. In keeping with the hypothesis of chronic kidney disease with impaired concentration ability, urinalysis showed low urine specific gravity (1010) and relatively high spot urinary sodium (39 mEq/L, with serum sodium, 121 mEq/L).
At discharge from the internal medicine ward 2 weeks later, serum creatinine was 1.38 mg/dL, BUN 16 mg/dL, creatinine clearance (24-h urine collection) ranged from 50 to 60 mL/min, proteinuria ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 g/day, Na 141 mmol/L, K 4.5 mmol/L, HCO3 24 mEq/L and PCR 0.04; urinalysis was normal. Renal ultrasounds revealed a decreased corticomedullary differentiation and slightly decreased thickness of the renal cortex, in keeping with the presence of chronic parenchymal disease; the presence of markedly hyperechogenic papillae is suggestive of nephrocalcinosis.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She denied any history of tuberculosis infection. Her current medication was manidipine hydrochloride (10 mg/day) and furosemide (20 mg/day). Physical examination revealed fever, fine crepitation in both lungs and multiple discrete small pustules on her face, trunk and extremities (fig. ). Laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dl, a white cell count of 21,060/mm3 with 91.2% neutrophils, and a platelet count of 210,000/mm3. An anti-HIV test was negative. Radiography of the chest revealed diffuse reticulonodular infiltration of both lungs. Sputum examination was positive for acid-fast bacilli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Skin scrapings from pustules of the right thigh were positive for acid-fast bacilli and M. tuberculosis complex DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction. She was diagnosed with pulmonary and cutaneous miliary tuberculosis. Blood cultures identified M. tuberculosis complex 50 days later. She was started on an initial therapy of isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampicin (450 mg/day), ethambutol (800 mg/day) and pyrazinamide (1,500 mg/day).

3147,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-6485830-1,Extracted,"Our patient is a 54-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and very severe obesity (BMI 48 kg/m2). She underwent laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery in the year 2012. Results were non-satisfactory in terms of weight loss with a difference of 6 kg/m2 in BMI post-procedure. So after six years, she underwent a laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch. She had an uneventful postoperative recovery period. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) study contrast post-procedure did not reveal any evidence of obstruction or leak. The patient was discharged home two days after the procedure. A few days later, she started experiencing three episodes of nausea with brown-colored vomitus. She was found to be septic, with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and temperature of 100.2oF. Her white blood cells count was 12/mm3.The source of infection was presumed to be intraabdominal considering her symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed mildly dilated proximal small bowel loops. The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenous (IV) daily and metronidazole 500 mg IV every eight hours. Symptoms did not improve, so she was taken back to the operating room for diagnostic laparoscopy. Partial small bowel obstruction was noted along with ischemia of a segment of the ileum that was part of the duodenoileostomy due to mesenteric dissection. She underwent an open revision of the small bowel anastomosis with resection and anastomosis for the obstruction revision of the duodenoileostomy. Her hospital stay post-surgery remained uneventful. Diet was advanced gradually throughout the hospital course and a week later, the patient was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Three weeks after that procedure, she noticed a productive cough with thick, yellow, foul-smelling phlegm and shortness of breath. She saw her primary care physician. A chest X-ray performed showed a right lung infiltrate with a right-sided pleural effusion. She was started on treatment with augmentin 500 mg/125 mg every eight hours. Her symptoms became worse so she came to the emergency room. Her vitals showed blood pressure 129/79 mmHg, heart rate 86 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and temperature 98.6oF. Pulse oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Mild leukocytosis was evident (white blood cells count 11.4/mm3 with no bands or left shift). A chest CT showed loculated, right-sided hydropneumothorax with almost total collapse of the right lung (Figure ).
There was a fistulous connection evident, extending from the surgical anastomosis in the stomach/bowel in the right upper quadrant through the right hemidiaphragm to the right hemithorax. These CT scan findings were new as compared to a CT scan obtained for this patient six months prior to the duodenal switch when she presented to the emergency department for non-specific left-sided chest pain. To analyze the anatomy of the fistula further, an upper gastrointestinal fluoroscopic contrast study was performed that showed a large fistula from the distal stomach prior to the duodenal bulb opening to the right pleural cavity (Figure ).
Consultations from gastroenterology and cardiothoracic surgery teams were obtained. Chest tube drains were placed with the plan of eventually performing a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical decortication. Post-procedure CT showed patent chest tubes draining the right pleural cavity. The drained fluid was exudative in nature as per Light’s criteria (fluid lactate dehydrogenase > 12,000 u/L and total protein ratio = 0.7) and culture from the right lung empyema grew Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. An infectious disease consultation was placed at this time. The patient was started on levofloxacin 750 mg IV daily for two weeks as per the sensitivity result obtained for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Micafungin 100 mg IV daily was started for the infection with Candida albicans. This was later switched to Diflucan 400 mg IV daily for a total of two weeks. Repeat cultures from the draining fluid were negative toward the end of the second week.
For treatment of the fistula, the patient was transferred to another facility for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and possible clipping of the fistula due to the unavailability of that particular service in our hospital. As a result, there was a delay of 16 days from admission to the treatment of the fistula. When the EGD was performed, it showed that there was no anastomotic leak from the previous surgery. No evidence of any stricture was identified at the previous anastomosis. A small fistulous tract was noted in the distal part of the antrum likely secondary to ulcer formation that was noted in very close proximation to the fistula tract. An endoscopic clipping was performed. A post-procedure contrast study performed on the same day revealed complete closure of the fistulous opening. The patient was transferred back to our facility after the procedure. An upper GI contrast study performed two days later showed residual leakage from the distal stomach to the right upper quadrant. A repeat EGD was performed along with fulguration of a fistulous opening with argon beam coagulation and repeat orthoscopic clip application with complete obliteration of the fistula tract. This was confirmed by an upper gastrointestinal contrast study showing no persistent fistulous communication between the post-bulbar duodenum and pleural space (Figure ).
After confirmation of fistula obliteration, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed followed by the washout of the right pleural space with the placement of a right-sided chest tube. The patient was discharged home after the procedure and has been followed by multidisciplinary teams on an outpatient basis.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [86.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': True, 'Hemoptysis': True, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': True, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': True}",5.5,5.5,5.5,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

The patient was known to have benign prostatic hyperplasia (on Tamsulosin) and had a long- standing history of anaemia. No palpable abdominal mass was detected during the physical examination. His laboratory evaluation revealed anaemia (haemoglobin: 8.5 mg/dl, MCV: 80 fl, MCH 24.8 pg, MCHC 30.9 gm/dl, WBC 14 × 103/microliter, creatinine 90 micromole/dl, and platelet 156 ng/ml).
Ultrasound of the renal system showed a right renal mass. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative 4 cm renal mass in the mid to lower pole region of the right kidney, involving the renal parenchyma, renal hilum, and the renal pelvis (). Similar findings were also noted on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which also revealed a tumour thrombus extending along the entire course of the right renal vein and projecting into the right side of the lumen of the inferior vena cava ().
A right laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with thrombectomy of the inferior vena cava was performed. The right kidney was enlarged, solid, and adherent to perirenal adipose tissue. The middle and lower part of right ureter were dilated. The thrombus was gently milked from the inferior vena cava and removed separately.
Gross examination of the nephrectomy specimen showed a 5.5 × 4.5 × 4.5 cm greyish tan friable mass arising in the renal pelvis, projecting into the proximal ureter, and extensively infiltrating the adjacent renal parenchyma ().
Histological examination revealed a high grade urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid differentiation. The tumour was arising in the renal pelvis with infiltration of the renal parenchyma and extension into renal sinus and the renal vein. Carcinoma in situ involving the adjacent urothelium was noted ().
The sarcomatoid elements were composed of spindle shaped cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism and high mitotic activity (Figures and ).
Extensive areas of tumour necrosis were also seen. The resection margin of the ureter was free of tumour. The tumour thrombus from the inferior vena cava was composed of high grade urothelial carcinoma along with the sarcomatoid component ().
On immunohistochemistry the carcinoma component was positive for CK7, CK20, p63, p53, and GATA-3, while the sarcomatous component stained strongly and diffusely positive for vimentin.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 90.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 90.0 µmol. To convert 90.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 90.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 9e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 9e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.01 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.01 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.01 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 10.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 10.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 90.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.0 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.0/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**70 * 1.0 = 80.967.

His medical history included hypertension, stage IV chronic kidney disease and benign prostatic hypertrophy. There was no family history of MH, and he had not been anesthetized previously.
Preoperatively, the patient had recurrent hematuria and a laboratory test revealed a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 4.2 g/dl. The patient received transfusion of 2 pints packed red blood cells, and the Hb concentration increased to 6.8 g/dl. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg was injected intramuscularly as a premedication. In the operating room, an electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure measurement, and pulse oximetry were performed, and the bispectral index (BIS VISTA®, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Norwood, MA, USA) sensor was attached onto his forehead. The patient was preoxygenated for 2 minutes, and anesthesia was induced using 120 mg of 1% propofol and 12 mg cisatracurium. After intubation, anesthesia was maintained using desflurane in a total fresh gas flow of 3 L/min of an air/oxygen mixture via an active humidified circuit with a heated wire in the inspiratory limb. In addition, effect-site target-controlled infusion of remifentanil was adjusted between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml. After consultation with the surgeon for considering the possibility of a radical cystectomy, catheters were placed in the right radial artery and right internal jugular vein as a precaution.
Baseline measurements at onset of surgery were oxygen saturation (SpO2) 99%, arterial blood pressure (ABP) 115/50 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 90 bpm, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) 37 mmHg, and esophageal temperature 36.5℃. Approximately 120 minutes after anesthesia induction, ABP was not checked. On inspection, right arm rigidity and lower extremity rigidity were detected. Then cannulation of the right brachial artery was performed. At that time, his ABP dropped to 95/45 mmHg and ETCO2 rose to 54 mmHg. Repeated bolus injections of phenylephrine had a short duration, and hence a continuous infusion of norepinephrine was administered (0.05 µg/kg/min). The esophageal temperature was maintained at 36.2℃. We proceeded with manual hyperventilation to increase minute ventilation (MV) from 6.2 to 8.4 L/min; however, ETCO2 remained above 60 mmHg. Bilateral breath sounds were clear without wheezing and the peak airway pressure remained unchanged. At this point, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.032, PaO2 108.1 mmHg, PaCO2 73.1 mmHg and base excess (BE) −10.8 mmol/L. (). Therefore, we administered sodium bicarbonate 60 mEq. The esophageal temperature increased gradually to 38.6℃. The clinical condition of the patient was suspected to be due to MH, and hence the operation was stopped and dantrolene sodium was prepared. One hundred and fifty minutes after induction of anesthesia, hypotension still persisted and the HR gradually rose to 120 bpm. Next, a continuous vasopressin infusion was initiated and both the breathing circuit and soda lime canister were changed. In spite of increasing MV to 14.5 L/min, the retention of CO2 intensified, and so the ventilator was replaced. In addition, desflurane was discontinued and it was washed out with 100% O2 in 18 L/min fresh gas over a period of 10 minutes. At the same time, anesthesia was switched to 2% propofol (Fresofol 2%™, Fresenius Kabi, Granz, Austria) and the ventilator was replaced with continuous manual hyperventilation. To cool off the patient, ice packs were placed on the head and chest areas and cold saline irrigation was administered through the Foley catheter and the Levin tube. The ETCO2 rose to more than 80 mmHg and the SpO2 gradually decreased to 94%. At this point, the esophageal temperature was 41.7℃ and ABGA showed pH 7.039, PaO2 150.8 mmHg, PaCO2 90.9 mmHg and BE −6.2 mmol/L. Also, serum potassium and lactic acid levels were 7.37 mmol/L and 11.7 mmol/L, respectively. We administered 10 mg furosemide and a regular insulin infusion (10 IU/h). Despite administration of norepinephrine and vasopressin, his ABP dropped rapidly to 42/23 mmHg. Epinephrine 100 and 300 µg was then injected intravenously in a sequence. Dantrolene sodium arrived in the operating room and it was reconstituted with sterile water as quickly as possible and administered through the central venous line. The esophageal temperature at this point was 40.5℃, but within the first 1–2 minutes following 60 mg dantrolene sodium, a rapid decrease in the esophageal temperature to 38.5℃ and a drop in ETCO2 to 32 mmHg were noted. However, at this time, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest with asystole. Then, the infusion of dantrolene sodium was stopped and CPR was initiated immediately following chest compression and epinephrine injection. After 15 seconds of CPR, ventricular fibrillation occurred and the patient's cardiac rhythm converted back to sinus rhythm after a single defibrillation at 200 J. Boluses of epinephrine 1 mg were injected 3 times. Despite infusion of epinephrine and vasopressin, the patient's ABP did not improve. We made a decision to initiate ECMO for providing hemodynamic support and activated an ECMO team. Peripheral venoarterial ECMO was applied by using a size of 15 French (F) arterial cannula (Biomedicus®, Medtronic, Anaheim, CA, USA) and a size of 21 F venous cannula (Biomedicus®, Medtronic, Anaheim, CA, USA) into the right femoral artery and vein, respectively. The initial blood flow rate was 3.5 L/min and the sweep gas-flow rate was 3.0 L/min. The total down time for the first cardiac arrest was 80 minutes until ECMO was ready. After applying ECMO, the patient's ABP improved. The patient was then transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) running an ECMO. No more dantrolene sodium was administered, because the rigidity of the right arm and the lower extremity had resolved, and ETCO2, body temperature and ABGA had improved before the patient was transferred to the SICU. The serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were elevated upon admission (CK 2,413 IU/L) and they continued to be elevated till the following morning (CK 17,779 IU/L). MH clinical grading scale score was 73 (MH rank was 6, ‘Almost certain’). Sixty hours later, the patient was successfully weaned off ECMO. A week later, he was inevitably scheduled for a radical cystectomy with an ileal-conduit due to the remnant bladder tumor, persistent hematuria in spite of arterial embolization and bladder necrosis. For general anesthesia, we performed total intravenous anesthesia using 2% propofol. The patient's vital signs were stable during the operation and the operation was completed uneventfully. After one week, the patient displayed a hemodynamically stable state, was extubated, and then transferred to the general ward.",What is the patient's body surface area?

There was no history of similar complaints in the past or any prior surgery. She denied complaints like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Tingling in hands was not associated with paresthesia in other extremities and sensory or motor deficits. Patient was a known case of multidrug resistant tuberculosis and was being treated with the following drugs for two months: amoxicillin-clavulanate, ethionamide, intramuscular capreomycin, linezolid, and para-aminosalicylate (PAS) granules. Patient was afebrile and her initial vital signs were normal with a pulse of 78/min and blood pressure of 110/76 mm of Hg. On examination, flattening of chest wall on the left side was noted. Trail's sign was positive with a deviation of the trachea to the left side. On auscultation of lung fields, breath sounds were diminished on the left. These findings suggested presence of tuberculous fibrosis in the left lung. No other stigmata of TB were noted and rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Initial blood-work at the time of presentation revealed a low serum calcium level of 6.98 mg/dL. Patient was hospitalized and detailed investigations were done. Coexisting with hypocalcemia, other electrolyte abnormalities noted were as follows: serum sodium of 130 mEq/L, potassium of 1.8 mEq/L, chloride of 95 mEq/L, calcium of 6.98 mg/dL, and magnesium of 0.5 mg/dL. Serum albumin was 4 g/dL. Serum creatinine was normal and remained so throughout the course of hospitalization. The arterial blood gas evaluation showed metabolic alkalosis without respiratory compensation with pH of 7.5, HCO3 of 30 mEq/L, and PaCO2 of 30 mmHg. Routine urine examination revealed a 2–4 pus cells, 1-2 RBCs, and 1-2 epithelial cells, in the absence of proteinuria and glycosuria. Urine calcium/creatinine ratio was 0.49 (>0.2), which confirmed hypercalciuria. Urinary prostaglandin-E level was not performed as this assay is not readily available in our institute.
Vitamin D and serum parathyroid levels were found to be in the normal range, thus ruling out hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism, respectively. Patient was treated symptomatically; injectable calcium, magnesium, and potassium were administered to correct electrolyte abnormalities. Due to the association of aminoglycoside antibiotics with alterations in electrolyte levels, capreomycin was discontinued. Subsequently, the electrolytes started to rise after two days of stopping capreomycin (). Patient was discharged once her symptoms resolved and the serum electrolytes were normalized.

The tumor was attached intimately to the right iliac great vessels and to the right ureter. During the postsurgical period, the girl developed tachypnea with cyanosis, which was not explained by a clear pathophysiology. She was managed by hydration, analgesia, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and supplemental oxygen.
Chest X-ray showed a slightly increased cardiac index. Echocardiography showed just a slight tricuspid regurgitation. Laboratory investigations are shown in . The patient improved within the next 3 days. The pathology result was compatible with mature ganglioneuroma [Figures and ]. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a right sided hydroureteronephrosis, treated by nephrostomy (a second look operation revealed an iatrogenic ureteral injury).
Later, elevated liver function tests were noted, but the subsequent tests were positive for hepatitis C type 1A infection. She had received the peg-interferone/ribavirin regimen with 67,392 copies/ml, and after 6 months of treatment 62,795 copies/ml, therefore the gastroenterologist decided to stop the treatment.
The ROHHAD syndrome diagnosis was built on the following points: The history of rapid weight gain, with hyperphagia concomitant with the discovery of an abdominal ganglioneuroma, the new onset bilateral nonparalytic alternate strabismus, the blunted GH provocative response and the respiratory problems (OSA episodes).
Following the diagnosis, the patient had worsening respiratory symptoms requiring the use of home BiPAP machine. Moreover, later the patient had right nephrectomy due to worsening renal function not responding to nephrostomy tube placement.",What is the patient's body surface area?

5372,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-3558655-1,Extracted,"A 72-year-old woman (145 cm, 47 kg) who was diagnosed with ascending aortic dissection presented for ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement surgery. She visited the emergency department with chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting which started the day before. Her past medical history included common bile duct stone and hypertension that was controlled with an angiotensin receptor blocker. On arrival, her vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 147/100 mmHg and heart rate of 86 beats per minute (bpm). Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness on her epigastric area. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion, while her electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal . A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed Stanford type A aortic dissection that started from the aortic root through the proximal descending aorta that resulted in a large amount of pericardial effusion. Immediate emergent operation was planned, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) could not be performed.
When she arrived in the operating room, electrocardiography, pulse oxymetry and invasive blood pressure monitoring was conducted. Her blood pressure was managed with continuous infusion of nicardipine 2 µg/kg/min, esmolol 100 µg/kg/min, nitroglycerin 2 µg/kg/min, and nitroprusside 0.5 µg/kg/min. The initial vital signs checked in the operating room were stable with blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg and heart rate of 86 bpm. Induction of anesthesia was performed with 7 mg of midazolam, 50 µg of sufentanil, and 10 mg of vecuronium. After the injection of the induction agents, her blood pressure decreased to 76/46 mmHg, and the maximum heart rate noted at the time was 100 bpm. The infusion of the hypotensive agents (nicardipine, esmolol, nitroglycerin and nitroprusside) was discontinued, and subsequently 10 mg of ephedrine, 30 µg of phenylephrine and rapid volume infusion using lactate Ringer's solution were administered. In response to persistent hypotension, 10 mg of ephedrine was administered again, but hypotension was exacerbated resulting in a blood pressure of 66/42 mmHg. After endotracheal intubation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to evaluate cardiac function and to guide the hemodynamic treatment. TEE showed a large amount of pericardial effusion (), septal hypertrophy, severe eccentric mitral regurgitation and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of mitral valve combined with dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (). To improve LVOT obstruction with SAM, 50 mg of esmolol and several 100 µg boluses of phenylephrine , and more rapid volume resuscitation (300 ml of lactate Ringer's solution and 300 ml of hydroxyethyl starch solution) were administered. Afterwards, the patient's blood pressure became stable at 102/56 mmHg and heart rate of 88 bpm. LVOT obstruction with SAM improved, and mitral regurgitation decreased to a mild level. A triple lumen catheter with introducer (Advanced Venous Access®) was placed in the right internal jugular vein and a pulmonary artery catheter was inserted to monitor the central venous and pulmonary artery pressure. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol (1.5-2.5 µg/ml), and remifentanil (8-20 ng/ml) by target controlled infusion system under bispectral index monitoring. Vecuronium was infused continuously (1 µg/kg/min) for muscle relaxation.
Following sternotomy and opening of pericardium, about 200 ml of bloody pericardial effusion was drained for evacuation. After the drainage, residual SAM and mitral regurgitation completely disappeared on TEE. An ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement was conducted under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). While attempting to wean from CPB, SAM with LVOT obstruction reappeared. Esmolol was administered with bolus (50 mg) and continuous infusion (50 µg/kg/min). Afterwards, SAM with LVOT obstruction improved, and patient was weaned from CPB successfully. Postoperative TTE was performed one week after surgery and revealed no evidence of SAM. She was discharged from the hospital 11 days following the operation without major complications.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [47.0, 'kg']}",87.0,82.65,91.35,"The patient's weight is 47.0 kg.

Her son, the primary caregiver, shared that the patient was recently discharged from subacute rehab following a below-knee amputation (BKA) and had been having diarrhea. No further review of systems was obtainable due to her clinical status.
Upon arrival, her blood pressure was 113/48 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% non-rebreather mask, the temperature of 36.6° C. Physical exam revealed an elderly, frail female who was not oriented. She had bilateral coarse rhonchi on auscultation of her lungs with decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. The heart exam was normal. The abdomen was tender to palpation as facial grimacing was noted. A PD catheter was in place, and the site was clean. The patient did not follow commands, but the neurologic exam was non-focal.
Further workup revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 27 mg/dL, creatinine 3.8 mg/dL (at baseline), mild hypokalemia at 3.5 mMol/L, leukocytosis at 13.5/mm3. A stat computed tomography of her head showed no acute intracranial process, and a chest X-ray revealed a right pleural effusion with possible right lower lobe opacities, which were unchanged from the previous studies (Figure ).
She was then started on empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline, and admitted to the intensive care unit for severe sepsis. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended switching cefepime to ceftriaxone as the patient’s mental status continued to deteriorate, in addition to sending peritoneal fluid for analysis and culture. While awaiting PD fluid cultures, her blood cultures grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), leading to concerns for infective endocarditis given her AVR history. The peritoneal fluid analysis revealed neutrophilic predominance with results as follows: 3,938 nucleated cells, 82% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Although receiving empiric antibiotic therapy, the patient’s clinical condition continued to deteriorate. On the fifth hospital day, the patient’s peritoneal fluid culture revealed Enterococcus gallinarum resistant to vancomycin. The patient was subsequently placed on IV daptomycin and cefazolin for synergy with improvement in her mental status within 48 hours. Repeat peritoneal fluid analysis showed decreased leukocytes and clearance of her E. gallinarum on repeated fluid cultures. The susceptibilities for E. gallinarum are listed in Table .
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed as the patient also had persistent MRSA bacteremia, which did not show any vegetations or mass. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) subsequently revealed a large globular deformation of the posterior mitral leaflet bulging into the left atrium, measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm in size that was concerning for mitral valve abscess (Figures -). Unfortunately, due to the patient's worsening clinical status and considering the overall prognosis, the patient was placed in hospice care and died several days later.

4510,20,Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis,severity,integer,pmc-8670145-1,Extracted,"A two and a half years old male with fever was admitted to our hospital on August 2019. He had been diagnosed as pineoblastoma 7 months ago and underwent surgical resection and chemotherapy. He received a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus 4 months ago. He presented with fever (up to 40.4 °C), chills and nausea 2 days before hospital admission. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings except pharyngeal hyperemia and swollen tonsils. His breath and heart sounds were normal. No redness or swelling occurred at the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) site, which had been in indwelled for 6 months, and the catheter was flushed. Computed tomography, urine examination and cerebrospinal fluid were normal. His white blood cell count and C-reaction protein concentration were 17.6 × 109/L (96.3% neutrophils) and 130.5 mg/L (Fig. ). Three sets of blood cultures were collected from peripheral venipuncture at the beginning of the febrile period, then he was treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam. Two of the blood cultures were positive and the pathogens were identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by MALDI-TOF MS (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France). Susceptibility testing showed the organism was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, minocycline, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and ticarcillin/clavulanate. The antibiotic treatment was changed to the combination of cefoperazone/sulbactam and sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim. Then the boy remitted and the body temperature dropped to normal range within 3 days since the treatment was adjusted. The white blood cell counts also returned to normal level and repeated blood cultures (collected from peripheral vein) were negative. However, on the 13th day, his temperature increased again with the highest point of 39.1 °C, and blood specimens were collected from two peripheral veinpuncture sites (left hand and right foot). After 12 h of incubation, gram-negative bacilli were detected from one blood culture, which was collected from right foot. Two types of colonies grew in the blood agar after cultivation, which were identified as S. maltophilia and O. intermedium (strain 045999) by MALDI-TOF MS with 99.9% confidence; however, the Vitek II automated system (bioMérieux) failed to identify strain 045999. Genomic DNA of strain 045999 was prepared using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) and were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the HiSeq X10 Sequencer (Illumina; San Diego, CA, USA). For the whole genome sequence of strain 045999, 5,619,077 reads and 1.69 GB bases were generated (coverage, 400), which were assembled into a 4.9 Mb draft genome contains 82 contigs ≥ 200 bp in length (N50, 454,256 bp) with a 57.71 mol% GC content. ANI between strain 045999 and the type strain LMG 3301T of O. intermedium (ACQA00000000) was determined using the JSpecies []. The ANI value was 97.57%, which was above the cutoff (≥ 95–96% ANI) defining the boundaries of bacterial species [], confirming that the identification was precise. The same organisms were isolated from the other blood culture collected from left hand after 4 days incubation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution with the Vitek II automated system (bioMérieux) and interpreted according to the guidelines for other non-Enterobacterales in CLSI M100 (2019). The strain 045999 was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim, minocycline, tigecycline, cefepime, levofloxacin, meropenem, imipenem (Table ). The strain 045999 formed beige, translucent, shiny and mucoid colonies on blood agar within 24 h of incubation at 35 °C and gram-staining indicated gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria without spores. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the S. maltophilia was consistent with previous results. According to the results of susceptibility test, the S. maltophilia was susceptible to levofloxacin and ceftazidime, and strain 045999 was also susceptible to sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim and levofloxacin. Therefore, cefoperazone/sulbactam was replaced with levofloxacin and ceftazidime, and sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim was continued as before. One week after the treatment, blood cultures were obtained from both peripheral venipuncture and PICC. The blood culture obtained from PICC was positive with the growth of S. maltophilia and O. intermedium whereas the blood obtained from peripheral venipuncture was negative. Meanwhile, the PICC was removed and the culture was negative. Therefore, the therapy mentioned above was continued for 10 days, and the patient discharged after recovery.",What is the patient's Centor Score?,"{'age': [5, 'years'], 'Cough Absent': True, 'Temperature': [40.4, 'degrees celsius'], 'Exudate or swelling on tonsils': True, 'Tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes': False}",4,4,4,"The current Centor score is 0.

Her medical history was notable for chronic atrophic gastritis.
She had a longstanding history of chronic atrophic gastritis in January 2014 with gastroscopy. According to the Kimura/Takemoto classification[], atrophy of the gastric mucosa was classified as C-2. She had received recommended dose of H. pylori eradication therapy twice, once 7 d for omeprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin and once 14 d for pantoprazole + bismuthate + tetracycline + metronidazole. She was followed up with annual gastroscopy and had not taken any PPIs since then. In addition, she had a history of myoma of uterus for more than 40 years, without operation.
On physical examination upon admission, she was 1.54 meters in height and 60 kilogram in weight. She had a blood pressure of 117/68 mmHg with pulse rate of 65 beats per minute. Her jugular venous pressure was not elevated. She had clear lungs and normal heart sounds with no murmurs or gallops on auscultation. There were no other pathognomonic signs during physical examination, except for slight tenderness in the upper abdomen.
After admission, the patient was thoroughly evaluated with routine blood tests, routine urine tests, routine fecal tests and occult blood test, blood biochemistry, and infection indexes. No significant abnormal laboratory results were recorded in this patient.
Gastroscopy revealed a 6 mm submucosal tumor (SMT)-like slightly elevated lesion in the anterior wall of the lower part of the gastric body, which had faint yellow discoloration (Figure ). Atrophy of the gastric mucosa was classified as C-2, yet the local background mucosa of the lesion showed no apparent atrophy, after eradication of H. pylori. No fundus gland polyp (FGP) was found in other sections of the stomach.
A biopsy of the SMT-like lesion was obtained, and histopathological findings showed numerous cells with basophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical nuclei-like chief cells of the fundic gland, which were arranged in irregular branching and anastomosing tubules in a layer of the lamina propria mucosae (Figure ).",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 121.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 89.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 13.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 13.5 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 13.5 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 13.5 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 13.5 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 13.5 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 121.0 mEq/L - (89.0 mEq/L + 13.5 mEq/L) = 18.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 18.5 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 2.6 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 18.5 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.6 (in g/dL)) = 22.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 22.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 22.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 22.0 - 12 = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 10.0 mEq/L."

104,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-6194623-1,Extracted,"A 79-year-old woman initially presented with diabetes in 2008. Her HbA1c level was 8.8%, and treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent was initiated. At that time, the patient also reported swelling on the anterior surface of her neck in the area of the thyroid gland; therefore, she sought consultation at an ambulatory otolaryngology clinic. She was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastasis to the right cervical lymph nodes. In 2011, a pulmonary tumor was detected; it was resected via thoracoscopy and a diagnosis of metastatic thyroid cancer was confirmed. In December 2012, her serum creatinine level was 0.57 mg/dL, with no evidence of proteinuria. In 2013, the patient underwent resection of the right lobe of the thyroid gland, including bilateral dissection of the paratracheal lymph nodes and the right parotid lymph node.
In January 2016, the patient experienced exacerbation of her unresectable thyroid cancer; therefore, oral administration of 10 mg lenvatinib was initiated.
The findings of the pretreatment laboratory assessment were as follows: normal blood pressure (118–132/64–77 mmHg); creatinine (Cr), 0 .72 mg/dL; and albumin (Alb), 3.8 g/dL, respectively, and her estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 mL/min/1.73 m2. In addition, the urine sample test showed negative results for red blood cells (1–4/HPF), and the urine qualitative analysis showed negative results for protein. However, after initiation of treatment (Fig. ), the patient developed hypertension that required treatment with candesartan (8 mg/day). By February 2016, her Cr level had increased to 0.82 mg/dL, and her eGFR and Alb levels had decreased to 51 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 3.5 g/dL, respectively. She also developed hypertension (blood pressure, 140–170/60–70 mmHg). Based on these findings, we added a daily dose of amlodipine (5 mg/day) to her treatment; thereafter, the dose was increased to 10 mg/day. By March 2016, her Cr level continued to increase to 0.84 mg/dL, and her eGFR and Alb level continued to decrease (49 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 3.0 g/dL, respectively). Her blood pressure increased to 150/60 mmHg, and the candesartan dose was increased to 12 mg/day. However, she developed lower limb edema. In April 2016, she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome. Development of generalized edema and weight gain were noted, her Cr level increased to 1.17 mg/dL, and her eGFR decreased to 34 mL/min/1.73 m2. Measurements of other relevant parameters were as follows: total protein (TP), 5.1 mg/dL; Alb, 2.5 mg/dL; total creatinine (TC), 329 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 204 mg/dL; and urinary protein, 11.78 g/gCr. The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment.
On admission, the patient’s medications included lenvatinib (10 mg), glimepiride (0.5 mg), pioglitazone (915 mg), alogliptin (925 mg), candesartan (12 mg), and amlodipine (10 mg). On physical examination, her height was 155 cm, weight was 55 kg (usual weight, 44 kg), body mass index was 21.4 kg/m2, blood pressure was 142/60 mmHg, heart rate was 72 beats/min, temperature was 36.2 °C, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min. A surgical scar from her thyroidectomy was visible on the anterior aspect of her neck. In addition, bilateral edema of her lower limbs was evident. Significant medical history included a uterine myoma, appendicitis, and a fundal hemorrhage due to diabetic retinopathy at the ages of 50, 51, and 77 years, respectively. Her family history was negative, and she had no known allergies. The patient was a non-smoker and only consumed alcohol socially. Her urine and blood laboratory data are summarized in Table . Large quantities of urine protein and urine occult bleeding, anemia, renal function disorder, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia were observed. Urinary Bence-Jones proteins, increased ferritin, hypergammopathy, low-complement blood symptoms, and ANCA and ds-DNA antibodies were not observed, however.
Multiple pulmonary metastases were observable on computed tomography (CT) imaging. Although there was no evidence of malformation of the kidneys, generalized edema and thoraco-abdominal fluid were observed.
Considering the development of elevated blood pressure and nephrotic syndrome after administration of lenvatinib, drug-induced nephrotic syndrome was suspected as the primary clinical diagnosis. Therefore, lenvatinib treatment was discontinued.
The patient’s diabetes was controlled well with the use of oral hypoglycemic agents (HbA1c of 5.7%). However, her blood pressure remained high at 140–145/50–60 mmHg despite treatment with oral antihypertensive agents. Because of her history of diabetic retinal hemorrhage, papillary thyroid carcinoma with relatively new onset of distant metastasis, hematuria, low selectivity index (0.247), information based on the negative findings of hypocomplementemia, absence of MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, ds-DNA antibodies, we thought that minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) would not be correct diagnoses.
Because it is necessary to differentiate FSGS from diabetes nephrosis syndrome and secondary membranous nephropathy due to a malignant tumor, and because most TKIs are type I or type II and lenvatinib has novel binding ability (type V), we performed a renal biopsy.
Renal biopsy using light microscopy (Fig. ) revealed that 7 of 16 glomeruli had complete hyalinization, and that glomeruli with incomplete hyalinization showed partial glomerular collapse (arrow in Fig. ); FSGS was confirmed because the glomeruli showed lobular and segmental expansion. Vacuolar degeneration of the podocytes (see arrow in Fig. ) and enlarged endothelial cells with a thickened loop were evident, suggesting endothelial injury (arrow head in Fig. ). Thrombotic microangiopathy was absent. The mesangial matrix slightly increased, but the mesangial cells did not increase (Fig. ). Periodic acid methenamine silver (PAM) staining showed mesangial interposition-like changes and a duplicated basal membrane (arrow head in Fig. ). The endarterium was slightly thickened and the arterioles showed partial hyaline consolidation.
Immunofluorescence (Fig. ) of the IgG showed nonspecific staining, no linear pattern, and negative results. Only IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 were granular and slightly positive in the mesangial areas, and there was no staining of the loop wall. C1q was negative.
Vacuolar degeneration of podocytes (arrow in Fig. ) was observed on electron microscopy (Fig. ). The loops were thickened and a duplicated basal membrane was observed. Mesangial interposition-like changes were found (arrow in Fig. ), and endothelial cells invaded the basal membrane (arrow head in Fig. ).
Electron-dense deposits suggesting immune complexes were not observed. Foot process effacement was almost 60–70%. It suggested that this is a case of podocytopathy and not a secondary effect of hypertensive/hyperfiltration injury.
The mesangial matrix slightly increased, but there was no nodular glomerulosclerosis such as a Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion or IgG immunofluorescence staining with a linear pattern along the basement membrane, thereby suggesting that the diagnosis was not advanced stage disease that could lead to diabetes nephrosis syndrome. The glomeruli showed lobular expansion, but mesangial cells were not increased and an electron-dense deposit was not observed; therefore, the diagnosis was not MPGN.
With regard to morphologic variants of FSGS based on the Columbia classification, the collapsing variant of FSGS is diagnosed because of the presence of collapsed glomeruli.
Treatment included the discontinuation of lenvatinib, dietary modifications, and the use of palliative diuretics. The patient’s weight decreased over the course of the subsequent 2 weeks (loss of 8.7 kg from admission weight) but showed improvement in the edema of her lower limbs. Glycemic control was achieved. Because nephrotic syndrome was improved after discontinuation of lenvatinib therapy, and because diabetic changes in the kidneys including increased thickness of the mesangial matrix were mild, we confirmed a diagnosis of secondary FSGS caused by lenvatinib.
The patient was discharged on day 11 after admission. Although her renal function status did not improve from that on admission (Cr, 1.16 mg/dL; eGFR, 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) to that at discharge (Cr, 1.17 mg/dL; eGFR, 34 mL/min/1.73 m2), her proteinuria did improve from 11.8 g/day on admission to 5.4 g/day at discharge. She was followed-up on an outpatient basis, and her proteinuria continued to gradually decrease over time. In July 2017, her Cr level was 1.04 mg/dL and eGFR was 39 mL/min/1.73 m2, with complete remission of urinary protein (qualitative urinary protein, 116 mg/gCr) and no evidence of hematuria. A period of 15 months was required to achieve complete remission after discontinuation of lenvatinib treatment. Chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage G3bA1) was diagnosed. Regular follow-up examinations are performed at our outpatient clinic.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [79, 'years'], 'weight': [55.0, 'kg'], 'height': [155.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [1.17, 'mg/dL']}",29.455,27.982,30.928,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 79 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.17 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 155.0 cm, which is 155.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.55 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.55 m * 1.55 m) = 22.893 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.9, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 47.855 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 79) * 47.855 * 0.85) / (1.17 * 72) = 29.455 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 29.455 mL/min."

The owner had received the product from a veterinarian without any further instructions on fasting, so the dog received a handful (30 g) of dry dog food (Bosch Active) about half an hour before the Profender® administration. Two and a half hours after drug application, the dog showed progressive tremor and severe panting. Furthermore, he developed excessive drooling and salivation and became ataxic.
Therefore, the dog was presented at a veterinary clinic immediately. Initial physical examination revealed a rectal temperature of 40.2°C (104.4°F), heart rate of 136/min, red mucous membranes and a normal capillary refill time of 1 s. The dog showed agitated general condition, panting, and generalized tremor, but was able to stand and walk on his own. Results of further neurological examination were unremarkable. As the patient's condition was stable, the treating veterinarian decided to perform no further clinical examinations (e.g., blood or urine analysis) and symptomatic treatment was initiated.
The dog was admitted to the intensive care unit and possible seizure activity, body temperature, and intravenous fluid therapy were monitored closely. An IV catheter (Vasofix® Braunüle®, Braun Melsungen) was placed in the right cephalic vein. The patient obtained an intravenous lipid emulsion (Lipofundin® MCT/LCT 20%, Braun Melsungen) as an IV bolus of 2.0 mL/kg followed by an infusion of 210 mL for the next hour. IV fluid therapy (Sterofundin® Iso, Braun Melsungen) was also administered at a maintenance rate of 10.0 mL/kg for 3 h, followed by 2.0 mL/kg/h until the next day. Additionally, 1.0 mg/kg diazepam (Ziapam®, 5 mg/ml, Ecuphar) was administered IV to treat the generalized tremor. Since no clinical improvements were noted, 0.2 mL acepromazine (Vetranquil® 1%, Ceva) were administered IM. Subsequently, the patient's condition improved and the generalized tremor changed to a slight trembling within an hour. Body temperature normalized after 4 h to 38.1°C (100.6°F).
One day following admission, no abnormalities were detected at the physical examination. The dog was alert, mucous membranes were pink and moist, heart rate was 84/min, the respiratory rate was 24/min, the rectal temperature was 38.6°C (101.5°F), the abdomen was slightly tensed and rectal examination was unremarkable. No defecation was observed during the hospitalization, but appetite and urination were normal. Neurological examination was also unremarkable and the dog was discharged to his owner without further medication. The owner reported that the dog vomited multiple times the week after discharge. Apart from that, the dog's behavior had recovered completely.
Since Australian Shepherds are predisposed to carry the nt230(del4) MDR1 mutation, which is associated with increased susceptibility against several MDR1 reactive drugs, including EMO, MDR1-genotyping was performed (TransMIT GmbH, Giessen, Germany). The dog showed the homozygous mutant MDR1−/− genotype, resulting in a complete loss of MDR1-mediated drug efflux at the blood-brain barrier.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [17.0, 'kg']}",54.0,51.3,56.7,"The patient's weight is 17.0 kg.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 113.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 13.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 13.1 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 13.1 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 13.1 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 13.1 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 13.1 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (113.0 mEq/L + 13.1 mEq/L) = 7.9 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.9 mEq/L.
Plugging in 7.9 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 7.9 - 12 = -4.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -4.1 mEq/L."

He was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of increasing dyspnea for 3 months. His parents managed a workshop in a small town, and he had worked in processing aluminum and brass to make camera parts since he was 18 years old. He did not wear a dust respirator and worked closely to the cutting machine (Fig. ) because of his poor eyesight.
On presentation, the patient was fully conscious with a height of 160 cm, a body weight of 47 kg, body temperature of 36.8 °C and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed fine crackles upon auscultation, especially on the bilateral upper lung areas. Otherwise, there were no abnormal physical findings. Laboratory data demonstrated elevated serum levels of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6; 1631 U/mL) and surfactant protein D (SP-D; 157.3 ng/mL), compared to normal values of < 500 U/mL and < 110 ng/mL, respectively. Antinuclear and autologous antibodies were all negative. Chest X-ray showed linear and reticulonodular shadows with marked bilateral pleural thickening in the upper lung fields (Fig. ). Chest CT indicated bilateral dense sub-pleural consolidation, bronchiectasis and ground glass opacities in the bilateral upper lobes (Fig. ). Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive disorder: vital capacity (VC) of 1.12 L (34.6% of predicted), forced expiratory volume in 1.0 s (FEV1) of 0.99 L (42.5% of predicted), FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) of 74.4% and total lung capacity (TLC) of 2.48 L (47.7% of predicted). The patient was unable to perform the diffusion test correctly. TBLB was performed with bronchoscopy to get tissue samples of the right upper lobe (B2).

The biopsied specimen had fragments of bronchiolar wall with infiltration of lymphocytes in interstitial spaces; unfortunately, it did not contain alveolar tissue. A surgical diagnostic procedure was avoided due to the patient’s critical respiratory condition and instead, elemental analysis was performed on the existing specimen obtained by TBLB. The content of aluminum and other particles were measured in the TBLB sample.
On elemental analysis of the biopsy specimen, a relatively high amount of aluminum was detected in comparison to trace amounts of other elements, including iron and silica (Fig.). Based on the histological findings, the elemental analysis and the occupational history, the case was diagnosed as airway aluminosis. The patient’s condition was progressively getting worse; consequently, home oxygen therapy was implemented and the anti-fibrotic agent pirfenidone was administered.

Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are not reported and so we assume that this is missing from the patient, keeping the current total at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 0 + 3 = 3.
The patient's heart rate is 112.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5.
Because the patient has had an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0.
Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 6.0.
Hemoptysis is reported to be present and so one point is incremented to the score, making the current total 6.0 + 1 = 7.0.
Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 7.0.

2216,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-7713807-1,Extracted,"An 83-year-old man (weight: 65 kg, height: 167 cm) was scheduled to undergo open reduction and internal fixation of a pertrochanteric fracture of the right femur. His past medical history was nonspecific. He had no history of allergy to drugs or food. Preoperative assessment including blood biochemistry, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography showed results within the normal range. Two hours before arriving at the operating room, the patient was administered 1 g of cefotetan sodium (Yamatetan®, Jeilpharm, Korea) intravenously (IV). Preoperative skin test to the Yamatetan® was negative.
Upon arriving at the operating room, the patient was monitored using noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement, electrocardiography, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) equipment. The pre-anesthetic BP, heart rate (HR), and SpO2 values were 172/108 mmHg, 94 beats/min, and 95%, respectively.
Spinal anesthesia was administered in the left lateral decubitus position using hyperbaric bupivacaine (13 mg) and fentanyl (10 μg) while oxygen was supplied at 6 L/min via a facial mask. After 5 min, sensory blockade of T10 was checked. For sedation, 1 mg of IV midazolam was administered. During the 50 min of the spinal anesthesia, that is 25 min after the start of surgery, the systolic blood pressure was between 110 and 120 and pulse rate was maintained in the early 100 s, and these were stable. By then, the patient had received 0.4–0.5 L of crystalloid (plasma solution), the estimated blood loss was about 50 ml, and the urine output was about 1.5 ml/kg/h.
After 25 min from the start of surgery, BP, HR, SpO2 values were 116/72 mmHg, 94 beats/min and 100%, respectively. The HES 130/0.4 (6% Volulyte®, Fresenius Kabi Korea, Korea) infusion was started through a peripheral IV route to replace the expected post-operative bone bleeding and an additional 2 mg of IV midazolam was administered. Five minutes after the administration of 50 ml of HES, the BP suddenly dropped to 84/52 mmHg, and the HR increased to 111 beats/min. SpO2 was reduced to 95%. To restore the BP, 100 μg of IV phenylephrine was administered immediately. Subsequently, the patient exhibited confusion and agitation. For further sedation, 1 mg of midazolam was administered, but the patient did not calm down and tried to move his fixed arms. Skin rash was observed on the face and neck first, which then spread to the entire body. The rechecked BP, HR, and SpO2 after phenylephrine administration, were 84/45 mmHg, 117 beats/min, and 97%, respectively. Additional 100 μg of IV phenylephrine bolus was administered. Immediately, the test for skin sensitivity to Yamatetan® was re-performed, and the result was negative. The patient’s agitation was reduced and the vital signs were maintained after multiple phenylephrine bolus were administered. The surgery was nearing completion; hence, general anesthesia was not considered.
Clinical signs including hypotension, tachycardia, and mild hypoxemia, as well as the appearance of a skin rash were consistent with the clinical criteria for an anaphylactic reaction. Other antibiotics or blood components were not administered during the surgery, and the anaphylactic reaction occurred within 5 min of HES exposure. The infusion of HES was terminated within 10 min, as it was considered the cause of the anaphylactic reaction. Subsequently, 5 mg of IV dexamethasone was administered. The total amount of IV injected phenylephrine was 400 μg. The patient received 1 L of the crystalloid (plasma solution) and 50 ml of the colloid (HES). Estimated blood loss and urine output were 100 ml and 200 ml, respectively. The total anesthesia time was 2 hours and the operation time was 46 min.
In the recovery room, laboratory tests including immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and tryptase assessment were performed. The patient was taken chest X-ray due to observation of mild hypoxemia; however, the radiologist interpreted no unusual findings compared with the preoperative examination. The skin rash on the entire body persisted while the patient stayed in the recovery room; hence, IV dexamethasone 7.5 mg and chlorpheniramine 6 mg were administered along with 800 ml of crystalloid fluid for symptom relief.
The patient was transferred to the general ward with stable vital signs (BP: 111/78 mmHg, HR: 96 beats/min, SpO2: 100%) after close observation in the recovery room for 75 min. The patient’s urine output was sufficient (1–2 ml/kg/h) for 24 h after operation.
The result of the skin test to detect a reaction against HES performed on the next day was negative. Testing of a blood sample drawn in the operating room revealed the presence of 13.9 ng/ml of tryptase (normal range: < 11.4 ng/ml) and 211 IU/ml of total IgE, as determined using paper radioimmunosorbent test (PRIST) (normal range: 0–100 IU/ml).

One year earlier she presented with dyspnea on exertion and mild bilateral lower extremity edema. Her initial EF was 50% by echocardiogram and her left heart catheterization did not show any evidence of coronary artery disease. A month prior to admission she developed progressive dyspnea with exertion and worsening lower extremity edema. At that time she also was found to have an EF of 25% (decreased from 50%) and hyponatremia. Her regimes of diuretics, beta-blocker, and ACEI were further optimized.
On admission, she was found to have borderline blood pressure (103/60 mmHg), and bilateral lower extremity edema. Upon further previous chart review, she had a persistent elevated serum free lambda light chain of about 870–1000 mg/L and faint lambda light chain monoclonal protein on SPEP (54–118 mg/dL) over the last 18 months. At this admission, the white blood cell count was 27.4 × 109/L with 70% lymphocytes (same range as her baseline). The red blood cell count was 3.90 × 1012/L, and the platelet count was 188 × 109/L. She also had worsening hyponatremia (sodium of 123 meq/L, baseline 130–133 meq/L). Creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (baseline 1.0–1.2) and urine analysis was negative for protein.
SPEP and immunofixation analysis revealed lambda free light chain (Bence Jones) proteinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia involving IgG and IgA. Serum free lambda light chain was 724 mg/L, and kappa/lambda ratio was 0.01, indicating overproduction of lambda light chain. UPEP showed a spike in the beta region, 888.7 mg/24h. EKG was low voltage and CXR revealed bilateral small pleural effusion. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed normal left ventricular wall thickness, severe global systolic hypokinesis of the left ventricle, EF 25%, an inter-ventricular diastolic septal thickness of 8.0 mm, moderate right atria dilation and moderate low gradient aortic stenosis.
A right heart catheterization was performed revealing elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RA17 mmHg, PA 55/28 mmHg (mean 38 mmHg), PCW 28 mmHg). Cardiac index was low at 1.53 L/min/m2. Endo-myocardial biopsy showed focal patchy infiltration of the myocardium and fibrous tissue with Congo red stain positive for amyloid ().
Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow that was replaced by nodules of small lymphocytes and patchy sheets of plasma cells. Plasma cells comprise approximately 50% of the cellularity. Immunohistochemistry stains highlighted the plasma cells that were lambda light chain-restricted. Flow cytometry showed 63% monoclonal B-cells that express CD5 and kappa light chain-restricted as well as clonal plasma cells that express lambda light chain, demonstrating that she had two separate clones. A Congo red stain did not show definitive amyloid deposition ().
Patient’s home medications of beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were discontinued. She was treated with furosemide intravenously and her weight decreased to 48.4 kg from 50.5 kg. Patient was maintained on furosemide and spironolactone with plans for chemotherapy. However, she was readmitted for refractory heart failure symptoms requiring inotropic support.

The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 76 years old. The patient's is a Female.
The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly female's, the total body water percentage value is 0.45.
The patient's weight is 48.4 kg. The concentration of sodium is 123.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 123.0 mEq. To convert from 123.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 123.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 123.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 123.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 123.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 123.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.45 * 48.4 * (123.0/140 - 1) = -2.64 L.

9600,67,Albumin Corrected Delta Ratio,lab test,decimal,pmc-3519780-1,Extracted,"A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient’s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.
Though initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.
In the ED, the patient’s temperature was 103.9°F (39.9°C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.
Initial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 × 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0–10.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0–18.0], platelet count of 135 × 103/mm3 [lab range 150–350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137–145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98–107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0–30.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9–20], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7–1.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70–99], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0–10]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0–0.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38–126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13–69), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15–46). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5–10 WBC, 0–5 red blood cells (RBC), 5–10 epithelial cells, 5–10 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.
Due to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40–70], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12–60], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.
A chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure 
). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure 
). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.
Given the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure 
, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure 
. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient’s mental status.
Over the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient’s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient’s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.
On hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [100.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [4.4, 'g/dL'], 'Bicarbonate': [19.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [134.0, 'mmol/L']}",0.4,0.38,0.42,"The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 19.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 19.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 19.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 19.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 19.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 19.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 19.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 4.4 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 15.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.4 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 2.0 mEq/L / 5.0 mEq/L = 0.4. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.4."

She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.",What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [110.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [4.2, 'g/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [6.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [148.0, 'mmol/L']}",40.95,38.903,42.998,"The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).

The concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride.

The concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L."
1331,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-8511279-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old woman visited with fever and pain in the transplant kidney. She had end-stage renal disease due to unknown cause and underwent peritoneal dialysis for 7 years. The patient was diagnosed with azotemia 14 years ago. During her first visit, both her kidneys presented with decreased size (approximately 7.8 cm) and increased echogenecity, and her serum creatinine level was 397.8 μmol/L. Considering these, we diagnosed her with end-stage renal disease and did not perform renal biopsy to confirm any underlying disease. Before dialysis, we performed autoimmune studies, checking for anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double-strand DNA antibodies, C3, C4, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, but all of them showed no evidence of autoimmune disease. In addition, the patient did not present any symptoms or signs associated with coagulopathies; her bleeding time was 1.3 min (reference range: 1–4 min). Six years ago, she underwent kidney transplantation from a deceased donor. After kidney transplantation, she received 5 mg prednisolone, 4 mg tacrolimus, and 1500 mg mycophenolate mofetil as immunosuppressants and 2.5 mg amlodipine for hypertension. Her tacrolimus trough level remained stable between 6.2 and 8.7 nmol/L. There was no rejection history. Her serum creatine level was 71.6 μmol/L, and renal graft function was normal on outpatient examination.
At 6 years after the transplantation, she visited the hospital, complaining of fever and pain in the grafted kidney. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg, and her body temperature was 39.5 °C. She had direct and rebound tenderness over the grafted kidney. The urine output on the first hospital day was only 100 cc/day. She was admitted to intensive care, and her electrocardiogram showed tachycardia with normal sinus rhythm. On admission, laboratory analysis showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 1381 × 109/L, hemoglobin level of 134 g/L, platelet count of 90 × 109/L, and C-reactive protein level of 32.0 mg/dL. Her blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were 10.7 mmol/L and 435.8 μmol/L, respectively. The lactate dehydrogenase level was 607 IU/L (reference range: 150–550 IU/L). Urine microscopy showed 5–10 WBCs/high power field (HPF) and 3–5 red blood cells/HPF. Her tacrolimus level on admission was 6.2 nmol/L. BK virus were determined on admission and the virus titer then was < 100 copies/mL in her urine or whole blood. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4 levels were 1.66 mIU/L (reference range: 0.34–4.25 mIU/L) and 10.35 pmol/L (reference range: 10.3–21.9 pmol/L), respectively. Her basal adrenocorticotropin and cortisol levels were 3.5 pmol/L (reference range: < 26 pmol/L) and 423.7 nmol/L (reference range: 138–690 nmol/L), respectively. Non-enhanced computed tomography was performed immediately after admission and revealed acute pyelonephritis (APN) (Fig. A). In addition, our center performed a multiplex PCR for her using a nasal swab, which is performed for detecting respiratory virus in patients with a septic condition; the PCR kit detects respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human enterovirus, human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and human rhinovirus []. All viruses were not detected in our case.
Based on clinical and laboratory tests, we used ceftriaxone 2 g per day and inotropics for septic shock and APN. On the first hospital day (HD1), she had oliguria (100 cc/day), and we started emergency hemodialysis. We treated her with IVIG (Liv Gamma; SK Chemical Life Science, South Korea) for septic shock (300 mg/kg/day for 3 days). On HD2, her blood pressure stabilized with use of inotropic agents and fluid therapy, and urine output increased to 400 cc/day. However, on the second day (HD3) of IVIG administration, she abruptly developed gross hematuria and urine output decreased to 100 cc/day. At that time, we performed additional laboratory tests to differentiate the other causes of hematuria. Her platelet counts were normal at 174 × 109/L, and prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time also showed normal values of 10.4 s and 34.1 s, respectively. On peripheral blood smear, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia finding was not seen. The patient underwent continuous electrocardiogram monitoring during IVIG infusion; however, there was no evidence of arrythmia. In addition, on HD 3, further heart problem was evaluated using electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without ST-T changes, whereas the echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction decreased to 34%, and a borderline enlarged left ventricle. Echocardiogram also showed abnormalities in the basal to upper middle left ventricular regional wall motion, which is more likely to cause stress induced cardiomyopathy than acute coronary syndrome. Her abnormal echocardiographic findings were considered transient, caused by stress induced cardiomyopathy owing to septic shock.
IVIG treatment was terminated at HD4, but oliguria and gross hematuria persisted. We considered a kidney biopsy to evaluate oliguria and hematuria, but could not proceed because her serious condition. The fever was persisted so the antibiotic was changed to meropenem. On HD 4, vancomycin added due to persistent fever following antibiotic change. On HD7, the fever disappeared, but oliguria persisted. LDH levels on HD 9 and 14 increased to 1704 and 1258 IU/L, respectively, compared to 607 IU/L at the time of admission. Blood and urine cultures were repeatedly performed since she was admitted, but no growths were identified in the two specimens. Her first transfusion was performed due to her low hemoglobin level of 76 g/L at HD 22. On HD 14, we performed conventional kidney sonography, which showed thickening of the renal pelvis and urethral wall; it did not show abnormal focal lesions and hydronephrosis. However, on HD 29, we performed doppler ultrasonography to confirm renal infarction and observed a lack of renal parenchymal and hilar vascular flow (Fig. A). We also performed renal biopsy and reveal that renal infarction with diffuse ischemic changes in the glomeruli but no rejection or other pathology (Fig. B). In addition, we performed SV40 staining using the renal biopsy specimen, and the staining results were negative for SV40. The biopsy specimen did not include medium or large vessels, and arteriolopathies, such as hyalinosis in small arteries or arterioles, were not detected within specimens. After discharge, oliguria and azotemia persisted and she is still on hemodialysis. Follow-up echocardiogram after discharge showed normal wall motion and improved left ventricular ejection fraction (71%). Her bleeding time and autoimmune studies were performed again 2 months after discharge. Her bleeding time was 2 min, and autoimmune studies once again showed negative findings. These results also did not show any evidence of coagulopathies or any autoimmune diseases as underlying comorbidities. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed markedly atrophied transplant kidney after 4 years of renal infarction (Fig. B).",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [80.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [50.0, 'mm hg']}",60.0,57.0,63.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

6374,39,Anion Gap,lab test,decimal,pmc-2876866-1,Extracted,"A 23 year-old female patient, 160 cm tall and 48 kg, was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and admitted for a laparoscopic appendectomy. She had no abnormalities in her pediatric medical history, but from the age 18, she had slowly begun experiencing headaches in her left temporal lobe, nausea, and vomiting. In June of that year, she experienced generalized convulsions and aphasia. In a brain MRI and MRA, an infarction in the posterior divisions of the left mesencephalic arteries was found. Also, in a blood test, an increase in lactic acid was discovered (7.54 mM/L [normal level: 0.5-2.254 mM/L]). The patient was suspected to have MELAS syndrome. She was diagnosed with MELAS after testing (adenosine-to-guanine transition at t-RNA nucleotide 3243 in PCR sequencing). After she turned 21, she was diagnosed with Type I DM. The patient had to orally ingest 200 mg of carbamazepine and 100 mg of aspirin per day and subcutaneously inject 30 units of insulin in the morning and 20 units in the evening. She had no history of total anesthesia.
In a physical examination before the anesthesia, the patient was able to read but had auditory aphasia such that she could not understand spoken words. In the physical examination, there were no signs of hypotonia or amyotrophy of the limbs. The laboratory results showed hyponatremia (126 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (257 mg/dl), and light metabolic acidosis (pH 7.346, PaCO2 36.3 mmHg, HCO3 20.1 mM/L, BE -5.3 mM/L). There were no abnormal findings in the chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. One year prior to her admission to the hospital, she had an ECG that revealed a cardiac index of 67% and no abnormal findings. For sugar control, 4 units of shortacting insulin were injected, and 0.9% normal saline was administered to control hyponatremia. No other pre-operative measures were performed.
After the patient was taken to the operating room, we attached ECG standard leads II, noninvasive monitors for blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, capnogram, and bispectral index (BIS), and a nerve stimulator to the patient using the Multi Channel Anesthesia Monitor S/5™ (Datex-Ohmeda, USA). Preliminary vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 115/65 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats/min, oxygen saturation rate 97%, and the ECG results appeared normal. The patient underwent 3 minutes of denitrogenation with 100% oxygen through a face mask. Afterwards, we administered lidocaine (40 mg) with the Master TCI (Fresenius Vial S.A., France); we then injected 2% propofol (Fresofol®, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) and remifentanil (Ultiva™, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) at target concentrations of 4 µg/ml (Marsh-model) and 5 ng/ml (Minto-model), respectively. After roughly 90 seconds had passed, we checked lid reflexes and found that the patient had lost consciousness. We administered atracurium (0.5 mg/kg), the BIS was 50, and we saw that there was no response to TOF stimulation with the nerve stimulator placed on the ulnar nerve. Endotracheal intubation was then performed without complications. We started mechanical respiration with air (1.5 L/min), oxygen (1.5 L/min), respiratory volume of 450 ml, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. To control ventilation, the capnogram was kept at 35-40 mmHg. We used spirometry to measure the respiratory volume and pulmonary compliance. We started invasive blood pressure monitoring through the radial artery and measured the esophageal temperature with a body temperature monitor. During the operation, we used a forced-air warming blanket (Bair Hugger™, Austine Medical, USA) to stabilize the patient's body temperature. For fluid maintenance, we administered 0.9% normal saline at 200 ml per hour. During the operation, the patient's vitals were kept stable with blood pressure at 120-140/60-80 mmHg, heart rate 80-100 beats/min, oxygen saturation 100%, body temperature 37.0-37.4℃, and BIS 40-60. Thirty minutes after inducing anesthesia, the arterial blood gas study showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 32 mmHg, PaO2 299 mmHg, HCO3 23.3 mM/L, BE -2.1 mM/L; her electrolytes were Na+ 125 mEq/L, K+ 3.8 mEq/L, Cl- 88 mEq/L; and her blood sugar was 176 mg/dl. Twenty minutes prior to the end of the operation, we administered ondansetron (4 mg) to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting. After suturing the peritoneum, we stopped injecting remifentanil, kept the level of propofol in the target effect site at 2 µg/ml, and restored spontaneous breathing. After the operation was over, we stopped injecting propofol and stabilized spontaneous breathing at 300 ml per breath on the spirometer. On the nerve stimulator, the TOF rate was kept at 0.95. To reverse the muscle relaxant effects, we administered glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) and pyridostigmine (15 mg). Afterwards, the patient responded to voice commands and opened her eyes. With stabilized spontaneous breathing, she was extubated. The operation lasted around 1 hour, and during the operation, 350 ml of 0.9% normal saline were used. We then moved the patient to the recovery room and kept her under observation with blood pressure, electrogram, and oxygen saturation monitors. In the recovery room, we gave her oxygen at 5 L/min through the facial mask. The arterial blood gas study showed pH 7.32, PaCO2 43 mmHg, PaO2 219 mmHg, HCO3 21.2 mM/L, and BE -3.6 mM/L; her electrolyte levels were Na+ 128 mEq/L, K+ 4.1 mEq/L, and Cl- 90 mEq/L; and her blood sugar level was 120 mg/dl. We then moved the patient to the ward where we performed a lactic acid test, which measured 3.6 mM/L. Three days after the operation, the patient showed no complications from the operation or anesthesia, so she was released from the hospital.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [90.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [21.2, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [128.0, 'mEq/L']}",16.8,15.96,17.64,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 128.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 90.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.2 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.2 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.2 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.2 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.2 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 128.0 mEq/L - (90.0 mEq/L + 21.2 mEq/L) = 16.8 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 16.8 mEq/L."
3236,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-4400505-1,Extracted,"A 44-year-old Asian man with end-stage renal disease of unknown cause underwent renal transplantation from a deceased donor. The renal allograft had a main superior renal artery and an accessory inferior renal artery. He received immunosuppression with thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. His sCr decreased from 4.7 mg/dL pre-operatively to 2.0 mg/dL throughout the first month. Approximately 4 months post-transplantation, he had an episode of acute allograft dysfunction—sCr increased to 3.8 mg/dL—associated with increased blood pressure requiring an additional anti-hypertensive drug. On physical exam, no bruit was detected overlying the allograft. A CDU demonstrated a 10.5 cm renal allograft with normal echogenicity and two patent main renal arteries both with normal velocities. Evaluation of the intra-renal segmental arteries showed ‘parvus tardus’ waveforms but normal resistive index. A renal allograft biopsy revealed mild acute tubulointerstitial cellular rejection. After treatment with steroids, sCr decreased to 2.2 mg/dL and blood pressure improved. Five months post-transplantation, his blood pressure worsened and sCr rose up to 2.9 mg/dL. A second renal allograft CDU of the superior-pole intra-renal segmental arteries showed parvus tardus waveforms and low-normal resistive index (0.47–0.50). Angle-corrected peak velocities in the main superior renal artery were normal, from 73 to 85 cm/s. The inferior pole resistive index was normal (0.61) without parvus tardus waveform and the corresponding inferior accessory renal artery peak systolic velocity was not elevated (28 cm/s). A kidney allograft biopsy showed patchy mild interstitial inflammation associated with areas of atrophy, but no evidence of segmental or global glomerulosclerosis, glomerulitis, proliferation, necrosis or crescents. Focal intimal sclerosis was observed in the interlobular arteries and mild to moderate arteriolosclerosis was present. A non-contrast magnetic resonance angiography was performed using inversion-recovery pulses to enhance arterial inflow and three-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession acquisition (INHANCE®) [, ]. This imaging study showed focal narrowing of the superior main renal artery 2 cm distal to the anastomosis with mild post-stenotic dilatation (). The inferior accessory artery was grossly normal, but assessment was limited by the small caliber of this vessel. X-ray angiography with CO2 confirmed a 15 mm-long stenosis, 8 mm distal to the anastomosis in the superior main renal artery (). The peak systolic gradient of 100 mmHg was consistent with a very tight stenosis. Angioplasty was performed with excellent angiographic results and no residual pressure gradient. A decision was made not to use a stent due to the difficulty of deployment in the area of stenosis. The inferior accessory artery was normal. A post-angioplasty renal allograft CDU showed improved arterial waveforms and resistive index. The patient was continued on aspirin and clopidogrel was started. The sCr decreased to 1.8 mg/dL and his blood pressure improved. He is currently maintained on low doses of blood pressure medications.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [44, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.8, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male', 'Race': 'Asian'}",41.194,39.134,43.254,"The patient is 44 years old.

The cause of her end-stage renal disease was chronic pyelonephritis. Six weeks prior to her admission, her immunosuppressant regimen was switched from oral cyclosporine (100 mg, twice daily) to oral sirolimus (1 mg, twice daily) with a diagnosis of chronic allograft nephropathy (serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dL). Her mycophenolate mofetil dose was decreased from 2000 to 1000 mg/day and prednisolone was continued with the previous dose (5 mg, daily). Four weeks later, she developed a mild cough, weakness and anorexia. Her condition progressed to a more constant cough and weight loss until she was hospitalized.
Physical examination revealed her blood pressure to be 110/60 mm/Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse rate 92/min and body temperature 38°C. A chest examination revealed fine crackles mainly on her lower lung fields. On admission, the laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 5.1 × 109/L, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit 22.4%, mean corpuscular volume 75 fL (normal range, 77-97 fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 24 pgm (normal range, 26-32 pgm), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 32% (normal, 32-36%), platelet count 213 × 109/L, fasting blood glucose 105 mg/dL, blood urea 62 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase 37 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 45 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 1106 IU/L and total bilirubin 1 mg/dL. A urine analysis was unremarkable.
On the first day of admission, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were discontinued and cyclosporine (200 mg/day) was started. The dose of prednisolone was not altered (5 mg, daily). A chest X-ray showed fine miliary nodules throughout the entire lung fields. Echocardiography revealed normal pericardium and cardiac chambers. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%. An ultrasound examination of her renal allograft did not reveal any pathologic finding. A 6 mm induration was observed on a TB skin test. Sputum and bronchial aspirate examination was positive for acid-fast bacilli, suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan illustrated widespread miliary nodules throughout the lung fields, compatible with miliary TB (Figure ).
In the evening of her fourth day of admission, our patient developed an increasing right lower quadrant abdominal pain spreading to her entire abdomen. Physical examination revealed widespread abdominal tenderness and rebound. An ultrasonographic study of her abdomen disclosed a small fluid collection in the right lower quadrant. Two cysts were detected in her left ovary (54 × 32 mm and 33 × 31 mm). An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast revealed that her pancreas and spleen were normal. Her colonic wall thickness was measured as 4 mm and free fluid was visible in dependent parts of her abdominal cavity. Her peritoneal cavity was then opened with a midline incision and widespread peritonitis was found. Her inflamed appendix (9 × 6 cm) was perforated at its tip. Her ileocecal area and cecum were inflamed with fragile tissues. A cecostomy was performed and a drain was placed. Histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed caseating epithelioid granulomas, epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans giant cells in the sub-mucosa and sub-serosa of her appendix (Figure ). The histological picture, along with positive mycobacterial cultures from the sputum and bronchial aspirate, was suggestive of tuberculous appendicitis.

On examination, his vital signs were as follows: temperature, 101.8 F; blood pressure, 125/76 mmHg; pulse rate, 126/min; and respiratory rate, 24/min. His blood oxygen saturation was 85% at room air and 95% with 5 L oxygen via nasal cannula. His body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 kg/m2. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds with bilateral crackles in the lower part of lung fields and normal first and second heart sounds.
Initial laboratory investigations revealed these results: white blood cell count (WBC), 7700/ul with lymphopenia; prothrombin time (PT), 16.6 seconds; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.4; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 38.5 seconds; D-dimer, 3.85 mcg/mL, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 402 U/L; and C-reactive protein (CRP), 3.63 mg/dl. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.53, paCO2 of 33 mmHg, paO2 of 62 mmHg, serum HCO3− level of 27.6 mmol/L, and alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient of 46.5 mmHg.
A chest X-ray () showed patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities. The patient's clinical presentation of shortness of breath and hypoxia together with elevated D-dimer levels prompted a chest CT to rule out pulmonary embolism. The chest CT demonstrated notable diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities () and arterial embolism in the pulmonary arteries supplying the right middle and lower lobes.
Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 ribonucleic acid (RNA) conducted on a nasopharyngeal swab sample of the patient revealed a negative result. However, the patient was still considered to have clinical COVID-19, given he had typical features of COVID-19 such as hypoxia, shortness of breath, elevated D-dimer, pulmonary embolism, and ground glass opacities on chest CT. Thereby, dexamethasone (6 mg) for COVID-19 and apixaban for pulmonary embolism were initiated. Decision was made to hold remdesivir since COVID-19 was not confirmed in this patient.
During further questioning, the patient reported productive yellowish cough during the last month coupled with anorexia and significant weight loss of 15 pounds. The insidious onset of the long-lasting symptoms and the radiological features characterized by ground glass opacities seen in Pneumocystis pneumonia as opposed to patchy and peripheral ground glass opacities of typical COVID-19 pneumonia () prompted further investigation for potential occult immunodeficiency. The fourth-generation Ag/Ab combination human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1/2 immunoassay showed a positive result for HIV-1 antibody and negative for HIV-2 antibody. Repeat PCR tests for COVID-19 on day 3 and day 5 of hospitalization were negative as well. Thereafter, IV trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 400 mg every 8 hours was started for possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) given the new diagnosis of HIV. Dexamethasone was switched to prednisone 40 mg oral twice a day.
Bronchoscopy was performed on day 4 of hospitalization, and bronchoalveolar culture, Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain, silver stain, and Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR were performed on the specimen obtained. Cells obtained via bronchial washing were negative for malignancy, and no fungal elements were visualized by methenamine silver stain. No acid-fast bacilli were detected on AFB staining, and neither any Mycobacterium species was isolated in the mycobacterial culture. HIV viral load was 1.4 million copies/ml, and total cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count was <20 cells/mcl. Treatment with oral emtricitabine/tenofovir and oral dolutegravir was, thus, initiated.
PCR for Pneumocystis jirovecii on material obtained via BAL revealed a positive result. The patient's presentation of chronic symptoms as opposed to acute presentation of COVID-19 patients together with a positive HIV test, high viral load, low CD4 count, and positive PCR for Pneumocystis jirovecii contributed to establishing the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia. After one more week of continued treatment with IV antibiotics and prednisone, the patient's condition improved and he was discharged with instructions for home oxygen therapy and prescription for apixaban, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (800 mg/160 mg), prednisone, dolutegravir, and emtricitabine/tenofovir.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': True, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [126.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Hemoptysis': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': True, 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False}",6.0,6.0,6.0,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

The patient's heart rate is 126.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5.
Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 4.5.
Because the patient has been previously diagnosed for pulmonary embolism (PE), but the patient has never been diagnosed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0.

5166,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8662753-1,Extracted,"A 17-year-old male with UC was referred to Kyungpook National University Children's Hospital due to acute pancreatitis. He had been diagnosed with UC a year prior to admission and remission had been induced and maintained by medications including prednisolone, mesalazine, and azathioprine. All drugs were sequentially stopped in consideration of drug-induced pancreatitis; however, pancreatitis recurred with development of symptoms of mild abdominal pain and intermittent hematochezia. Family and past medical histories were unremarkable.
On admission, his vital signs were stable and within normal limits. Physical examination revealed rapid weight loss of 23 kg over 1 year. Initial laboratory tests demonstrated the following: white blood cell count 5,170/μL; hemoglobin level, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 251,000/μL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 58 mm/h; C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 0.35 mg/dL; amylase, 1,319 U/L; and lipase, 809 U/L. Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) was positive. The fecal calprotectin (FC) level was 814 mg/kg. Other laboratory findings, including IgG, antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-mitochondrial antibody, were all within the normal range. Sigmoidoscopy showed superficial ulcers and erosions confined to the rectum (). These findings were improved when compared to his initial colonoscopy at time of diagnosis which had revealed pancolitis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated peripancreatic fat stranding and a perisplenic pseudocyst (). Diagnostic exome sequencing of genetic mutations of CFTR, SPINK1, and PRSS1, revealed no pathological variants. No congenital abnormalities were seen on magnetic resonance cholangiopantcreatography. Methylprednisolone was started at a dose of 30 mg/day. Despite corticosteroid treatment, pancreatitis persisted and hematochezia worsened. Corticosteroids were stopped and treatment with infliximab (IFX) was started.
After the second dose of IFX infusion, mild decreases in amylase and lipase levels were seen. However, at the visit for his third IFX infusion, laboratory tests were as follows: ESR, 59 mm/h; CRP level, 0.05 mg/dL; amylase, 1,083 U/L; and lipase, 2,040 U/L. FIT was negative. The FC level was 63 mg/kg. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a focal mass-forming inflammatory lesion in the pancreatic tail (). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) was used to sample the pancreatic mass (). Histology revealed atypical cells. In addition, serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 was elevated at 415.94 U/mL. Considering the possibility of pancreatic cancer, surgery was scheduled. Preoperative positron emission tomography-CT showed no abnormal uptake other than by the inflammatory pancreatic lesions. Chest CT was normal. Laparoscopic distal pancreatosplenectomy was conducted (). Histological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed chronic pancreatitis with storiform fibrosis and infiltration of IgG4-positive cells ().
After surgery, amylase and lipase levels decreased to 55 U/L and 45 U/L, respectively. Serum CA 19-9 normalized to 29.64 U/mL. The patient is currently 18 years old and is in clinical and biochemical remission on IFX at a dose of 5 mg/g at 8-week intervals for maintenance treatment of UC. No recurrence of pancreatitis has occurred at 9 months postoperatively.

On physical exam, his vital signs were blood pressure 126/68 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 99.4 °F. Abdominal exam revealed distension tenderness to Mcburney’s point, with guarding and rigidity but bowel sounds were normal. Laboratory data showed hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, hematocrit 40.1%, white count 8.1 × 103/µL, platelets 172 × 103/µL, sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 4.6 mmol/L, chloride 99 mmol/L, bicarbonate 20 mmol/L, BUN 24 mg/dL, creatinine 2.1 mg/dL and glucose 181 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen showed the perforated appendicitis with two appendicoliths seen in the right lower quadrant (). Laparoscopic appendectomy with drainage of periappendiceal abscess was performed. Surgical pathology of appendix showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell (< 50% signet ring component) and carcinoid features involving muscular wall (). Tumor was penetrating and perforating the visceral serosa and diffusely infiltrating > 4/5 wall of the proximal portion of appendix with lymphovascular invasion. Special studies showed that the tumor is immunoreactive to CK20 (), focal to CD56, chromogranin (), synaptophysin; negative to CK7 (), TTF-1, PSA and CDx2. Mucin stain is positive (). The immunostains support the diagnosis. Patient was started on chemotherapy and after 3 months, patient complained of abdominal pain for which CT abdomen was performed which showed findings suspicious for spreading cancer.

He was reported by the paramedics to be hypotensive and tachycardic prior to arrival. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and gouty arthritis. On presentation to the emergency department, the patient appeared critically ill with generalized pallor, perioral cyanosis, with a heart rate of 133 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 130/106 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 15 L O2 via a nonrebreather mask. His exam was significant for grunting, otherwise clear bilateral breath sounds, rapid but regular heart tones, weak femoral pulses, and symmetric, non-edematous lower extremities.
Shortly after arrival, a bedside ultrasound was performed, demonstrating a thrombus in the right ventricle (RV) and inferior vena cava (IVC) (Figures and ). The patient lost cardiac motion during the ultrasound, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated with return of spontaneous circulation within one minute. He was emergently intubated, and his postintubation oxygen saturation was noted to be 60%, despite 100% FiO2 and confirmation of adequate tube placement. A repeat bedside ultrasound was performed with visualization of an enlarged right ventricle (), and an EKG demonstrated a new right bundle branch block (), highly suspicious for a massive pulmonary embolus. Shortly thereafter, the patient again lost pulses requiring CPR and 1 mg IV epinephrine, with subsequent return of spontaneous circulation in three minutes. The patient's blood pressure was maintained on a continuous infusion of epinephrine, and bolus dosing of alteplase (tPA) was being prepared while a CT angiogram (CTA) of the thorax was ordered. The CTA confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral massive pulmonary emboli (PE) (), and alteplase was administered at a bolus dose of 0.6 mg/kg over 2 minutes followed by a heparin infusion and admitted to the ICU without further hemodynamic decompensation.
The patient's course was complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces, acute renal failure, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. However, he was ultimately extubated and discharged home with full neurologic recovery, and a repeat CTA chest demonstrated resolution of pulmonary thrombi (). A deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the left distal popliteal vein with an aneurismal dilation of the popliteal vein was diagnosed during his inpatient stay, thought to be related a recent flare of gouty arthritis. The patient is currently awaiting outpatient work-up for possible coagulopathy and continues on warfarin anticoagulation.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [130.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [106.0, 'mm hg']}",114.0,108.3,119.7,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

7977,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4551368-1,Extracted,"A 6-year-old white boy was diagnosed to have a large aortopulmonary collateral artery during preoperative evaluation for adenoidectomy. He had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection, symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and scoliosis. Saturation was normal and no abnormal auscultation findings were noted. His weight was 20.7kg (25–50 percentile) and height 119cm (75 percentile).
Prenatal exposure to carbamazepine because of maternal epilepsy was reported. He was delivered at term (birth weight 3100g). He underwent ventricular and atrial septal defects correction in the perinatal period. Since birth facial malformations (long philtrum, micrognathia, epicanthic fold) and paralysis of facial muscles resulting from dysfunction of the seventh cranial nerve were documented. DiGeorge syndrome and array-CGH deletions were excluded.
On chest X-ray were signs of bronchitis and hyperperfusion of his right lung (Fig. ). An echocardiogram showed no shunts and no evidence of ventricular overload. A computed tomography (CT) angiography scan revealed an abnormal vessel arising from the thoracic descending aorta coursing toward his right upper lung. On endovascular occlusion, the angiogram confirmed the hyperperfusion of the right upper lobe (Fig. ). The diameter of the aberrant vessel was up to 8mm. No lung anomaly or other abnormal vessels were detected. Three-dimensional volume rendering of the malformation is shown in Fig. .
Pulmonary hyperperfusion is a risk factor for recurrent cardiorespiratory infection and lung hypertension. This risk is probably higher in syndromic malformations. A mini-invasive vascular occlusion was attempted after a multidisciplinary evaluation (pediatric cardiologist, pediatrician, pediatric surgeon and interventional radiologist).
Under general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided right femoral common artery access was gained. The major aortopulmonary collateral artery (MAPCA) was easily catheterized with a 4F vertebral Glidecath catheter. The hypertrophied pulmonary arteries of the superior lobe were opacified as well as the normal venous drainage excluding a lobar sequestration. Due to the very short length and ascending direction of MAPCA, coils as embolic agents were excluded because of the high risk of nontarget embolization. Through the Glidecath a 6mm bi-segmentary Amplatzer plug type IV was released but it appeared undersized and unstable. The plug was withdrawn from the outer portion. The Glidecath 4F was exchanged over a stiff wire with a 4F 55cm-long Cook sheath with its distal tip in the pulmonary tree. A new tree segments (or lobes) 8mm Amplatzer plug type II was released through the sheath inside the MAPCA. At completion angiography through the side arm of the sheath the MAPCA was embolized (Fig. ). Hemostasis was done at the femoral entry by manual compression.
A chest radiogram and CT showed normalization of the vascular pattern of the right lung at 9-months follow-up (Fig. ).
No complications and no respiratory infections in the first follow-up year were observed. A good growth gain was observed: weight 25kg, 75 percentile; height 121cm, 75 percentile.",What is the patient's body surface area?

5236,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8489187-1,Extracted,"A previously healthy 67-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the outpatient service of Neurology Division in April 2015, complaining of numbness of hands and feet, and inability to walk that had started two years before with progressive worsening, associated with weight loss of 14kg. He denied dry mouth and eyes or sweating, gastrointestinal or sexual dysfunction, previous diseases, and any relevant familial medical history. No abnormalities were found on general clinical examination, but skinny complexion. At neurological assessment, Medical Research Council scale (MRC) was grade 5 in all muscles, except grade 1 for flexion and extension of the feet; slight atrophy was found in feet intrinsic muscle added to global areflexia, positive Romberg sign, superficial hypoesthesia at toes, severe loss of vibratory sensation up to elbows and knees. Blood pressure and heart rate were 130x82 mmHg and 83 bpm, respectively, on supine position, and 125x80 mmHg and 92 bpm, respectively, after 3 minutes on standing position; cranial nerves were preserved; 51 points on Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS); score 2 for upper (U) and 2 for lower (L) limbs (L) on Overall Neurological Limitation Scale (ONLS). Except for IgA lambda-MG in serum immunofixation, a slightly elevated serum beta-2 microglobulin of 2.0 mg/mL (RR = 1.0-1.7 mg/mL) and mild anemia (hemoglobin of 11,5 g/dL, RR = 13-18 g/dL), other laboratory tests were normal, including complete blood count, vitamin B12 and folic acid serum levels, serum kappa and lambda free light-chains ratio, liver, renal and thyroid functions, blood glucose, lactic dehydrogenase, calcium, serology for infectious diseases (HIV, B, and C hepatitis, VDRL), antinuclear and rheumatoid factors, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-SSA/SSB, total complement and fractions, anti-cardiolipin, prostatic specific antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha fetus protein, and urinalysis with protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were normal, and 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy (SC) did not show abnormal uptake in bones. Bone marrow aspirate was normal. The CSF showed 1 cell/mm3 and 88 mg/dL (RR < 45mg/dL) of protein with 16% gamma (RR < 14%). Anti-nerve antibodies detection was not available. An external ENMG showed longer motor distal and F wave latencies, moderately reduced motor nerve conduction velocity, no conduction block or abnormal temporal dispersion, slightly reduced motor amplitude data, and was interpreted as a primarily demyelinating process with slight secondary axonal degeneration fulfilling demyelination criteria of EFNS/PNS.
DADS with IgA lambda-MGUS was diagnosed, and the patient started on monthly pulse therapy with intravenous (iv) methylprednisolone (MP, 1000 mg/day/3days) from May to October 2015. No clinical-laboratory evidence of any systemic disease arose, NIS remained unchanged, but worsening in ONLS (2 UL and 3 LL) lead to the addition of monthly cyclophosphamide (1g/iv/month) to MP from December 2015 to May 2016, and then changed to oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) for 7 months.
In March 2016, under immunosuppressive therapy, the patient started with sexual distress complaints. Except for the IgA lambda-MG, extensive serum reinvestigation and thoracic and abdominal CT remained normal. The ENMG () was remade and showed unexpected and marked axonal impairment.
Autonomic evaluation disclosed the absence of cutaneous sympathetic reflex in all limbs and reduced cardiac variability at rest and with a deep breath and Valsalva maneuver (RR interval = 901.2 ± 4.6 ms). The uptake in fifth and seventh ribs observed in 99mTC-MDP SC () was not confirmed in 99mTC-MIBI SC (). No plasmacytosis or other alterations were seen in bone marrow aspirate, and a subcutaneous (SC) tissue biopsy resulted negative for amyloid deposition under Congo red staining.
Despite the negative SC biopsy result, AL was still suspected associated with the IgA lambda component. Due to the marked motor worsening (NIS 88.5, ONLS 3 UL and 5 LL) and the onset of pain and other autonomic complaints (orthostatic intolerance and voiding dysfunction), Fludarabine (100 mg/iv/monthly) was prescribed from December 2016 to April 2017, resulting in slight improvement (NIS 83.5, ONLS 3 UL and 4 LL) and disappearance of bone uptake in coastal arches but showing distension of urinary tract ().
A sural nerve biopsy (February 2018) revealed amyloid deposition () with IgA positivity and non-specific lambda light-chain staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (-). Kidney dysfunction started in 2018 with a protein/creatinine ratio of 1,59 (RR = 0.06 – 0.35). Imaging studies showed renal parenchyma with normal thickness and echotexture associated with dilatation of urinary tract and thickened and trabeculated bladder walls (data not shown).
Still denying any suspected familial history, the patient brought us in October 2018 a photograph of his mother at the age of 60 years old showing a very lean lady with atrophic hands, who was bedridden for several years and died at 82 years old due to a non-confirmed bone malignancy. This information led us to search for a mutation in the TTR gene to find a heterozygous Val30Met mutation. At the age of 69 years, a liver transplant was not indicated due to the risk associated with age, low body mass index, and renal dysfunction. Tafamidis was also not indicated due to familial amyloidosis staging system score of II (ambulatory but require assistance) and IIIb at polyneuropathy disability score (walking with the help of two sticks). Only in 2019 was it possible to carry out an IHC staining for TTR in the stored nerve tissue biopsy, which showed positive staining at the same sites of previous IgA deposition ().
Tc99m-pyrophosphate SC showed strong diffuse uptake in ventricular walls in February 2019 (), with heart/contralateral area ratio of 1.9 and 1.7 after 1 and 3 hours, respectively, highly suggestive of ATTR. At the last follow-up in April 2019, the patient reported a stable neurological condition, sporadic pain in lower limbs, and denied any autonomic symptoms; NIS and ONLS had not changed since 2017. The patient deceased in July 2019 of undetermined cause in another medical service where the autopsy was not performed.
Being performed in January 2021, under research settings, laser microdissection and mass spectrometry analysis (LC/MS) showed only TTR in amyloid on nerve biopsy ().","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [14.0, 'kg']}",48.0,45.6,50.4,"The patient's weight is 14.0 kg.

There was no history of swelling or morning stiffness of joints, no history of repeated fractures or similar illness in family. She was admitted for jaundice 3 years back. She was given mega doses of vitamin D before she referred to our center.
On examination she was normally built and nourished with height 138 cm and weight 27 kg, and vital signs and parameters were normal. On Local examination, knee joint was normal and there was genu valgum with bimalleolar distance of 13 cm; angulations were more in right than left (). Rest of systemic examination was found to be normal.

The signs and symptoms of the disease – edema and pain affecting the left leg-began 7 days before admission. The patient's medical history was significant for hepatitis C (HCV), treated with ribavarin and interferon, and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. On the day of admission the HCV-RNA test was negative. A mosquito bite was the probable triggering event.
On admission to the ICU the patient was confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9. He was afebrile, had tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, hypotension, with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and relative respiratory insufficiency (oxygen saturation of 88% – 90%). He had moderately-dilated pupils with a delayed light reflex. We noted crepitus over the bilateral lung fields, a tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and oliguria. There were numerous hemorrhagic extravasations on the skin. Examination of the left leg revealed diffuse edema of the skin, with marked erythema and necrosis; margins of infection were sharply demarcated, spreading onto the buttock and perineum on the left side (Figure ). Laboratory tests showed a metabolic acidosis, with the following values: base excess -15 mmol/l, lactate level 7.3 mmol/l, PaO2 64 mmHg, platelet count 29,000/mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.24, serum creatinine 691.6 μmol/l, bilirubin 62.6 μmol/l, and C-reactive Protein (CRP) 224.6 μg/dl.
The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of admission was 31 points and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 18 points. The patient required fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation in BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) mode, continuous intravenous infusion of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and low doses of steroids to restore blood pressure. After obtaining cultures from the affected tissue, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in appropriate media, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately administered (meropenem 3 g/day in a 3-h infusion, vancomycin 3 g/day in continuous infusion, metronidazole 1.5/day in 3 divided doses). Because of progressive organ dysfunction, therapy was started with activated protein C, in doses of 24 μg/kg/h; continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was also started. After several hours, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute and his blood pressure decreased to 80/50 mmHg. Electrical cardioversion was performed three times, followed by continuous infusion of cordarone (12 mg/kg/day). During this time, intensive fluid resuscitation was administered. During the first day, the patient received 12,800 ml of fluid (colloids and crystalloids). His unstable condition did not allow for early surgical management.
The cultures from the affected areas of skin contained Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus sciuri. Based on sensitivity results, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and penicillin G was started at a dose of 60 million units a day (intravenous) in 6 divided doses. Because the patient's poor condition persisted and the microbes were sensitive to clindamycin, it was added at 2.7 g/day in 3 divided doses. In spite of the lack of information about G-pathogens, meropenem was continued. The patient also received 40 g of commercially available gamma-globulin (intravenous), 8 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8 units of platelets. After several days his condition improved, with urine output of 100–150 ml/h and resolution of his metabolic acidosis. On the sixth day, the patient's hemodynamic parameters deteriorated again, with tachycardia to 160 beats per minute and a decrease in blood pressure to 85/60 mmHg. CVVH was administered again for detoxification. On the seventh day, the necrotic tissue was surgically excised (Figures , ). We also noted a progressive decline in the white blood cell count to 2,200/mm3, and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor.
Cultures of the BAL showed 104 colony-forming units/ml of methycillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (The patient had been a carrier of methycillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] isolated from his nose vestibule on admission.) Because MRSA also was present in blood cultures and the patient's condition remained poor, linezolid 1.2 g a day in 2 divided doses was initiated based on additional results of susceptibility tests. After 10 days of intensive treatment, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and we discontinued mechanical ventilation. 25 days after admission the patient was discharged to the trauma surgery ward for plastic reconstruction of his wounds.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [43, 'years'], 'weight': [115.0, 'kg'], 'height': [198.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [691.6, 'µmol/L']}",17.406,16.536,18.276,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 43 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 691.6 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 691.6 µmol. To convert 691.6 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 691.6 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000692 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000692 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.078 g creatinine. To convert 0.078 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.078 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 78.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 78.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 7.8 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 691.6 µmol creatinine/L converts to 7.8 mg creatinine/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 198.0 cm, which is 198.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.98 m. The patient's weight is 115.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 115.0 kg / (1.98 m * 1.98 m) = 29.334 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 29.3, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 198.0 cm, which is 198.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 77.953 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (77.953 (in inches) - 60) = 91.292 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 91.292 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 91.292 kg + 0.4 * (115.0 kg  - 91.292 kg) = 100.775 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 100.775 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 43) * 100.775 * 1) / (7.8 * 72) = 17.406 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 17.406 mL/min."

On day 1 of the illness, he had developed gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting and watery diarrhea that occurred 4-5 times per day. Four days later, bilateral generalized tonic-clonic seizures began, for which he was transported to our hospital. The seizures lasted up to 1 minute and subsided spontaneously. The patient was in a restless state of consciousness (level E3V4M5 according to the Glasgow Coma Scale and level II-10 according to the Japan Coma Scale). He stared, averted his gaze, continued to cry, and threw objects. This disturbance of consciousness persisted for 7 hours. The patient was sedated with midazolam, and MRI was performed. On awakening after 2 hours, the patient had regained a normal state of consciousness, after which there was no recurrence of disturbance of consciousness or seizures.
On admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature, 37.7°C; heart rate, 130 beats/minute; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; and SpO2, 98% (room air). No central nervous system abnormality, meningeal irritation, paralysis, or abnormalities in the thoracoabdominal region were observed. MRI revealed a hyperintense signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum on DWI and a hypointense signal in the ADC-map (). The patient's peripheral circulation was good.
The patient's medical history was unremarkable. He was born by spontaneous cephalic delivery after 39 weeks and 3 days of gestation (birth weight, 2664 g). No remarkable observations were noted during the pregnancy or perinatal period. The patient's growth and development were normal. The family medical history revealed that the father had febrile seizures.
The results of the patient's biochemical blood tests were as follows: WBCs, 3900/μL; Hb, 13.4 g/dL; Plt, 26.1 × 104/μL; BUN, 16 mg/dL; Cre, 0.3 mg/dL; Na, 132 mEq/L; K, 4.5 mEq/L; Cl, 101 mEq/L; AST, 41 IU/L; ALT, 21 IU/L; CRP, 2.59 mg/dL; Glu, 84 mg/dL; lactic acid, 7.8 mg/dL; pyruvic acid, 0.32 mg/dL; NH3, 49 μg/dL; pH, 7.424; PCO2, 39.6 mmHg; HCO3, 25.5 mmol/L; and BE, 1.6 mmol/L. No abnormality was detected on blood amino acid analysis or tandem mass screening. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a cell count of 4 cells (all mononuclear), a glucose concentration of 95 mg/dL, and a total protein concentration of 16 mg/dL.
On day 2 of admission, an electroencephalogram was obtained during sedated sleep. The spindle wave was appropriate for the patient's age. No bursts were observed. The patient's stool was positive for RV antigen. RT-PCR did not reveal RV RNA in the blood or CSF. RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from the stool revealed that the RV genotype was G5P[6].

The concentration of sodium is 132.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 25.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 25.5 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 25.5 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 25.5 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 25.5 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 25.5 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 132.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 25.5 mEq/L) = 5.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 5.5 mEq/L."

8666,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8214352-1,Extracted,"We present a 16-year-old boy referred from urology for further evaluation of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. He was initially diagnosed with bilateral cryptorchidism aged 2, and his parents opted for conservative management. There was no spontaneous descent of testes in the next few years and he was eventually lost to follow up. He was referred again to urology aged 12, for recurrent urinary tract infections and was diagnosed with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) warranting bilateral ureteric stenting and implantation. There were no other structural or functional abnormalities of the renal system identified. Cryptorchidism was reevaluated at this point and he underwent bilateral orchidopexy, with successful descent only on the left side. Routine clinical and hormonal assessment done at this juncture revealed hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, warranting an endocrine consult.
Detailed history taking from parents and physical examination elicited the following salient clinical features. He was born full-term with an uneventful antenatal history. His height and weight remained within the 25th and 50th centile till the age of 10. A decline in growth rate was noticed as he approached adolescence, whereby he was one of the shortest amongst his peers in secondary school. He had been a slow learner, with poor academic performance since primary school. His parents had noticed him having low energy levels and fatiguability in the later years. No history of anosmia or hearing deficits was elicited. He had no history of polyuria or polydipsia to suggest cranial diabetes insipidus. A full systemic review did not reveal symptoms to suggest intra-cranial mass effect such as chronic headaches, visual disturbances or neurological deficits. He had no past history of intracranial pathology, trauma or radiation. Apart from the history of VUR and cryptorchidism, he did not suffer from any chronic diseases nor receive long term immunosuppression/steroids or chemotherapy. He has no family history of short stature nor delayed puberty. He has one younger sibling, a 12-year-old female who has achieved puberty and is of appropriate height. His anthropometric measurements of weight and height were charted as 58 kg (between 5-10th centile), 155 cm (below 5th centile) respectively. His height was significantly lower than his mid-parental height of 170 cm. On physical examination, he had no midline facial deformities to suggest a syndromic constellation. Secondary sexual characteristics were also absent. Tanner staging for pubic hair and genitalia was pre pubertal (stage 1) with absent pubic hair, micropenis, minimal hyperpigmentation with no ruggae over the scrotum and testicular volume measuring approximately 1 ml (left) and absent (right).
His anterior pituitary hormone panel showed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with low FSH, low LH and undetectable testosterone levels. Insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels was found to be lower than expected for his age and gender raising the suspicion of concomitant growth hormone (GH) deficiency. His other pituitary hormones were intact. (). Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) with testosterone priming was carried out to confirm growth hormone deficiency. This test was inconclusive due to failure to achieve adequate hypoglycemia.
As an alternative test, Glucagon Stimulation Test (GST) was chosen. GST showed a peak GH of 6.94 ng/ml (>10 ng/ml) at 90 mins confirming his growth hormone deficiency. Bone age assessment showed his skeletal age to lag at the age of 12-13 years with unfused epiphyseal plates. A MRI pituitary ordered showed an enlarged pituitary stalk extending to the tuber cinereum with homogenous enhancement post gadolinium contrast. The stalk measured 13 mm (AP diameter) at the point of insertion at the infundibulum with uniformed pattern of thickening. The pituitary gland itself was not hypoplastic, with no focal enhancement on post contrast study. The optic nerve, chiasm and tract was not thickened, with no evidence of compression. ( and ). Therefore, at this point it was concluded that this patient had thickened pituitary stalk with partial hypopituitarism (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency).
The etiology of thickened pituitary stalk was worked up extensively involving laboratory and radiological investigations. His complete blood count showed no evidence of hematological dyscrasias. His liver and renal biochemistry was normal. Both inflammatory and tumor markers were not raised. There was no evidence of mediastinal or lung mass on chest x-ray. Ultrasound showed very small testes in the right inguinal region and left scrotum measuring 1.2-1.5 cm, both testes had no suspicious malignant features or associated lymphadenopathy. In summary, there were no red flags to suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic process. A multidisciplinary discussion was held to discuss the role of pituitary stalk biopsy for him. The presence of pre-pubertal features representing gonadotroph deficiency early in life coupled with non-suspicious laboratory and imaging workup was highly suggestive of congenital origin of disease. Therefore, a decision was made not to proceed with pituitary stalk biopsy unless there is evidence of disease extension or progressive loss of pituitary function.
Growth hormone, norditrophin at a dose of 0.025 mcg/kg/day was initiated in this boy aiming to achieve near adult height. He showed good response to therapy with a 4 cm increment in height after 3 months. Puberty induction will be initiated once acceptable near adult height is achieved. Serial MRI pituitary and pituitary hormone panel will be repeated every 6 months to monitor progression of disease. He is also planned for removal of the right testis due to risk of malignancy and poor function.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [58.0, 'kg'], 'height': [155.0, 'cm']}",54.613,51.882,57.344,"The patient's gender is Male.

Electron microscopy revealed abundant intra-myocyte lysosomes with numerous large, dense myelin figures occupying large portions of the myocyte sarcoplasm. Lysosomal inclusions with curvilinear substructures were also noted (). There was no evidence of amyloid deposition, myocarditis, or an acute vasculitic process. Chloroquine toxicity was diagnosed based on the pathologic findings and the hydroxychloroquine was promptly discontinued. A permanent pacemaker was inserted for management of sick sinus syndrome. Four months later, the follow-up TTE demonstrated no significant interval change in LV systolic function or the LV wall thickness compared with the previous examination. However, LV diastolic function improved from restrictive physiology to pseudonormal relaxation.

8548,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-4121497-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old woman diagnosed with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis was scheduled for elective living-donor liver transplantation. The patient's height and weight were 157 cm and 58 kg, respectively. Her Child-Pugh classification grade was A with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 8. She had no specific medical history. Her laboratory findings included hemoglobin 9.6 g/dl, platelet 47,000 /mm3, INR 1.19, albumin 3.7 g/dl, and total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl. Her preoperative chest X-ray revealed no active lung lesion. The dynamic liver CT scan showed liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed esophageal varix which was treated by propranolol.
The patient did not take any premedication before surgery. Upon arrival in the operating room, routine monitoring including five-lead electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry was started. Her blood pressure was 115/75 mmHg, heart rate was 65 beats/min, and the oxygen saturation was 100%. Before induction of anesthesia, the right radial artery was cannulated to monitor continuous arterial pressure. The anesthesia was induced using thiopental 250 mg, fentanyl 100 µg, and midazolam 5 mg. Vecuronium 10 mg was injected for the ease of endotracheal intubation. The patient was aseptically prepared and draped for central venous catheterization. A 7.5- Fr pulmonary artery catheter (Swan Ganz CCOmbo V; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was inserted via a 9.0- Fr introducer (AVA HF; Edwards Lifesciences) through the right subclavian vein. The right subclavian vein was chosen because an 11.5 Fr. two-lumen central venous catheter (Mahurkar, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) had been inserted in the right internal jugular vein (IJV) preoperatively for the purpose of therapeutic plasmapheresis owing to ABO incompatible transplantation. The tip of the PAC was ballooned and advanced through the introducer without resistance. While observing the waveforms of the PAC, the pressure wave on the monitor continuously showed a form of central venous pressure although the catheter was nearly 40 cm inside the vein. The catheter was pulled back outside the sheath for reinsertion. Further attempts were made, but the waveform did not change to a right ventricular pressure waveform. The vital signs were stable and no arrhythmia was present. Thus, to avoid any complications, an anteroposterior chest X-ray was taken when the catheter was about 40 cm inside the vein. The X-ray revealed that the PAC had erroneously advanced straight into the left brachiocephalic vein and turned to its opposite direction to slip into another vein that drains into the left brachiocephalic vein (). We were convinced that the catheter was not placed extravascularly and was therefore not resting on the mediastinum or in the pleural space, as confirmed by stable vital signs with freely regurgitating blood and intact lung parenchyma in the chest X-ray. Also, a venous anomaly such as bilateral superior vena cava was ruled out by a preoperative chest CT scan. We assumed that the catheter had most likely slipped through the left pericardiophrenic vein from the left brachiocephalic vein since the catheter follows the left heart border similarly to the route of this vein. We cautiously reviewed the chest CT once more with the radiologist and noticed that there were branches stemming out from the left brachiocephalic vein, which appeared to be the left pericardiophrenic vein (). The surgery was processed without the PAC insertion. Fortunately, the surgery was finished uneventfully and the patient had discharged from the hospital after 17 days.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [58.0, 'kg'], 'height': [157.0, 'cm']}",52.999,50.349,55.649,"The patient's gender is Female.

She had been suffering from recurrent oral and genital ulcers that were not properly treated for 10 years. Moreover, she had a history of early miscarriage and had been suffering from infertility for two years after that unfavorable event. For this reason, the patient visited the Infertility Center and later consulted the Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology. Moreover, the genital ulcers and the stomatitis got worse. Her physical examination revealed a 5 mm aphthous ulcer on the left side of the tongue. In addition, a genital ulcer was identified on the inside of the left labia minora (Figures and ). The patient's diagnosis was an incomplete-type BD, with the main symptoms being recurrent genital and oral ulcerations (herpetiform) and skin lesions. Furthermore, no arthritis, gastrointestinal, vascular, or ocular lesions were observed. Laboratory analyses revealed that total protein (TP) [8.2 g/dL (normal range, 6.5–8.2)], C-reactive protein (CRP) [0.44 mg/dL (normal range, 0.00–0.30)], immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels [2266 mg/dL (normal range, 870–1700)], white blood cell count (WBC) [9300/μL (normal range, 4000–9000)], and 50% hemolytic complement activity (CH50) [57.3 U/mL (normal range, 30–45)] were higher than the normal levels, while iron (Fe) levels [29 μg/dL (normal range, 48–154)] were lower than normal.

Other laboratory findings related to miscarriage, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (anti-CL IgM Ab, anti-PE IgG Ab, and anti-PE IgM Ab), autoimmune disease (ANA and anti-DNA Ab), and disorders of blood coagulation (protein S activity, protein C activity, and factor XII activity), were all negative.
All the general fertility tests, including the husband's semen analysis, performed at the Department of Reproductive Medicine indicated no apparent abnormalities. Therefore, we performed AIH through ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate for treating unexplained infertility. After the failure of first AIH, the patient was treated with 10 mg/day prednisolone (PSL) for 4 weeks, which improved the genital ulcer, chronic inflammation (TP, platelet (PLT), CRP, CH50, Fe, and IgG), and immune status (Th2 and NK activity) (, Figures and ). Pregnancy was established at the second AIH attempt after PSL administration. PSL was maintained at 8 mg/day during the course of the pregnancy, and no mucosal lesions were observed.

The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mEq. To convert from 134.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 134.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 134.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 134.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 134.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 22.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 213.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 134.0 + (22.0 / 2.8) + (22.0 / 18) = 287.69 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 287.69 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 287.69 mOsm/kg."

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 20.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 20.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.

His initial blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg with a pulse rate of 130 beats/min.
His temperature was 36.9°C axial. Respiratory rate was 20 per min with a SpO2 of 96% on 2 L of nasal oxygen. Twitching movement with muscle spasm was noticed in the limbs. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter, equal and reactive, and no focal neurological deficit was found. His skin was normal. Bowel sound was normal, and the bladder was not palpable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 139 beats/min, and QT interval was 0.89 s. Neurologic examination was essentially unremarkable except for the depressed level of consciousness. The personal and medical history was unremarkable; including the absence of birthing trauma or febrile seizures. He had no history of use of other drugs.
Laboratory studies while the patient received supplemental oxygen included an arterial blood gas with pH 7.30; pO2104 mm Hg; pCO239 mmHg; and HCO321. A complete blood count revealed white blood cells 10,400/mm3(31% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 64% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes); hemoglobin 12 g; and hematocrit 35%. Blood chemistry studies were unremarkable except for an elevated glucose (219 mg %) obtained while the patient was receiving an IV line with 5% glucose. One day after admission; a repeat glucose level was 89 mg%.
Shortly after arrival at the Emergency Department, he developed one episode of brief generalized convulsion with upward gaze and episode lasting for around 30 s, 5 mg of IV diazepam was administered and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was promptly performed. The latter showed no evidence of intracranial ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions. Serum lidocaine concentration 30 min after the onset of seizures was 5.1 μg/ml. There were no further seizures; the patient remained stable and was discharged 2 days after admission.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [25.0, 'kg']}",65.0,61.75,68.25,"The patient's weight is 25.0 kg. For patient's whose weight is greater than 20 kg, the formula for computing the maintenance fluid is 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 20 kilograms). Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (25.0 kg - 20 kg) = 65.0 mL/hr.

She had undergone postoperative pelvic irradiation for the treatment of uterine cancer 10 years prior to the current admission. Upon admission, her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37°C; heart rate, 98 beats/min; and blood pressure, 176/70mmHg. Her lung and heart sounds were normal. An abdominal examination revealed tenderness, but no muscular tension was evident; bowel sounds were audible. No edema of her extremities was observed. She presented with hyperkalemia (potassium level, 8.1mmol/L), a serum creatinine (s-Cr) level of 9.9mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 107.2mg/dL, indicating renal failure. A work-up of her arterial blood gasses indicated metabolic acidosis (pH7.256; concentration of bicarbonate, 12.3mmol/L). Urine microscopy showed white blood cells 3 to 5 cells per high-power field (hpf) ; red blood cells, 20 to 30/hpf; hyaline casts, 8 to 10/hpf; and the presence of mesothelial cells. A urine analysis showed a value of 3+ for both protein and blood; her urine did not contain myoglobin. An abdominal CT showed intraperitoneal fluid collection, with no other abnormalities (Figure ). After an initial evaluation, hemodialysis was initiated and a transurethral catheter was inserted.
Over the next three days, our patient’s s-Cr and BUN levels rapidly improved, and her daily urine output was good. Because her symptoms disappeared, the transurethral catheter was removed. However, four days after the removal of the transurethral catheter, her symptoms re-occurred; her s-Cr and BUN levels became elevated, and her urinary output gradually declined. At that time, we noted the presence of mesothelial cells in her urine (Figure ), leading to the suspicion of an intraperitoneal rupture of her bladder. Cystoscopy showed a diverticulum in the apex of her bladder and a possible fistula. After the transurethral catheter was re-inserted into her bladder, her symptoms alleviated, and her s-Cr and BUN levels returned to normal.
Our patient underwent surgery to close the fistula and subsequently received 10 hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions. The transurethral catheter was removed after these therapies and her s-Cr and BUN levels remained normal; her urine output also remained similar to that prior to the transurethral catheter removal.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Female', 'creatinine': [9.9, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [71, 'years'], 'Race': 'Asian'}",3.879,3.685,4.073,"The patient is 71 years old.

The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 9.9^(-1.154) * 71^(-0.203) * 1 * 0.742=3.879.

Three days after admission, a trial of induction of labor was attempted by administration of 10 units of oxytocin in 500 ml lactated ringer’s solution at a rate of 2 mU/min for five hours. This resulted in successful vaginal delivery of the fetus. Four hours after delivery, the patient suddenly started to complain of shortness of breath and chest discomfort. She had no fever, cough, or sputum production. She has a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Blood pressure was normal. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention. Chest auscultation revealed the presence of bilateral inspiratory crepitations. There was no swelling or erythema of the lower limbs. Laboratory tests showed a serum sodium level of 139 mEq/L (136-145), potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L (3.5 to 5.1), chloride level of 106 mEq/L (96 to 106), bicarbonate level of 23 mEq/L (23 to 30), creatinine of 0.38 mg/dL (0.50-0.90), WBC of 14,580 cells/dL (4,000-11,000), hemoglobin of 10 g/dL (11 to 13), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 33.8 mg/L (<5), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) of 1234 pg/mL (0-130), troponin T of 5.52 ng/L (<14), D-dimer of 5.77 microgram/mL (<0.5).

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 106.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 23.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (106.0 mEq/L + 23.0 mEq/L) = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 10.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 10.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 10.0 - 12 = -2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -2.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -2.0 mEq/L / 1.0 mEq/L = -2.0. The patient's delta ratio is -2.0."

Since the age of 3 months he started developing multiple skin lesions, initially in the face, which then extended to the whole body, mainly in sun-exposed areas. The family history revealed similar recurrent skin cancers in 2 cousins on the maternal side of the family, who died at ages 8 and 12 years (). At the time of evaluation the patient had developed approximately 15 basal and squamous cell carcinomas in the face, ears, nose, eyes, and the extremities, which were surgically removed and no melanoma had been diagnosed. In addition to the dermatologic manifestations, the patient had been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency due to excessive sun protection and also with detrusor hyperactivity plus detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Since infancy the patient also developed cognitive alterations, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, pes cavus, and progressive gait alterations. At 7 years he was diagnosed with bilateral cryptorchidism and hypogonadism by pediatric endocrinology. The physical exam revealed short stature (height: 133 cm) (<2 SD), microcephaly (head circumference: 47.5 cm) (<2 SD), low weight (26 Kg), intellectual disability, altered speech, ataxic gait, and hyperreflexia, accompanying the skin findings: alopecia, freckle-like skin lesions, actinic keratoses sparing unexposed areas, and marked skin atrophy in eyelids and around the mouth (). Electromyography of the extremities and auditory evoked potentials were normal. Spine MRI revealed a normal spinal cord and cerebral MRI showed parenchymal volume loss, cerebellar atrophy, and white matter gliosis ().

The patient had height of 154 cm and weight of 72 kg. Except for hypertension, no other specific medical history was known. Prior to surgery, there were no abnormal findings in the complete blood count, and electrolyte and blood coagulation tests.
Before anesthetic induction, the patient's blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg, heart rate was 82 beats/min, and oxygen saturation was 98%. Anesthetic induction was conducted with injection of propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 50 mg, followed by endotracheal intubation. General anesthesia was maintained through sevoflurane (1-1.5 %)-O2(2 L/min)-N2O (2 L/min). For direct measurement of the arterial pressure, right radial artery cannulation was performed. It was planned that the patient would be managed in the intensive care unit for a few days after the surgery, and at the request of the orthopedic surgeon, a subclavian venous catheter, which is comparatively convenient for long term maintenance, was to be inserted. Due to a skin lesion in the right subclavian area, central venous catheter insertion was conducted in the left subclavian vein with a two-lumen CVC set (Arrow International, Inc., Reading, PA, USA). The catheter was fixed at a depth of 15 cm while the intravenous supply after blood regurgitation was confirmed. Afterwards, the patient was turned into the prone position on the Wilson frame (OSI, Union City, CA, USA) for the surgery (). After changing the position, the upper chest area from above the nipples and including the subclavian area showed overall compression. In order to prevent pressure by compression, a surgical cotton pad was applied to the applicable area, and free flow of fluid through the CVC was checked before commencing the operation. During the whole operating time of 4 hours and 45 minutes, the mean arterial blood pressure and the heart rate were maintained at 65-75 mmHg and 60-75 beats/min, respectively, showing stable vital signs. Total fluid input during the surgery amounted to 1,200 ml of normal saline, 500 ml of colloid, 5 units of packed red blood cell and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma, and the actual blood loss amounted to 1,500 ml and the urine output was 850 ml. After the operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient was mentally alert, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 61 beats/min. In the blood coagulation test carried out immediately after the operation, the prothrombin time (INR) was measured at 1.13 and activated partial thromboplastin time was 42.3 seconds.
On the next day, there was a sudden occurrence of severe edema in the patient's left arm, and the fingertips of her left hand felt cold. The CVC was removed from the patient immediately. A blood test conducted on the day of the symptom showed that D-dimer had increased above 20 g/ml, which led to the suspicion of deep vein thrombosis. To suppress the swelling, the patient's left arm was wrapped with a pressure bandage, and ultrasonography and computed tomography scan were performed on the patient. On ultrasonography, extensive deep vein thrombosis was observed in the left subclavian vein and caudal branch () while on computed tomography, thrombosis was found in the left brachiocephalic vein and subclavian vein (). Immediately, thrombolysis was conducted in the upper left arm through a venogram (). Over the next 3 days after the thrombolysis, anticoagulation therapy was carried out by concurrently administering heparin 500 IU/h and urokinase 100,000 IU/h, and over the next 6 days, urokinase was stopped and only heparin was administered. The patient showed no more particular complications, and was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks after the treatment.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He has also had a productive cough for the past year and has had a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. He has a history of multiple sclerosis and has not had an acute exacerbation in over 10 years. For the past 30 years, he has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily. He drinks 2 beers every day after work. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and respirations are 22/min. On examination, the patient appears lethargic and cannot state his name or his location. Physical examination reveals scattered wheezing bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes cannot be elicited. Laboratory studies show:

2886,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-7501600-1,Extracted,"An ambulance was called to a 65-year-old Caucasian male with dyspnea and deteriorating consciousness. His son confirmed that the patient had ingested 125 g of Arvalin® (containing 5 g of ZnP) a few hours prior to hospital admission. The patient’s past medical history included chronic alcoholism and depression and his only regular medication was alprazolam (0.5 mg/day). Paramedics performed gastric lavage and aspired a black-colored fluid with garlic-odor from the respiratory tract, on site. Peripheral venous access was obtained and oxygen was administered through a reservoir mask due to low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 92%). Subsequently, the patient started wheezing and was administered 120 mg intravenously (iv.) methylprednisolone. He also vomited and since the vomit was dark-colored and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding could not be completely excluded, 1 g tranexamic acid was given iv.
The patient was then admitted to the emergency unit with the following parameters: 142/80 mmHg blood pressure, 74/min cardiac rate, 88% SpO2, and a Glasgow Coma Scale of 9. Due to impaired levels of SpO2 and consciousness, endotracheal intubation (ETI) was initiated. The patient received assisted mechanical ventilation but his spontaneous breathing persisted (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.4; pressure support 12 cmH2O) and his SpO2 normalized. Due to agitation, the patient was sedated with midazolam (5 mg/h) then a central venous catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein.
The laboratory test showed low calcium and potassium levels, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and low white blood cell count (WBC). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were slightly elevated, while the patient’s alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was within the normal range. Elevated creatinine and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) levels indicated moderate kidney impairment (Table ).
The patient’s urine sample was positive for benzodiazepine; however, quantitative analysis was not carried out, based on the clinical symptoms.
Arterial blood gas results indicated global respiratory insufficiency, mixed acidosis with a moderately elevated anion gap (Table ).
Since physical examination upon admission had revealed dull percussion notes and muffled breath sounds on the right side of the thorax, as well as extensive abdominal pain, imaging was carried out. Chest X-ray and chest CT scan revealed extended alveolar infiltration of the patient’s lungs (Figs. and ).
Abdominal CT scan showed the thickening of the jejunal wall (Fig. ).
Electrolyte replacement was carried out via administration of intravenous crystalloid solutions (20 mmol potassium chloride (8.4%), 1000 mg calcium gluconate in 1500 ml Isolyte® [Fresenius Kabi] iv. and 1500 ml Sterofundin B® [B. Braun Melsungen] iv.). A single dose of 30 g charcoal via nasogastric tube (NG-tube) was given. Due to the observed lung infiltration and the patient’s elevated CRP level (114.9 mg/l), ceftriaxone (2 g per day) was empirically administered and continued for 7 days (Tables and , Fig. ).
Since the patient’s initial liver functions were slightly elevated (Table ), presumably as a consequence of chronic alcohol intake, daily doses of 600 mg ALA (Thiogamma Turbo-Set®) and 2 × 600 mg N-acetylcystein (NAC) iv. were given for 6 and 7 days, respectively. Our assumption regarding the patient’s impaired liver functions was justified by the low levels of pseudocholinesterase (ChE-PS) found on the second, third, fifth, and sixth days of care (Table ).
By the third day of the patient’s care, his potassium level had risen to 6.14 mmol/L (Table ). He received diuretics (furosemide 6 × 10 mg and 1 × 5 mg) and glucose-insulin solution (Actrapid® 10 IE with 500 ml of Glucose B Braun® [50 mg/ml]) iv. as well as polystyrene sulfonate (1 × 50 ml) via NG-tube, whereupon his potassium level declined to a normal level. The patient’s initially moderately impaired kidney functions significantly worsened, then gradually returned to their original levels by the end of the first week (Table ). Since the patient’s respiration became spontaneous and adequate, an attempt to remove the endotracheal tube was made. However, a few hours later tachycardia, and respiratory insufficiency occurred, therefore ETI was required again (Table ).
On day 6, the patient developed fever and microbiological testing from blood samples was carried out. After terminating the administration of ALA, the patient’s AST and ALT levels rose slightly, then the next day, his GGT level rose substantially (Table ).
Although still well below the normal range, the ChE-PS level had increased almost threefold (CHE-PS: 2026 U/L) by day 6 of the patient’s care, and continued to do so until day 14.
On day 7, his CRP level also began to rise (151.5 mg/L) (Table , Fig. ) By the evening, the patient developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Since the arrhythmia did not cause cardial instability, no specific treatment was given. No pathological signs were detected on the chest X-rays made on days 7 and 8 (Fig. b). Nevertheless, suspecting the possibility of a beginning respiratory infection, after consulting with an infectologist specialist, iv. ciprofloxacin (2 × 400 mg per day) was initiated.
On day 8, the patient’s blood culture was found to be positive for Acinetobacter spp. (104 germ count) and sensitive to ciprofloxacin. In spite of the prevailing bacteremia and rising CRP, symptoms of sepsis did not occur, the patient’s procalcitonin level (0.25 μg/L) did not increase, and the administration of vasopressors was not required. On day 9, a second attempt was made for extubation. Due to inadequate expectoration, the patient developed dyspnea, therefore ETI was needed again. The same day a tracheostoma was inserted.
Over the next days, the patient’s hepatic enzymes and CRP level showed a slow, gradual improvement (Table , Fig. ).
On day 11, trickling bleeding appeared through the tracheostoma, which ceased after the administration of tranexamic acid (1 × 1 g iv.).
The patient became agitated on day 14 therefore tiapride (1 × 100 mg iv.) and clonazepam (1 × 1 mg iv.) were given. During his psychiatric examination, the patient non-verbally verified his depression and suicidal attempt. He accepted the offered psychiatric treatment and the initiation of paroxetine (1 × 20 mg/day). Further neurological or psychiatric symptoms could not be detected.
By the end of the second week of the patient’s care, there were no radiological, and laboratory signs (WBC = 11.97G/L, CRP = 53 mg/L) of a respiratory infection (Fig. c). The awoken patient, with stable vital functions, was transferred to the psychiatry department of our hospital.
During his psychiatric care, oral antidepressants were added (cinalozepam 1 × 40 mg per os to paroxetine 1 × 20 mg per os) and the patient began participating in psychotherapy.
While in psychiatric care, bronchoscopy was performed, mucopurulent sputum was aspirated, and subacute mucosal inflammation was detected. The microbiological examination of the sputum revealed the presence of ciprofloxacin-sensitive Acinetobacter spp., with a germ count of 104.
The patient’s clinical status gradually improved. His tracheostoma was removed on the 20th day following hospital admission and his inflammatory markers decreased to normal (WBC, 6.38 G/L) or almost normal (CRP, 5.7) levels by the 41st day of his inpatient care at the hospital.

She had no remarkable medical history, and there were no abnormalities during her medical examination. Her father and uncle had type 2 diabetes requiring insulin therapy. However, her sister did not have diabetes. The weight gain during her first 3 months of pregnancy was 1.1 kg. A regular examination at 29 weeks and 5 days was normal; her blood glucose level was 73 mg/dL, with negative levels of urinary glucose, and 3+ urinary ketone bodies.
At 30 weeks and 6 days, she was admitted with marked fatigue and dyspnea. However, she did not present with fever, headache, costochondritis, pharyngitis, diarrhea, maculopapular non-pruritic rash, nausea, or flu-like symptoms such as a sore throat, cough, or rhinorrhea.
On admission, she was alert. A physical examination revealed the following: temperature (T), 36.7 °C; pulse rate (P), 94 beats per minute (bpm); respiratory rate (R), 18/minute; and blood pressure (BP), 121/65 mmHg; fetal bradycardia was also observed, for which emergency cesarean section was performed, but the child was stillborn. The laboratory findings revealed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with random sample glucose of 427 mg/dL, C-peptide reactivity (CPR) of 0.04 ng/mL, arterial pH of 6.91, bicarbonate of 6.7 mEq/L, and 3+ urinary ketone bodies. Despite the presence of DKA, the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value was within the normal range (6.2%), and urinary CPR was extremely low at 0.5 μg/day. In addition, the serum elastase-1 and lipase levels were increased to 1939 (< 300) ng/dL and 119 (11–53) U/L, respectively. Antibody level against glutamic acid decarboxylase was 1.2 (< 1.5) U/mL. Neither anti-insulin nor anti-insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies were detected. HLA II haplotypes showed DR8,12/DQ7,4. These results were indicative of a FT1D diagnosis (Table ).
She was diagnosed as having DKA due to FT1D. She was simultaneously treated with fluid replacement and continuous insulin infusion to maintain vital signs, plasma glucose, and electrolyte levels. On day 2, ketonuria, electrolytes, and vital signs had normalized. On day 3, the continuous infusion of insulin was withdrawn, and daily multiple insulin injections were administered with blood glucose monitoring. On day 24, she continued to undergo treatment with multiple daily insulin injection therapy with insulin aspart (25 U/day) and insulin degludec (12 U/day).
To investigate the association between viral infection and FT1D, we performed serological testing for several viruses such as parainfluenza virus 1–3, Coxsackievirus A2–7, 9, 10, 16, B1–6, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and human herpes virus (HHV) 6 at day 3, day 17, and day 38 (Table ).

Thrombolysis was performed using 4 mg of alteplase and 8000 units of heparin, followed by mechanical thromboaspiration. An eighty percent stenosis at the genu of the graft was found which was dilated with a balloon catheter. No central venous stenosis was seen.
Follow-up imaging of the entire access circuit after the thrombolysis demonstrated patency of the access. The patient's vital signs were stable throughout the procedure and afterwards, and his INR prior to thrombolysis was 2.0. After completion of the procedure, the patient was noted to be lethargic and aphasic with right-sided hemiparesis.
The patient was then transferred to the emergency room of our hospital. At time of admission, his blood pressure was 150/80 mmHg, heart rate was 60 beats/minute and regular. The neurological examination was significant for dysarthria, right ptosis, occasional vertical nystagmus, dense right upper motor neuron facial paresis, left tongue deviation, and right hemiplegia. His lungs were clear and he had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border. The right forearm graft had a good bruit. His electrocardiogram showed ventricular pacing. Noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodensity within the left posterior parietal lobe (). A CT angiography of the brain and neck showed a small distal basilar filling defect near the left superior cerebellar artery and terminal bifurcation. The patient was not a candidate for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator due to therapeutic INR and he was past the 3-hour window.
A transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study was performed due to strong suspicion of an embolic event, which showed right-to-left shunting, normal sized left atrium, and no evidence of intracardiac thrombus. It also revealed an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure and severe tricuspid regurgitation (an echocardiogram from 2010 showed similar findings of elevated right sided pressure and tricuspid regurgitation). A CT of the chest with pulmonary embolism (PE) protocol was not performed due to low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism because the patient had normal oxygen saturation on room air, no respiratory symptoms, and there were no electrocardiographic changes suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

SD was diagnosed at 3 years of age on the basis of clinical symptoms and increased level of free sialic acid in the urine.
The patient's development during the first year of life was relatively normal, but crawling was unstable and muscular hypotonia and nystagmus were noticed. The patient spoke her first words at 1 year of age and her first sentences at 2 years of age. She learned to walk by 1.5 years of age, but her gait and balance were abnormal. At 3 years of age, her cognitive development was assessed as normal, except for mild slowness and clumsiness when performing fine motor skills. The followup evaluations showed mild delays in motor tasks, eye-hand coordination, and concentration. Her verbal development was slightly delayed, and verbal dyspraxia was reported. At 6 years of age, the developmental delay was approximately 2 years.
Inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and problems with sleep were reported during childhood. The patient also had problems with balance and body awareness. Ataxic symptoms were prominent in childhood, but improved during the teenage years.
During her school years, the neurocognitive development fluctuated notably. Verbal performance was consistently better than visual performance or fine motor skills. Intellectual disability was considered to be mild.
At the age of 12 years, the patient's verbal skills, as assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-R test [], were at the level of a 7 year old, and her performance skills varied between those typical of a child of 5 years 6 months and 6 years 6 months of age. Two years later, her verbal skills had improved. At 14 years of age, no progression was noted in the neurocognitive deficits. The developmental age of the patient varied between 4 and 8 years, and her verbal skills were notably better than her motor and visual abilities.
At the age of 30 years, the proband was living alone with support. She was a social person, keen on the arts and team sports. She was 157 cm in height and weighed 56 kg. She was taking no medications. On examination, auscultation of the heart and lungs was unremarkable, her blood pressure was 114/74 mmHg, and the electrocardiogram was normal. Her facial features were slightly coarse. The proband could walk without aid, but both legs were in a pes planus position. When walking, she had some athetotic movements in her upper extremities. Muscle strength and skin sensation were normal, tendon reflexes were symmetrical and normal, and the plantar responses were in flexion. Both Achilles tendons were slightly shortened and there was mild spasticity in both legs. Neurological examination revealed only mild ataxia. There was mild instability in the Romberg test and the patient was unable to stand with her eyes closed. There was no ataxia or dysmetria shown by coordination tests, but her hand movements were clumsy. She suffered from marked myopia and used six dioptre corrective lenses. Clear outward strabismus was seen in her right eye. However, the eye movements were normal and nystagmus was not detected. The neurological condition of the patient had not deteriorated during the previous 10 years.
There had been no deterioration of the patient's motor skills in adulthood. Her skills had improved with respect to balance, coordination of body movements, and reciprocal motor actions, as well as processing the sequences of movements. The speed of motor actions had become slightly slower during the last few years.
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal at 3 years of age, but showed mild generalized background abnormality with occasional spikes and sharp waves at the left temporo-parieto-central region at 5 years of age. Quantitative EEG was normal at 15 years of age. There was no history of epileptic seizures, but symptoms that resembled the startle reflex were noticed in response to sudden noises.
The methods that were used for neuropsychological evaluation of the patient are presented in . Her developmental age, as assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III [] at the age of 30 years, was 7 years 9 months for the verbal scale and 5 years 4 months for the perceptual scale. Her neurocognitive performance was remarkably better than those of other patients with the conventional type of SD and the SallaFIN mutation []. Other patients with SD (n = 37) have been evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II [], because the tasks that are used in the Wechsler children's tests were too demanding.
There was a slowing in visuomotor speed as well as eye-hand coordination during the followup of our patient after her teenage years. Visual reasoning and spatial orientation were mildly delayed, and the visuoconstructive skills were diminished. However, verbal skills had improved. Repetition of nonsense words and oromotor sequences were difficult for the proband because of verbal and oral dyspraxia, but the proband was able to learn and repeat long, logical stories. She had difficulties with time orientation.
Motor problems were evident but the symptoms had not progressed during the followup. The proband was able to walk on the toes and sides of the feet, but the forward tandem walk was insecure, and motor persistence and motor coordination were clumsy. Static cerebellar tests were performed quite well, with only slight problems with balance. Two of the dynamic cerebellar tests—finger-to-thumb tapping and toe tapping—were performed slowly but correctly. Visuomotor deficits were evident, but the proband managed the test of basic functional mobility quite well.
Brain imaging performed at 15 years of age showed dysmyelination. The corpus callosum was hypoplastic, but the cerebellum, pons, and the proximal part of the cervical cord were normal. There was no enlargement of the ventricles or signs of cortical atrophy. The MRI findings at 30 years of age were mild ().","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [157.0, 'cm']}",49.665,47.182,52.148,"The patient's gender is Female.

She was short in stature and of normal weight, measuring 144.7 cm (<3rd percentile) and weighing 44 kg (3rd-5th percentile). She showed no signs of TS, such as webbed neck, short neck, cubitus valgus, high arched palate, and shield chest deformity, except for short stature. Her menstrual cycle was regular. Tanner stage was breast 5 and pubic hair 5. She had normal intelligence and high grades in school.
The laboratory profiles demonstrated normal complete blood count, chemistry panel, and electrolytes. The thyroid function test showed: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.01 mIU/L (reference, 0.25-4.0 mIU/L); free thyroxine, 7.3 ng/dL (reference, 0.7-2.0 ng/dL); triiodothyronine, 680 ng/dL (reference, 60-190 ng/dL), thyroglobuin antibody, 7.06 U/mL (reference, 0-0.3 U/mL); thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin, 22.7% (reference, 0%-15%); microsomal antibody, 1.45 U/mL (reference, 0-0.3 U/mL), suggesting Graves disease. On thyroid ultrasonography, enlargement of both thyroid glands with increased vascularity was observed. A Technetium-99m thyroid scan showed diffuse, enlarged thyroid glands with markedly increased uptake. Other results were as follows: luteinizing hormone (LH), 14.65 mIU/mL (reference: follicular phase, 0.6-6.2 mIU/mL; luteal phase, 0-6.0 mIU/mL); follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), 7.78 mIU/mL (reference: follicular phase, 3.3-8.8 mIU/mL; luteal phase, 1.6-8.7 mIU/mL); and estradiol, 156.99 pg/mL (reference: follicular phase, 60-200 pg/mL; luteal phase, 60-260 pg/mL), without evidence of ovarian failure. Because the final height was below the 3rd percentile with coexisting thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity, chromosome analysis was performed. The karyotype was 46,X,del(X)(p22.1), one of the form of TS (). Methimazole was prescribed for the patient and a regular thyroid function test was performed.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [44.0, 'kg']}",84.0,79.8,88.2,"The patient's weight is 44.0 kg.

The QT interval is 330 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/149 = 0.403.

Patient was living in Jizan, an endemic area of malaria, which raised suspicion of malaria infection. Patient looked unwell, conscious, and alert. His vital signs were normal except the temperature which was high (38.5 degree C). Chest examination was normal and the cardiovascular system showed normal first and second heart sounds with no added sound. Fundus examination was normal. Other systemic reviews were unremarkable. Patient was admitted in the medical ward, and baseline laboratory investigations revealed the following remarkable laboratory values: white blood cells 12 × 109/L (normal range: 4.5 to 11.0 × 109/L); hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL (normal range: 13.8 to 17.2 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume 72 fL/red cell (normal range: 80–96 fL/red cell); platelet count 62 × 103/μL (normal range: 150–400 × 103/μL); reticulocyte 2.6% (normal range: 0.5% to 2.5%); aspartate transaminase 89 U/L (normal range: 10 to 40 U/L); alanine transaminase 78 U/L (normal range: 7 to 56 U/L); total bilirubin 600 μmol/L (normal range: 1.71 to 20.5 μmol/L); direct bilirubin 200 μmol/L (normal range: less than 5.1 μmol/L); and sodium 149 mmol/L (normal range: 136–145 mmol/L), whereas the following laboratory values were found to be in normal ranges: alkaline phosphatase 120 IU/L (normal range: 44 to 147 IU/L); random blood glucose 7.2 mmol/L (normal range: 4.4–8.9 mmol/L); potassium 4.9 mmol/L (normal range: 3.6–5.2 mmol/L); magnesium 0.9 mmol/L (normal range: 0.6–1.1 mmol/L); calcium 2.3 mmol/L (normal range: 2.2–2.7 mmol/L); phosphate 1.4 mmol/L (normal range: 1.12–1.45 mmol/L); creatinine 78 mmol/L (normal range: 60–110 mmol/L); and urea 3.7 mmol/L (normal range: 2.5–7.1 mmol/L).
ECG initially showed normal sinus rhythm, and chest X-ray was normal. The patient had no previous history of cardiac arrhythmias, and his baseline ECG was normal (). Peripheral blood smear revealed P. falciparum (ring form) with parasitemia index 10%. His body weight was 74 kg and height 166 cm.
Patient was diagnosed with severe P. falciparum malaria based on clinical presentation and laboratory investigations and started on intravenous artesunate 170 mg (2.4 mg/kg) bolus slowly over 2 minutes at 0 hour, 12 hours, and 24 hours, and every 24 hours thereafter for 5 days. The powder for injection was reconstituted with 5% sodium bicarbonate and diluted in an equal volume of normal saline. He was started on paracetamol 500 mg tablet orally as needed every 6 hours. Patient was clinically improving and temperature subsided. After 4 hours of the third dose of artesunate, the patient became sick, faint, and suddenly arrested. Resuscitation was done for 32 minutes, ECG was done and showed wide complex ventricular tachycardia, and QTc (Bazett) was 516 msec (). Electrolytes were in the normal limits: sodium 136 mmol/L; potassium 4.3 mmol/L; magnesium 0.8 mmol/L; and calcium 2.1 mmol/L. Tachycardia was managed by administration of amiodarone (150 mg i.v. for 10 minutes). The patient revived and kept in ICU for further observation. There was no worsening of hemolytic anemia during and after the treatment with artesunate. The treatment plan was not changed; the next dose of artesunate was after 24 hours of the third dose (last dose given before event happened). The patient clinically improved, fever subsided, and the temperature decreased with paracetamol to 37.4°C, and he was walking and conversing normally. The treatment was completed by oral artesunate 100 mg + sulfadoxine 500 mg/pyrimethamine 25 mg tablets (3-day course).","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [19, 'years'], 'weight': [74.0, 'kg'], 'height': [166.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [78.0, 'mmol/L']}",0.128,0.122,0.134,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 19 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 78.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from mmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 78.0 mmol. To convert 78.0 mmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 78.0 mmol creatinine * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.078 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.078 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 8.823 g creatinine. To convert 8.823 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 8.823 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 8823.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 8823.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 882.3 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 78.0 mmol creatinine/L converts to 882.3 mg creatinine/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 166.0 cm, which is 166.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.66 m. The patient's weight is 74.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 74.0 kg / (1.66 m * 1.66 m) = 26.854 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 26.9, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 166.0 cm, which is 166.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 65.354 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (65.354 (in inches) - 60) = 62.314 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 62.314 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 62.314 kg + 0.4 * (74.0 kg  - 62.314 kg) = 66.988 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 66.988 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 19) * 66.988 * 1) / (882.3 * 72) = 0.128 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 0.128 mL/min."

He had neither a personal nor family history of notable illness such as thrombotic diseases. One month previously, he had presented with bilateral leg edema. Two weeks before admission, he had been diagnosed with massive proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia in another clinic. His weight had increased by approximately 8 kg in 1 month.
Physical examination on admission revealed the following: height 168 cm, weight 61.6 kg, blood pressure 124/75 mm Hg, pulse rate 80 beats/min with a regular rhythm, and temperature 36.4°C. The lungs were clear and heart sounds were normal. Massive symmetrical leg edema was observed. There was no rash, lymphadenopathy, or joint swelling. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Urine sediment analysis revealed 5–9 red blood cells per high power field. Urinary protein excretion was 11.8 g/24 h. Blood analysis, biochemical and serological examination showed a white blood cell count of 7.7 × 103/μl, hemoglobin 15.4 g/dl, platelet count 315 × 103/μl, total protein 3.7 g/dl, albumin 0.8 g/dl, urea nitrogen 15 mg/dl, creatinine 0.96 mg/dl, uric acid 5.8 mg/dl, total cholesterol 460 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1c 5.7%, IgG 213 mg/dl, IgA 320 mg/dl, and IgM 57 mg/dl. Serum electrophoresis revealed no monoclonal peak. The third and fourth components of complement were within the normal limits. Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor activity, hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus were all negative. There was a marked elevation in fibrinogen (658.9 mg/dl) and d-dimer (3.1 μg/ml), and a decrease in antithrombin III activity (66.3%). Prothrombin time, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time were all normal. A fecal occult blood test, computed tomography (CT) through the chest and abdomen, and upper endoscopy did not suggest the presence of malignancy.
Because our patient initially refused renal biopsy, he was empirically treated with 40 mg/day of prednisolone from the third day after admission, together with continuous intravenous infusion of heparin for prophylaxis of thrombotic complications. However, he presented no clinical improvement and then received a percutaneous renal biopsy on day 34. The specimen consisted of 18 glomeruli showing diffuse and irregular thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with deposition of IgG4, compatible to idiopathic membranous nephropathy stage II. During prednisolone treatment, he developed a gradually progressive swelling of the upper and lower left arm. Levofloxacin was administrated because phlegmon in the upper extremity was considered, but the swelling worsened. Contrast-enhanced CT on day 54 showed obstructions of the left internal jugular vein and the left subclavian vein by large thrombi (fig. ). No anatomical abnormality in the venous system was observed. The blood levels of protein C, protein S, and β2-glycoprotein I were within the normal ranges. In addition to the heparin infusion, oral warfarin was added, with prothrombin time-international normalized ratio monitoring between 2 and 3. Edema of the patient's left upper limbs gradually improved and disappeared within 1 month. After his discharge on day 98, the edema completely disappeared.

Acro-osteolysis was seen. The bone age was equal to his chronological age. Audiometry showed mild to moderate bilateral conductive hearing loss.
Fundus examination showed bilateral vitreous hyperplasia with lots of fibrous bands.
He was diagnosed as Pycnodysostosis based on characteristic clinical and radiological findings.
The parents of the child were offered an option for CTSK gene mutation testing for confirmation of diagnosis of pycnodysostosis, however they refused for same in view of financial constraints as the same testing is not available currently in our country (India).
We suggest for active screening of all children diagnosed with pycnodysostosis for hearing defects and ophthalmological evaluation as similar evaluation was not seen previously in published literature.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

3888,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7422010-1,Extracted,"A 19-year-old male presented to the emergency room as a level 1 trauma with a self-inflicted GSW to the abdomen. The patient was attempting to put his 380 caliber handgun on safety when it discharged. On physical exam, the patient's abdomen was rigid and tender with a presumed entry point in the periumbilical area () and a presumed exit point in the left posterior superior buttock (). No other injuries were present. The patient's measurements included a height of 165 cm and a weight of 60.1 kg (BMI 22.1). The vital signs upon arrival were BP 132/66 mmHg, pulse 106 bpm, and GCS 15/15. The patient's blood pressure decreased slightly to 101/45 mmHg; however, this corrected with intravenous (IV) fluids.
Computed tomography (CT) was performed and showed a mild amount of free fluid and air in the abdomen and pelvis (). There was no evidence of great vessel injury. Given the known trajectory of the bullet and lack of severity in the CT findings, diagnostic laparoscopy was pursued with readiness to convert to laparotomy if necessary.
An initial periumbilical incision was made, and the abdomen was entered through a 5 mm port utilizing the Optiview technique. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained to 15 mmHg. Upon laparoscopic entrance, a small amount of blood and stool was noted in the left lower quadrant (). Additional ports were placed in the left lower quadrant (5 mm port) and right upper quadrant (11 mm port), both using the same optical trocar insertion method. Initial inspection of the sigmoid colon revealed a perforation with minimal contamination from stool spillage (). This was cleared and washed out followed by intracorporeal repair using 2-0 V-Loc™ suture in a running fashion done in 2 layers (). A second sigmoid perforation was found in the 4-5 cm distal to the first perforation as was repaired in a similar fashion (Figures and ). The sigmoid was followed systematically to the pelvis, and a rectal wall laceration was noted (). It was found to penetrate the serosa and muscle layer but lack mucosal involvement. This was again repaired using 2-0 V-Loc™ suture in 2 layers (). After advancing down the rectum, a laceration was noted in the peritoneum over where the bladder was located (). Of note, preoperative urinary catheterization yielded hematuria and this laparoscopic finding confirmed bladder injury. The on-call urologist was contacted intraoperatively, and it was agreed upon for the primary surgeon to repair it in 2 layers with 2-0 V-Loc™ sutures and leave a Foley in place for 2 weeks postoperatively (Figures and ). The colon was then systematically examined proximally including the rest of the sigmoid, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon, and cecum with no additional injuries noted. The ileocecal valve was identified; the small bowel was then run from the terminal ileum proximally. Another perforation was found approximately midsmall bowel with an enterotomy measuring less than 1 cm in size (). This was closed in 2 layers using 2-0 V-Loc™ suture (). The rest of the small bowel was run up to the ligament of Treitz with no additional injuries found. Of note, all the mesentery was examined while running the bowels with no significant injuries noted. All solid organs were intact on inspection. After abdominal and pelvic washout was performed, a size 19 French Blake drain was placed in the pelvis exiting through the left lower quadrant port site.
The GSW to the abdominal wall itself was examined. The bullet trajectory was angled in such a way that when it penetrated the skin, there was about a 5 cm difference from the presumed skin entry point and peritoneum entry point. Given this tangential path, the wound was not closed due to a low risk of herniation. The tract was thoroughly irrigated. Port sites were closed and dressings were placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit following extubation.
Postoperatively, the patient was placed in the surgical intensive care unit. There he progressed well and remained NPO with a NG tube in place. A urologist recommended the Foley catheter remains in place for 7 to 10 days with a cystogram done prior to removal. The patient was started on ertapenem upon his arrival and remained on IV antibiotics throughout his admission. Repeat CT with oral, rectal, and IV contrast on POD 5 was negative for any occult injury or contrast leak. Following this, the patient was started on a clear liquid diet with progression to full liquids. The patient was tolerating this well and was having normal bowel movements. He was advanced to a soft diet the following day. The patient's drain remained serosanguineous in nature and was able to be removed. The patient was discharged home on POD 6 with a Foley catheter in place, which was removed by a urologist 5 days later.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [165.0, 'cm']}",61.41,58.339,64.48,"The patient's gender is Male.

5478,26,Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia,lab test,decimal,pmc-3858703-1,Extracted,"A 68-year-old male patient was admitted with complaints of pain in the left eye associated with redness for 3 days, nasal block with discharge for 5 days, breathlessness for 10 days, and cough with expectoration for 10 days. He was diagnosed to have fungal rhino sinusitis (mucormycosis), orbital cellulitis (mucormycosis), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and nephropathy. He was on treatment with insulin for diabetes, tablet ecospirin for ischemic heart disease, and injection amphotericin for fungal rhino sinusitis. He was proposed for left orbital exenteration surgery. On examination, the patient was drowsy. His pulse rate was 86/min, irregular in rhythm, and blood pressure measured in right arm in supine position was 100/60 mm Hg. There was swelling of left eye with discharge. Cardiovascular system examination showed split in second heart sound. Respiratory system examination showed bilateral extensive rhonchi and rales. Oxygen saturation on room air was 91-92%. Airway examination showed modified Mallampati score of 3. His fasting blood glucose was 409 mg/dl and random glucose level was 329 mg/dl. His hemoglobin was 10.7 gm/dl, blood urea was 92 mg/dl, and serum creatinine was 2.0 mg/dl. Serum sodium level was 133 mEq/L and potassium level was 3.5 mEq/L. ECG showed right bundle branch block pattern and Q wave in leads V1–V3. Echocardiography showed global hypokinesia of left ventricle with left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, dilated cardiac chambers with apical clot in the right ventricle, and sclerosed aortic valve. Chest radiography showed features of cardiomegaly and congestive cardiac failure. Computed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal sinuses with orbit showed pan sinusitis and left orbital cellulitis with no intracranial extension. Considering the risk factors like congestive cardiac failure, sepsis, inadequate control of blood sugar, renal failure, and ischemic heart disease with poor left ventricular ejection fraction, grave risk consent was taken. All standard monitors like pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and ECG, were connected. Intravenous access was obtained with 18 G cannula. Oxygen was administered through nasal prongs.
The patient was placed in supine position with the head in neutral position and the eyes staring straight ahead. The anatomic landmark was marked at a point 3 cm lateral to the angle of the mouth on the left side. The skin over the cheek on the involved site was prepared with povidone-iodine and draped. A skin wheal was raised with a local anesthetic. A 22G, 10 cm-long spinal needle was inserted here [] and advanced upward toward the mandibular condyle in a plane lining with the patient's pupil as the patient's eyes stared ahead, and the trajectory was cephalad toward the external auditory meatus. At a depth of 5 cm, the greater wing of the sphenoid at the base of the skull was contacted. The needle was withdrawn and redirected more posteriorly to enter the foramen ovale. It was then advanced 1.5 cm. Paresthesia at the mandible was elicited, followed by paresthesia in the maxilla and orbit. Before injecting the local anesthetic, the needle was carefully aspirated to check for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 2 ml of lignocaine 2% with 5 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% was given. Supraorbital and supratrochlear block was given with 0.5% bupivacaine 3 ml each. Intravenous sedation was given with midazolam 1 mg and morphine 3 mg. Patient was monitored all the time during surgery. Oxygen saturation was between 97% and 98%, blood pressure was ranging from 100/60 to 110/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was between 90/min and 106/min. The patient was specifically monitored for signs of an oculo-cardiac reflex. A standard exenteration was performed and the patient tolerated the procedure well with no episodes of hypoxia or bradycardia. The patient was comfortable during surgery. Blood sugar was controlled with insulin 5 U bolus and at an infusion rate of 2U/h. Blood sugar was between 170 and 220 mg/dl. Postoperatively pain was controlled with injection tramadol 50 mg tid.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [409.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [133.0, 'mEq/L']}",140.416,133.395,147.437,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.

8649,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-4252347-1,Extracted,"A 65-year-old male, with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 (163 cm, 80 kg), was admitted with dyspnea on exertion. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft for treatment of angina pectoris. His past medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebral infarction. Preoperative electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block, but there were no other abnormalities on preoperative examination.
The patient's vital signs after arrival in the operating room were blood pressure (BP) 140/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 70 beats/min, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100%. An arterial catheter was inserted via the left radial artery for continuous BP monitoring. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous etomidate 14 mg, rocuronium 50 mg, and fentanyl 200 ug.
The patient's head was rotated leftward 20-30° in head-down position for insertion of a triple-lumen 7-Fr CVC (Bioline, Ewha Biomedics, Seoul, Korea) via the right IJV, but the anatomical landmarks were not clearly distinguished. After additional rotation of the head to 30°, the triangle consisting of the two heads of the SCM muscle and the clavicle was recognized and the pulsation of the ICA was felt from the superior angle of this triangle. A 23 G finder needle was inserted at a 30° angle in the site where both bellies of the SCM joined and the pulsation of the ICA was about 0.5 cm distinct, and was advanced toward the ipsilateral nipple. Non-pulsatile blood was aspirated at a depth of 3.0 cm. After removal of the finder needle, an 18 G puncture needle was inserted in the same direction, but venous blood was not aspirated at a depth of over 4.0 cm. Under the presumption that the thick puncture needle might lead to a collapsed IJV, the needle was drawn back while aspirating. Immediately after the needle was pulled back, non-pulsatile dark-colored blood flow was observed. As the J-tipped guide wire was advanced to 25 cm from the skin surface, the ECG monitor showed arrhythmia, and the wire was withdrawn about 5 cm. The CVC was then inserted and fixed at 14 cm after confirming free regurgitation of blood. Central venous pressure (CVP) was measured to be 9 or 10 mmHg, and the withdrawn wire had no deformities. A chest X-ray was performed to confirm the location of the CVC.
According to the radiologist's reading of the chest X-ray, the CVC passed the transverse processes of the 6th and 7th cervical vertebrae (). Longitudinal view from the ultrasound (according to the course of the CVC) showed that the catheter was closely passing the right wall of the IJV and proceeding deep (). However, the exact location of the catheter tip could not be identified. Axial view of the IJV showed that the catheter shadow was located not in the vein but in the deeper posterior part (). The catheter was placed in neither the ipsilateral ICA nor the subclavian vein. Taking the ultrasound and chest X-ray into consideration, it was presumed that the CVC had been inserted into a vein other than the IJV. A new catheter was placed in the right subclavian vein under ultrasound guidance. Longitudinal view showed that the catheter proceeded along the right subclavian vein. Tip position in the SVC was confirmed by transesophageal ultrasound. The misplaced catheter was maintained along with the newly inserted CVC during the surgery (), due to the possibility of hemorrhage induced by intraoperative heparin administration. The operation was performed with no complications.
Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The bleeding from the surgical site was minimal, and the activated clotting time was 119 seconds. The misplaced catheter was removed. Physical examination revealed no hematoma or bruit at the puncture site after 15 minutes of compression. The patient was extubated the following day and transferred to the general ward. He did not experience any neurologic symptoms and was discharged on the 14th day after the operation.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [80.0, 'kg'], 'height': [163.0, 'cm']}",67.759,64.371,71.147,"The patient's gender is Male.

Proteinuria had been detected when the patient was approximately 30 years of age, and he had experienced tonsillitis several times. The patient had been diagnosed with PV with an abnormality of the JAK2 gene 3 years earlier. Renal biopsy was planned because his proteinuria had become more apparent over the past 2 years.
The patient’s height, weight, and blood pressure were 165 cm, 66 kg, and 120/73 mmHg, respectively. His consciousness level was alert, and he appeared healthy. No remarkable abnormalities were found in the heart, lungs, or abdomen, and pitting edema was not observed.
The laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 15.3 g/dl; hematocrit, 48.1 %; platelets, 326,000/μl; white blood cells, 8,400/μl; C-reactive protein, <0.2 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 22.2 mg/dl; serum creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; total cholesterol, 194 mg/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; albumin, 4.1 g/dl; globulin, 3.0 g/dl; lactate dehydrogenase, 169 IU/l; aspartate aminotransferase, 17 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase, 23 IU/l; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dl; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 21 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 276 IU/l; Na, 139 mmol/l; K, 4.7 mmol/l; and Cl, 106 mmol/l. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria (1.2 g/day) and no evidence of hematuria.
Renal biopsy was performed (Fig. ) and 22 glomeruli could be evaluated, 5 of which showed global sclerosis. Histological findings included mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents and focal segmental necrosis. Arteriosclerotic changes were also observed. Immunofluorescence staining was positive and revealed strong immunoreactivity for IgA and C3. Electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in the mesangium. He was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. Tonsillectomy plus steroid pulse therapy and an angiotensin II receptor blocker were selected as treatments for the patient.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 51 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.

The current presentation was preceded by two previous episodes of illness in which he had reported similar symptoms along with haemoptysis in April and July 2014. Past medical history revealed the presence of a peripapilary melanoma of the left eye treated with radiotherapy in 2010 and a basal cell carcinoma of the mid-back excised in 2000. The patient denied tobacco use and drank occasionally and denied any family history off kidney disease. He worked on a farm and was married with two children. On presentation his blood pressure was 124/70 mmHg, weight 91 kg, and there was evidence of macular rash on his back but no lower limb oedema. Urine evaluation demonstrated activity with 3+ protein and 3+ blood, and his serum creatinine was elevated at 128 μmol/L compared to a baseline of 116 μmol/L recorded in April 2014. Serology was positive for P-ANCA with a titre of 160 and he had an anti-MPO titre of over 200 units/mL; apart from this ANA was positive with a titre of 1600 with negative Anti-dsDNA, Anti-Sm, Anti-Sm/RNP and Anti-SSB/RO/LA; Serology for HIV 1 + 2 Ag/Ab and Hepatitis BsAg & Hepatitis C antibody were negative; complement levels were within normal range C3 of 0.82 g/L and C4 of 0.24 g/L. ESR was 30 mm/h and Hs-CRP was 48 mg/L; rest of his routine bloods were unremarkable (White cell count 5.8 × 109/L, haemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, neutrophils 4.00 × 109/L, platelet 210 × 109/L, sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, total protein 69 g/L, albumin 39 g/L, serum calcium 2.31 mmol/L, serum phosphate 1.09 mmol/L, bilirubin 7.3 µmol/L, alkaline phosphatase 81 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase 25 IU/L, alanine-aminotransferase 39 IU/L, prothrombin time 12.0 s, activated partial thromboplastin time 32.0 s). Chest X-ray was normal. A recent ultrasound of his kidneys demonstrated normal size and shape with normal cortex. A native kidney biopsy revealed evidence of moderate arteriosclerosis with 30–35% fibrosis, areas of thrombotic microangiopathy but without evidence of fibrinoid necrosis or epithelial crescents. Immunofluorescence was negative and electron microscopy revealed thin glomerular basement membranes with mean measurements less than 250 nM and many measurements less than 200 nM, consistent with thin basement membrane disease (TBMD).
Based on the presence of an AKI with active urine sediment, associated skin rash, and positive serology with high titres of P-ANCA and anti-MPO along with an antecedent history of haemoptysis, we diagnosed an ANCA-associated vasculitis likely microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) based on the European Medicines Agency Algorithm, although the kidney biopsy sample failed to demonstrate classical features of renal vasculitis []. Treatment was initiated with corticosteroids and intravenous rituximab infusions (at day 0 and day 18) with prophylaxis for pneumocystis (co-trimoxazole), osteoporosis (oral Vitamin D3 and bisphosphonates), and gastritis (proton pump inhibitor). Four weeks later his urine sediment normalised with no detectable blood or protein; his CRP fell to < 5 mg/L and his ANCA titres fell to 40 but his anti-MPO level remained remarkably high 198 IU/mL. Two months later, he developed severe depression attributed to steroids requiring taper and the initiation of anti-psychotic therapy.
Six months following initial presentation, his vasculitis remained clinically quiescent and the patient was commenced on azathioprine (AZA) as a steroid sparing agent for maintenance immunosuppression. Two weeks after AZA commencement, the patient presented to the emergency department with acute painful disseminated morbilliform rash along with fever and myalgia. On examination temp was 39.7 °C and a widespread indurated erythematous papular rash was noted (Fig. a, b). An extensive viral and immunologic work up was negative including virology for herpes zoster, and simplex. Considering his history of immunosuppression he was empirically started on acyclovir. Full blood count revealed neutrophilic leucocytosis with neutrophil count of 12.2 × 109/L, Hs-CRP 259 and ESR 59, and a stable serum creatinine concentration of 115 μmol/L. A full septic work up was negative including negative serology for HIV, hepatitis A, B, C, and CMV. A skin biopsy was diagnostic of Sweet’s syndrome, in which the affected lesions revealed extensive neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis but without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, herpes, zoster, or erythema multiform. Azathioprine was stopped and the patient was treated with oral prednisolone (30 mg once daily followed by a steroid taper) and colchicine (500 mcg twice daily) []. Within 4 weeks, the rash had completely resolved (Fig. c, d) and his inflammatory markers normalised. As the onset of symptoms were temporally related to initiation of AZA, a diagnosis of drug-induced Sweet syndrome. His steroid dose was tapered gradually to zero and treatment with colchicine was continued. As of August 2017, his vasculitis remains quiescent and there has been no recurrence of Sweet syndrome, however his ANCA titres remain elevated with anti-MPO levels 170 RU/mL.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

His only past medical history was untreated hypertension, and he had had no episode of blood coagulation abnormality. He was not taking any medication, and no significant family history was noted. When he arrived at our hospital, he was alert (Glasgow Coma Scale score 15), and he had no paralysis. Although his circulatory dynamics were almost stable, he was diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). The aortic dissection extended to the abdominal aorta, left common iliac artery, and brachiocephalic artery; however, the persistence of perioperative malperfusion was not confirmed by CT. Thus, emergency aortic arch replacement surgery was scheduled. Before the surgery, there was no pericardial effusion and no major aortic valve regurgitation detected by transthoracic echocardiography, and the patient’s electrocardiogram revealed no abnormality. The results of arterial blood gas analysis were within the normal ranges, except for an increase in lactate of 4.60 mmol/L. Although the patient had no clinical bleeding tendency, a blood test prior to surgery showed coagulopathy: platelet count (PLT) 117 × 109/L, prothrombin time–international normalized ratio (PT-INR) 1.78, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 69.7 seconds, fibrinogen < 50 mg/dl, and D-dimer 1560 μg/ml.
General anesthesia was induced with midazolam 5 mg, fentanyl 200 μg, and rocuronium 50 mg and maintained with sevoflurane 1.5% or midazolam (during cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB]), intermittent administration of fentanyl (total 600 μg), remifentanil 0.15–0.3 μg/kg/minute, and rocuronium. During the surgery, an electrocardiogram, left radial and left dorsal pedis arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, central venous pressure, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) (INVOS 5100C; Medtronic, Boulder, CO, USA), bispectral index, and transesophageal echocardiography were monitored. Left and right rSO2 values before the induction of anesthesia were 74% and 75%, respectively.
A smaller-than-usual dose (8000 IU) of heparin was administered because activated clotting time (ACT) prior to heparin administration was extremely prolonged (> 999 seconds). ACT was assessed by using the HMS Plus system (Medtronic). Then, the left femoral artery, right subclavian artery, left femoral vein, and superior venae cavae were cannulated to establish CPB (MERA exceline CPB circuit; SENKO MEDICAL INSTRUMENT, Tokyo, Japan). There were no clinical signs of coagulopathy during opening of the chest or cannulation.
Following establishment of CPB, the patient was cooled to 25 °C tympanic temperature. Perfusion pressure was maintained at approximately 60 mmHg during CPB. Hemiarch replacement (replacement of the ascending aorta, proximal aortic arch, and right innominate artery) was performed by using the open distal anastomosis technique under circulatory arrest with brain protection by antegrade selective cerebral perfusion. The circulatory arrest time was 49 minutes. Moreover, aortic root replacement (Bentall procedure) was performed after reestablishing CPB via the graft anastomosed to the distal end. During the surgical procedure, the rSO2 value was maintained between 60% and 75%. ACT assessed every 30–60 minutes after the first heparin administration was unchanged, being > 999 seconds; therefore, additional heparin was not administered during surgery. There was no clinical problem during CPB.
After the CPB, 720 ml of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and protamine sulfate 200 mg were administered, then ACT decreased to 159 seconds. Moreover, oozing persisted after first administration of FFP and protamine; thus, 1200 ml of FFP, 800 ml of platelet concentrates (PC), fibrinogen concentrate 3 g, and tranexamic acid 2 g were needed after the CPB for hemostasis, and ACT was 137 seconds at the end of surgery. The bilateral rSO2 gradually decreased from the end of CPB and was approximately 40% at the end of surgery. The CPB time was 492 minutes; the operative time was 667 minutes; the anesthesia time was 739 minutes; the intraoperative urine volume was 1185 ml; and the bleeding volume was approximately 5500 ml. After the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with artificial respiration.
A blood test performed soon after the surgery showed the following values: PLT 123 × 109/L, PT-INR 1.52, APTT 38.3 seconds, fibrinogen 124 mg/dl, and D-dimer 116 μg/ml. After arrival in the ICU, bleeding from the drains in the pericardial cavity continued, and red blood cells and FFP were administered. On the first postoperative day (POD 1), dilation of the pupils and loss of light reflex were observed. A head CT indicated diffuse cerebral edema, and a diagnosis of global cerebral infarction was made. Although FFP and PC were administered on an as-needed basis from POD 1 to POD 7, ACT had been prolonged to approximately 150–200 seconds without using heparin. An additional blood coagulation test performed at POD 9 (Table ) indicated FXII deficiency (8.0%). At this point, global cerebral infarction was confirmed, and a poor prognosis was expected. Therefore, with written informed consent from the family of the patient, additional intervention for FXII deficiency was not performed. The patient died on POD 14.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [170.0, 'cm']}",65.937,62.64,69.234,"The patient's gender is Male.

After an orthopedic examination, she was diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans type 3 and an arthroscopic surgery was scheluded.
Aside from this complaint, the patient had a diagnosis of OSA who had been followed for two years and had a diagnosis of MS who had been followed for 3 years. Her complaints included hoarseness, urinary incontinance, difficulty during walking, dyplopia, dizziness, anxiety, headache and hypoesthesia in both lower legs. No cardiac problem was found after cardiologic assessment. An MRI study has revealed plaque formations in right frontal lobe, bilateral centrum semiovale, medulla oblangata and Th1 and Th2 levels of medulla spinalis.
The patient had also sleeping disorders and snoring. Her height was 161 cm, weight was 93 kg, body mass index was 35.87 and neck circumference was 39 cm with a Mallampati class III airway. Her apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was found as 22.36 after an polysomnographic examination. She had used thioridazine, escitalopram and risperidone for depressive disorder in the past, however she hasn’t took any medication for six months at that time.
Before the scheluded operation, she had been instructed to use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask at nights for two months. After this period, AHI value decreased from 22.36 to 8.20. Her preoperative laboratory tests was in normal range except a mild high leukocyte count (12,000 cells/mm3).
General anesthesia was planned for anesthetic approach (). After admission to the operating room, an IV cannula was inserted and ECG, NIBP, and SpO2 was monitored. An axillary probe and oesophageal probe was used for temperature monitoring. Anesthesia was induced with 0.2 mg/kg midazolam and 0.1 mg/kg fentanyl, after preoxygenation for 3 minutes with 100% oxygen. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was given to facilitate intubation. Following endotracheal intubation, 1.8% sevoflurane in 50% N2O-O2 mixture was used for maintenance of anaesthesia. Duration of operation was 55 minutes. No reversal agent was given. Extubation was performed after the spontaneous ventilation was completely returned and CPAP mask was performed just after the extubation. After 30 minutes care at postanesthesia care unit (PACU), she was discharged to the intermediate care unit while her vital signs and body temperature was stable. A demand-only IV-PCA with tramadol was used for postoperative pain control for 24 hours. No MS symptoms was observed clinically and no MRI findings related with MS was seen postoperatively.
Eighteen months after the first operation, the patient was hospitalised for incomplete abortus and scheluded for dilation and curettage. Preoperative blood examination was normal except a leucocyte count of 15,400 cells/mm3. Patient kept using CPAP mask preoperatively. Her complaints were the same as before indicating no MS exacerbation. On the operation room, she was monitored by ECG, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature. After an IV cannulation, she was preoxygenated for 3 minutes with 100% oxygen. For anesthesia induction 0.2 mg/kg midazolam and 0.1 mg/kg fentanyl was used. During 20 minutes of operation, mask ventilation was performed and spontaneous breathing was supported. Operating room temperature and body temperature was kept constant during the operation. CPAP mask was also performed after the extubation. She transferred to intermediate care unit after a care period of 30 minutes at PACU. No MS symptoms was observed after the operation.
One year after the second operation, the patient complained of pain on the right foot. After an examination by orthopaedic surgeons, an arthroscopic surgery was planned for a diagnosis of osteochondritis dissecans type 4. In preoperative evaluation, respiratory care physician performed a respiratory function test and found that FVC was 99%, FEV1 was 92% and FEV1/FVC was 98%. Patient also kept using CPAP mask during this time. Neurological examination did not reveal any pathologic finding suggesting an MS attack. Preoperative blood tests was normal. In the operation room, an IV route was established and ECG, NIBP, SpO2 and body temperature was monitored. After preoxygenisation for 3 minutes with 100% oxygen, anesthetic induction was made with 0.3 mg/kg midazolam. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with 0.5 mg/kg atracurium. For maintenance of anesthesia 1.5% sevoflurane in 50% N2O-O2 mixture was used. At the end of the operation no reversal agent was given. Extubation was done after complete recovery of spontaneous ventilation and a CPAP mask was instituted. Vital signs were observed for 30 min at PACU and she then transferred to intermediate care unit. A demand-only IV-PCA with tramadol was used for postoperative pain control for 24 hours.
In all surgeries, dalteparine 2500 IU/0.2 ml was used preoperatively for thrombophylaxis. No arrhythmia, apnea, and oxygen desaturation was seen in perioperative period and she was kept in semi-upright position at PACU and intermediate care unit in all operations.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [93.0, 'kg'], 'height': [161.0, 'cm']}",69.173,65.714,72.632,"The patient's gender is Female.

He also had progressive difficulty in ambulating and an unusual pain sensation in both lower extremities. Furthermore, the patient had frequently experienced stumbling and falls. He had no history of any significant trauma, family history of spinal disease, or past history of lumbar puncture prior to the onset of symptoms. Physical examination revealed a weight of 80 kg, height of 168 cm, and body mass index of 28.3 kg/m2, indicative of morbid obesity for this boy.
The neurologic examination revealed bilateral weakness of the lower extremities, especially upon knee extension with a Medical Research Council (MRC) grade of 2/5. The patient did not have significant sensory deficits in the lower extremities. His perineal sensation and anal tone were normal.
Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed a large CSF-filled, cystic mass without contrast enhancement located at the level of L2 to L5 causing severe thecal sac compression. The imaging findings indicated an extradural arachnoid cyst (). The thecal sac was severely flattened and displaced anteriorly.
The patient underwent an emergent laminectomy of L2–L4 and removal of cyst with meticulous suture of the dural defect.
After laminectomy, removal of the yellow ligament permitted the visualization of a huge cyst in the epidural space (). The cystic wall was thin and blue-colored with slight adhesions to the dura mater. During the careful dissection of the cystic membrane, a communicating tract and approximately 3 cm of dural defect with floating nerve rootlets were visualized. CSF leakage was also observed. Although the cyst was extended to the neural foramen, it was possible to remove the cystic membrane en bloc after fenestration of cyst. Microsurgical repair of the dural defect was performed, followed by the agglutination of a collagen fleece (Tachocomb®) and application of fibrin glue (Greenplast®) (). Postoperatively, the patient had no neurologic aggravation and his symptoms improved. A biopsy of the cyst wall membrane revealed a fibrocollagenous tissue consistent with an arachnoid cyst.

During transit he had two generalized seizures. On the admission the patient appeared confused but conscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13. He behaved aggressively and spoke neither English nor a local language. An interpreter was consulted, but the patient showed aggressive behaviour, therefore making it impossible to take a history. The physical examination was unremarkable except for a tongue bite and several bruises and scratches over the whole body. The pupils were moderately dilated and sluggishly reactive. All vital signs were stable (heart rate: 108 beats per minute, blood pressure: 123/80 mmHg, oxygen saturation: 98% at room air with a normal respiratory rate, and a body core temperature of 37.2°C).

Electrolytes, liver enzymes, troponin I, coagulation, and haematology were in the normal range. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia. Neurology service was consulted because of ongoing confusion and for assessment of epilepsy. A cranial CT scan ruled out haemorrhage or other focal lesions. Lorazepam (2 mg, IV) was administered twice with no effect on his neurological status. The patient started to sweat and became hypertensive (systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg) and more tachycardic (heart rate of 140/min). A drug screening (Triage 8) was performed, which was positive for cocaine. Finally he admitted the cocaine consumption but refused to give further information.

1077,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-5994706-1,Extracted,"An 85-year-old woman presented to hospital on 10 July with shortness of breath, fever and raised inflammatory markers and she was treated with levofloxacin for possible pneumonia. Her past medical history was notable for a tissue aortic valve replacement 11 years prior to this event, she had atrial fibrillation and was on apixaban and had hypertension and hypothyroidism.
Blood cultures taken 2 days after admission were negative and a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram showed bibasal pleural effusions thought to be parapneumonic in nature. Deterioration in her clinical condition and new febrile episodes prompted repeat blood cultures to be taken on 28 July and these were positive for Campylobacter fetus identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis after 3 days of incubation. She did not have any loose stools during her admission at any point and had no known contact with animals. She was treated with 3 days of azithromycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done and was reported as showing the prosthetic aortic valve was well seated with a preserved ejection fraction and mild diastolic dysfunction. She was discussed with the Cardiology team who felt that she did not warrant any further investigation as she did not display any features of endocarditis and her inflammatory markers had normalized, and she was discharged on 25 August.
She was then re-admitted on 6 September with multiple tonic-clonic seizures. In between episodes it was noticed she had a unilateral facial droop and had developed a fixed gaze. She was afebrile with a heart rate of 116 bpm and a blood pressure of 127/80 mmHg, and on examination it was noted that she had an audible ejection systolic murmur. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 23 mg l−1 on admission and she had a white cell count of 13.0 g l−1 in the context of recurrent seizures.
She was initially started on ceftriaxone 2 g twice daily and acyclovir as there were concerns regarding central nervous system infection. However, as she slowly began to recover it became evident that she had a persistent right-sided facial droop, hemianopia and right-sided hemiparesis. An electroencephalogram done on admission was consistent with a vascular insult in the left hemisphere and not encephalitis and ceftriaxone and acyclovir were stopped. An initial computed tomography (CT) scan showed severe small vessel disease and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan done on 10 September showed bilateral emboli in both cerebral hemispheres. The working diagnosis at this point was that the patient had a cerebrovascular event secondary to her atrial fibrillation and she was transferred to the stroke team.
Over the next 2 weeks her inflammatory markers started to climb and she started spiking temperatures to over 38 °C on 22 September and became less rousable. Aspiration pneumonia was suspected clinically and she was started on co-amoxiclav. Blood cultures were taken and were again positive 2 days later with C. fetus. As previously, the patient had no gastrointestinal symptoms. At this point clarithromycin was added pending MICs.
Given the repeatedly positive blood cultures, possibly septic emboli seen on MRI scan and prosthetic heart valve, endocarditis was strongly suspected. A repeat TTE on 26 September showed a significant change in the aortic valve appearance compared to the previous imaging, with thickening and restricted movement with possible thickening of the aortic root and an increase in the peak gradient to 67 mmHg although systolic function was maintained. It was felt that this warranted treatment for infective endocarditis due to C. fetus. A CT angiogram showed no evidence of aortitis but a possible wedge perfusion defect was noted in the spleen. She was not considered a surgical candidate and given her age, frailty and co-morbidities a transoesophageal echo was not performed.
MICs were determined and were as follows: amoxicillin 0.50 µg ml−1, meropenem 0.016 µg ml−1, azithromycin 0.125 µg ml−1, gentamicin 0.38 µg ml−1, tetracycline 0.75 µg ml−1 and ceftriaxone 3 µg ml−1. Based on this information the antibiotics were switched to intravenous (IV) amoxicillin 2 g every 4 h to complete 6 weeks for prosthetic valve endocarditis along with 2 weeks of synergistic gentamicin at 1 mg kg−1 twice daily. Repeat blood cultures taken on antibiotic treatment were negative.
The patient gradually improved, her temperatures normalized and her CRP dropped to 7mg l−1 . She remained in hospital to complete her antibiotic treatment and multiple repeat blood cultures were negative. She remained afebrile with normal inflammatory markers while in hospital for 3 weeks after completing her treatment and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on 28 November.

211,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-8334176-1,Extracted,"A 26-year-old man with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood and end-stage kidney failure due to IgA nephropathy received a deceased donor kidney transplant at the age of 21, mismatched for 3 HLA antigens (one mismatch in HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR). Two years after kidney transplantation (KTx), an indication biopsy for an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) levels showed a mixed T-cell rejection (Banff 4/IB) and acute AMR with positive donor-specific antibodies (DSA; anti-HLA DQB1 and DQA1) while receiving triple maintenance immunosuppressive regimen (tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil/steroid). The rejection was treated with high-dose steroids, antithymocyte globulin, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), and rituximab. After 3 years of stable kidney function with sCr in the range between 150 and 180 μmol/L, we observed a progressive deterioration of kidney function with a sCr value of 240 μmol/L and a 24-h proteinuria of 3.4 g/day before entering the study protocol. The kidney biopsy revealed chronic active AMR ().
Due to the history of childhood ALL, which was treated with a combination chemotherapy (vincristine, doxorubicine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine), we first performed a bone marrow aspiration, which showed non-specific reactive changes. The treatment protocols were approved by National Ethic Committee (approval no. 0120-215/2018/4). The written informed consent was obtained from the patient. After completion of the standard of care therapy (including corticosteroids, membrane plasmapheresis, and IVIg), the patient received MSCs therapy according to the study protocol, consisting of 3 x 106 cells/kg, applied at 1-week intervals. Details of the MSCs cultures and criteria for bench release are described in the Supplementary documentation ().
After the first dose of MSCs the patient reported short term nausea. One week later after the second dose of MSCs nausea, blepharitis and diarrhea developed, with their remission after 24 h. This was associated with a slight deterioration in kidney function, which we attributed to prerenal causes (). When the patient was referred for the third dose of MSCs (2 weeks after the first dose), the symptoms had completely disappeared. The evening after the third dose of MSCs was administered, the patient was admitted to the emergency department due to abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. A further deterioration of the kidney function was observed (sCr of 390 μmol/L), accompanied by newly developed ascites and abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Although indicators of inflammation remained normal throughout the course of treatment, the initial clinical presentation was suspicious for infection. Therefore, the manufacturing process of MSCs was reevaluated and contamination by infectious agents during cultivation or before release was ruled out. An expanded diagnostic investigation () ruled out common and opportunistic infections, including Herpes viruses 6, 7, and 8, CMV, HIV, and EBV viremia, bacteremia, gastrointestinal infections, and the possibility of intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome. Endoscopic biopsies of the colon and duodenum showed mucosal edema without inflammatory cell infiltration or apoptotic bodies. Given the normal concentrations of complement components and absence of fetal bovine albumin in the cell medium (platelet lysate was used instead), a serum disease-like syndrome did not seem likely. A capillary leak variant syndrome, associated with sudden capillary hyperpermeability, resulting edemas and hypoalbuminemia, was considered. Therefore, antihistamines and methylprednisolone were administered at a dosage of 1.5 mg per kg body weight. After administration of high-dose steroids, the symptoms disappeared, and the dose was reduced during the next 10 days. At this point, sCr stabilized in the range of 300 μmol/l.
Two weeks later (i.e., 5 weeks after the last dose of MSCs), there was a recurrence of abdominal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, ascites), this time followed by resistant hypertension, a further deterioration of kidney function (sCr of 380 μmol/l), an increase in proteinuria (7.3 g per day), and signs of hemolysis and pancytopenia. Tacrolimus trough levels were very low (<2 ng/ml), despite an increase of the dosage and assured adherence to therapy. The abdominal CT scan showed ascites, thickening of the intestinal wall (especially the jejunum), lymphadenopathy and an enlarged spleen. Transcriptomic analysis by the molecular microscope diagnostic system (MMDx) () of the subsequent kidney biopsy showed persistence of AMR, although the molecular classifiers of inflammation and AMR were lower compared to the biopsy before application of MSCs (inflammation score of 1.06 vs. 3.19, and AMR score of 0.63 vs. 0.94, respectively; ). In addition, the MFI levels of DSA decreased and we had no reason to assume a further deterioration of AMR.
Cytokine assessment after MSCs treatment (at the time of onset of symptoms) showed increased levels of IL-2R and IL-8, while other cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, were within near normal ranges and not consistent with a cytokine storm (, for details see ). Comparative analysis of T and B lymphocyte subsets before and after MSC therapy showed a transient decrease in all lymphocyte subsets with an increase in the ratio of activated T lymphocytes that occurred concomitantly with worsening of symptoms and the appearance of pancytopenia (). Bone marrow examination was consistent with trilineage dysplasia and a secondary myelodysplastic syndrome attributable to potentiated immunosuppressive therapy. It is more likely, however, that the changes in the bone marrow were of reactive origin. Morphologically, there was no evidence of parvovirus B19 infection of the bone marrow.
The kidney allograft failed 2 months after MSCs transplantation and hemodialysis was initiated. After administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and reintroduction of methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg, leukopenia improved minimally, and gastrointestinal symptoms worsened after each application of GCS-F. Therefore, the steroids and GCS-F were discontinued. The patient's general condition gradually deteriorated with progressive malaise, vomiting/diarrhea, generalized edema, and laboratory signs of hypoalbuminemia and agranulocytosis. The clinic's expert council made the empirical decision to end a life-threatening situation by removing the failed kidney transplant. After the transplant nephrectomy, the cell counts recovered almost instantly (). At this time, parvovirus B19 viremia was also detected. After treatment with high-dose IVIg, the parvovirus B19 infection resolved. Retrospectively, parvovirus B19 was detected by PCR in both the preimplantation kidney biopsy (6 years before MSC therapy) and in the kidney graft after MSC therapy. The patient is currently on chronic hemodialysis, remains aviremic and no further MSCs associated adverse events were observed during the 24-month follow-up period. Patohistologic analysis of the explanted kidney was consistent with advanced AMR, glomerular and vascular thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and extensive tubular injury ().","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [26, 'years'], 'creatinine': [240.0, 'µmol/L'], 'sex': 'Male'}",32.323,30.707,33.939,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 26 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 240.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 240.0 µmol. To convert 240.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 240.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00024 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00024 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.027 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.027 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.027 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 27.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 27.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 2.7 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 240.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 2.7 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (2.7/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**26 * 1.0 = 32.323.
Hence, the GFR value is 32.323 ml/min/1.73 m²."
3258,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-3731623-1,Extracted,"A 43-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of lower extremity edema for 2 weeks. The patient denied any pertinent past medical or family medical history; though he took metoprolol and hydrochlorthiazide for about 1 month a year earlier, he was not taking either of these agents at the time of presentation. He denied use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and recreational drugs (including cocaine, heroin and phencyclidine). Initial physical examination was significant for elevated blood pressure (151/94 mm Hg) and pitting edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory analysis at presentation (table ) revealed renal failure (serum creatinine 2.6 mg/dl) and anemia (hemoglobin 10.8 g/dl, hematocrit 33.4% and mean corpuscular volume 85.4 fl). Urinalysis (random urine; table ) showed proteinuria, small blood and pyuria without bacteria. Proteinuria was confirmed on 24-hour urine collection that demonstrated nephrotic-range protein (25 g/24 h). Kidney ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys bilaterally with multiple cysts and this was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scanning (fig. ). A complete serologic evaluation, including hepatitis screen, was performed and was unrevealing (table ).
Initially, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous steroid pulse (methylprednisolone, 1 g daily for 3 days) and then switched to prednisone orally (1 mg per kilogram daily). A CT-guided kidney biopsy was performed and revealed immune complex glomerulonephritis with features of membranous nephropathy with crescent formation (fig. ). Despite treatment with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg), the patient's renal function declined and he became oliguric. Intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. In addition to oral steroid, treatment with mycophenolate (500 mg twice daily; escalated to 1,500 mg twice daily over 2 weeks) was started. Over a 5-month period, urine output increased in association with improvement in kidney function. Concurrently, serum albumin recovered to normal values and proteinuria decreased from 25 to 3 g daily. Because of persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria, cyclosporine 75 mg twice daily was added to his medication regimen. Over the ensuing 3 months, the patient manifested further improvement in physiologic parameters. Accordingly, prednisone dosage was reduced (10 mg orally per day) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was maintained at 1,500 mg orally twice daily and cyclosporine at 75 mg orally twice daily. Hemodialysis was subsequently discontinued and the patient has been off dialysis with stable chronic kidney disease stage 3 (creatinine clearance 45 ml/min by 24-hour urine studies). He continues to be monitored closely in an outpatient setting for any changes in renal function. Immunosuppressive agents are being tapered.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [43, 'years'], 'creatinine': [2.6, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",27.075,25.721,28.429,"The patient is 43 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 2.6 mg/dL. 
The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0.
The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 2.6^(-1.154) * 43^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=27.075.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 27.075 mL/min/1.73m²."

Ten days prior to her visit, she had a low grade fever () when her 9-year-old son was diagnosed as having erythema infectiosum because of his slapped cheek rash. Seven days later, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema transiently on her face that disappeared the next day. Then, she developed swelling of her fingers and joint pain in her shoulders, ankles, and knees. Since oral administration of acetaminophen did not relieve her symptoms, she came to our clinic. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 37.0°C, blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and pulse rate was 66 beats/min. She weighed 52 kg and was 160 cm tall. At that time, she presented no malar erythema and no rash in her body. Although all her fingers were swollen, the swelling of her shoulder, ankle, and knee joints was not obvious. Laboratory data showed normal hematologic parameters (white blood cell count 6,300/μL, hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit 37.6%, and platelet count 264,000/μL). Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Due to a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody in the serum (index 8.20) and the preceding infection of her son, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was made. Oral administration of loxoprofen (180 mg/day) was immediately started after the diagnosis ().

851,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-5023919-1,Extracted,"A 59-year-old woman was admitted to the department of Neurology for a sudden confusion with loss of vision. Her past medical history comprised of a total hysterectomy twenty-five years earlier (fibroma). She also complained of headaches and chronic asthenia for 5 years: at that time, medical investigations only found a chronic seromucous maxillary sinusitis treated by antibiotherapy, then endoscopic sinus surgery (the pathological study objective a nonspecific inflammation); however, she still complained of chronic headaches despite this treatment. At the age of 55, she had also developed refractory arterial hypertension and renal failure leading to the diagnosis of right renal artery stenosis and left renal artery occlusion: she was treated by surgery (stenting of the left renal artery, then right aortorenal bypass).
On clinical examination, there was cortical blindness, anosognosia for blindness, amnesia, and topographical disorientation suggestive of a Dide-Botcazo syndrome. There was no pyramidal sign nor cerebellar ataxia or cranial nerves involvement. No other clinical abnormality was reported. She still complained of chronic headaches.
Bilateral cerebral posterior infarction and hypodensity in the territory of the right postero-inferior cerebellar artery have been observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (and magnetic resonance angiography), with a severe narrowing of the basilar artery (closed to 90%) and a mild stenosis of the M1 and M2 segments of the left middle cerebral artery (Fig. A and 1B). Transcranial Doppler confirmed a severe stenosis of the basilar artery. Electrocardiogram and 24 hours electrocardiography were normal. Echocardiography (transthoracic and transesophageal) demonstrated a hypertrophic cardiopathy (with severe left ventricular hypertrophy and circumferential dilatation of the left atrium). No valvulopathy was observed, but there was a heterogeneous thickening of the interatrial septum (1.5 cm) and a hyperechogeneous thickening next to the right atrium (1.9 × 1.3 cm). Cardiac computed tomography angiography (and cardiac MRI) confirmed a right periatrial infiltration, and also found thickening of the wall of the whole aortic arch (with tardive enhancement of media) and pericardial effusion (Fig. ). Whole-body 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET) found contrast-enhancement on the right and left atria, whole aorta, iliac arteries, and femoral arteries (Fig. E). Ophthalmological examination was normal, except a grade I hypertensive retinopathy.
Ancillary tests found hyperleukocytosis (13,000/mm3, with 8890 neutrophils/mm3), biological inflammation (C-reactive protein was 24 mg/L), with no monoclonal gammopathy. Viral and bacterial serologies, immunological (antinuclear, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) and metabolic (cholesterol, triglyceride, glycosylated hemoglobin, homocysteine, thyroid stimulating hormone, and transaminases) tests were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal (1 white cells/mm3; protein level at 46 mg/dL, for a normal value <45 mg/dL; normal glucose level). A bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormality.
Plain radiographs showed bilateral and symmetric cortical osteosclerosis of the diaphyseal and metaphyseal regions of the lower limbs; 99Technetium bone scintigraphy revealed a symmetric tracer uptake by the long bone of lower extremities (and also in maxillary and frontal bones) suggestive of the diagnosis of ECD (Fig. ). After a second biopsy of the maxillary sinus, pathological study finally demonstrated a xanthogranulomatous infiltrate mainly composed by foamy histiocytes accompanied by fibrosis (stains for CD1a and S-100 were negative), confirming the diagnosis of ECD.
She was treated with interferon-α (3 million IU 3 times weekly, then a gradual increase of the dose up to 9 million IU 3 times weekly over the following months), with not only an improvement of the cognitive function (particularly visual function and memory) but also of headaches. A treatment by clopidogrel (75 mg/d) was proposed for stroke. After 3 months of treatment with interferon-α, we observed reduction of the stenosis of the basilar artery (50%) on MR-angiography (with a quite total recanalization 2 years after the onset of the treatment; Fig. ). After 4 years, the neurological examination was still stable, but she developed insipidus diabetes (successfully treated with desmopressin).",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Female', 'age': [59, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': True, 'Hypertension history': True, 'Stroke': True, 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': False, 'Vascular disease history': True, 'Diabetes history': True}",7,7,7,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.

The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient’s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.
Though initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.
In the ED, the patient’s temperature was 103.9°F (39.9°C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.
Initial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 × 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0–10.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0–18.0], platelet count of 135 × 103/mm3 [lab range 150–350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137–145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98–107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0–30.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9–20], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7–1.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70–99], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0–10]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0–0.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38–126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13–69), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15–46). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5–10 WBC, 0–5 red blood cells (RBC), 5–10 epithelial cells, 5–10 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.
Due to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40–70], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12–60], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.
A chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure 
). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure 
). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.
Given the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure 
, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure 
. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient’s mental status.
Over the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient’s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient’s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.
On hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative.

The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 19.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 19.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 19.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 19.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 19.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 19.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 19.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L."
7416,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-3849883-1,Extracted,"This 12-year-old girl of Slavic origin is the first child of healthy, unrelated parents. During neonatal period intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight, 2700 grams) and microcephaly (head circumference, HC = 31 cm; < p3) were observed. Her past medical history revealed that she suffered from recurrent lung infections (otitis media, pneumonia) since infancy. At 18 months of age she was treated for bacterial meningitis. At 8 years of age she was hospitalized because of severe varicella complicated with pneumonia. At the same age she had an episode of hip pain diagnosed as transitory synovitis.
At 9 years of age she was referred to our Institute for investigation of repeated lung infections. Physical examination on admission included: height, 129 cm (p50) and the body weight, 29 kg (p50); microcephaly (head circumference = 46 cm, < p3); typical facial features with prominent midface, large ears and hyperthelorism with upward slant of the palpebral fissures (Figure ); hypopigmented spots on trunk and extremities; bilateral clinodactyly and syndactyly of the second and third toe were observed. Chest examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles due to bronchiectasis. Neurological examination and ophtalmologic slit-lamp examination were normal.
Immunologic investigations are presented in Table . Karyotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed typical chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and 14. Final diagnosis of NBS was established by mutation analysis of the NBS1 gene that revealed homozygousity for typical 5 base-pair deletion (657del5). She was placed on regular substitution with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in a dose of 400 milligrams/kg/body weight every 4 weeks. With this treatment acute exacerbations of her chronic lung disease decreased in frequency.
At 10 years of age she was admitted because of pain, morning stiffness and bilateral swelling of her proxymal interphalangeal (PIP), wrist and knee joints (Figure ). Affected joints were hot, swollen and tender on passive or active motion. L Laboratory investigations at that time included: erythrocyte sedimentation rate 42 mm/hr, C-reactive protein 92 mg/l (normal < 5 mg/l), hemoglobin 121 g/l, WBC count 6.2 × 109/l with 58% of neutrophils, 30% of lymphocytes and 6% of monocytes, platelets were 346 × 109/l; urinalysis was normal; liver function tests was normal; serum lactate-dehydrogenase was not increased; serum concentrations of complement components C3, 1.99 g/l and C4, 0.46 g/l both were increased. Immunologic investigations including serum immunoglobulin concentrations, peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype and proliferative response of lymphocytes to mitogen are presented in Table . Antinuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA, anti-cyclic citrullinated protein antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF) were all negative.
Diagnostic puncture of knee joint was done and 4 milliliters of cloudy, yellow sinovial exudate was obtained. Microscopic examination and bacterial culture of joint fluid specimen yielded no microogranism. Also, special cultures for Mycoplasma spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum and mycobacteria were negative.
An initial treatment included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) meloxicam together with azithromycin because of suspected mycoplasmal infection. After two months of treatment, no improvement was seen so that azithromycin was replaced for doxycycline in a daily dose of 4 mg/kg/body weight and with this treatment her joint symptoms transiently improved. However, over the next 6 months several relapses of arthritis were observed so hydroxychloroquine as disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) was given.
After one year of treatment no objective improvement of polyarthritis using defined core set of six variables for JIA (physician global assessment of disease activity; parent global assessment of disease activity; number of joints with active arthritis; number of joints with limited range of motion; child health assessment questionaiire, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was observed [,].
We decided to introduce rituximab in a standard dose regimen (375 mg/m2/month) used in children and adults affected with PID who developed autoimmune diseases []. She received six infusions of rituximab without major side-effects and continued to receive regular IVIG therapy. Treatment with rituximab led to complete clinical and laboratory remission of her polyarthritis lasting for 9 months (Table ).",What is the patient's body surface area?

Emergency medical technicians reported that the patient was discovered in the middle of the street, agitated and confused with an empty box of baking soda in his pants pocket.
On initial evaluation, the patient appeared alert, tremulous and distressed. His vitals were temperature 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate 124 beats/min, respirations 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 126/93, oxygen saturation 94% on room air. The physical examination was significant for a thin male, rocking back and forth, mumbling incoherently and forcefully blinking his eyes. The head and neck examination was notable for horizontal nystagmus, intermittent involuntary facial twitching, moist mucus membranes and no facial droop. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally. The cardiac examination revealed regular tachycardia. Neurologic examination was significant for a coarse tremor to his arms and upper torso. He would intermittently lift his legs and arms off the bed then slam them down on the stretcher. He was stuttering, disoriented, and unable to answer questions. Cerebellar function could not be tested due to the patient’s mental status. The rest of his exam was normal.
Initial laboratory values were Na 172mEq/L, K 2.5mEq/L, chloride 98mEq/L, CO2>45mEq/L, glucose 433mg/dL, BUN 16mg/dL, creatinine 1.85mg/dL, magnesium 3.2mg/dL, phosphate<1mg/dL, and calcium of 11mg/dL. Liver function tests were remarkable for a bilirubin of 1.4mg/dL, total protein of 8.5g/dL, albumin of 5.6g/dL. White blood cell count was 11.6 cells/microL and his hemoglobin was 17g/dL. A room air venous blood gas measurement 7.53, pCO2 60mmHg, pO2 39mmHg, HCO3 50mEq/L, with a base excess of 21.6mEq/L. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc of 528msec. Urinalysis: pH of 8.52 and granular casts. Serum osmolality was 364 mOsm/kg and venous lactate 12.3 mmol/L. A urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine, cannabionoids, and tricyclic antidepressants. Blood alcohol, acetaminophen, and salicylate levels were negative. A head computed tomography (CT) was obtained and revealed multiple areas of intracranial hemorrhage in the left temporal and bilateral cerebellar regions. Additionally there was subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe and right posterior frontal lobe (). CT angiography was normal without aneurysm. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was significant only for diffuse mild dilation of the small bowel and marked fluid content of the entire GI tract.
While in the ED, the patient received 2L normal saline and intravenous potassium replacement. Neurosurgery was consulted but did not recommend any surgical intervention. He was admitted to the intensive care unit where he continued to receive IV normal saline and electrolyte repletion. The patient’s mental status improved to his baseline over the next 24 hours and he was able to endorse that he had consumed an entire box of baking soda (net wt 16oz/454g). His estimated sodium burden was 5,403mEq. A repeat head CT showed stable intracranial hemorrhages. He denied suicidal ideation and after evaluation, psychiatry deemed the patient safe for discharge. He was discharged on hospital day 4 at which time he had a non-focal neurologic exam.",What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?,"{'Temperature': [35.7, 'degrees celsius'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [124.0, 'beats per minute'], 'PaCO₂': [60.0, 'mm hg'], 'respiratory rate': [18.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [11.6, 'µL']}",3,3,3,"The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 35.7 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is less than 36 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 124.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 11.6 count/µL. To convert 11.6 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 11.6 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 11600000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 60.0 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3."
5004,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-2800015-1,Extracted,"A 9-month-old female infant was admitted to our hospital because of greasy stools and failure to thrive. She had been well until two months of age, when a productive cough and fever developed. She was hospitalized twice with recurrent pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics. At three months of age, failure to thrive was noted and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from sputum cultures obtained by ventilating bronchoscopy. At seven months of age, her parents were aware of her greasy and foul-smelling loose stools that were often pale; the infant also showed poor appetite. The patient had been born to a nonconsanguineous healthy couple by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks of gestation. The patient's birth weight was 2.60 kg and there was no history of delayed passage of meconium. She had a 6-yr-old brother and the family history was unremarkable.
On admission, the infant appeared to be malnourished but was not in acute distress. The body weight was 4.5 kg (<3rd percentile for age), height 54.7 cm (<3rd percentile), and head circumference 33 cm (<3 percentile). The patient's vital signs included a temperature of 36.9℃, heart rate of 130 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 40 per minute. Her chest was not retracted and her breathing sounds were clear. The abdomen was not distended and the bowel sounds were normal. There was no organomegaly. No digital clubbing was found and a neurologic examination was negative.
A complete blood count and serum electrolytes were all within the normal limits. The serum albumin level was 2.6 g/dL and cholesterol was 100 mg/dL. AST and ALT levels were 36 U/L and 14 U/L, respectively. Plasma carotene level was 22.5 µg/dL (reference range 50-250 µg/dL). Immunologic studies of the patient were unremarkable, including normal proportions of polymorphonuclear cells, B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, and normal immunoglobulin levels. Stool fat was demonstrated microscopically. To confirm the presence of steatorrhea and estimate the quantity of stool fat, an acidified steatocrit test was performed: this gave a value of 33.3% (reference range; 0-6.5%). Stool alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance was 0.49 mL over 24 hr, which was within the normal limits. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed segmental atelectasis and patchy infiltration. An abdomen CT scan showed normal pancreas and hepatobiliary systems.
CF was suspected on the basis of isolation of MRSA in the respiratory tract, recurrent respiratory infection, and fat malabsorption. A quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test was performed, showing the average sweat chloride concentration on both thighs to be 102.0 mM/L (reference limit <40 mM/L). After obtaining informed consent from the parents, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Direct sequence analysis of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene was performed as described (). This identified compound heterozygous mutations composed of a novel splicing mutation in intron 12 (c.1766+2T>C) and a 1-bp duplication in exon 21 resulting in a frameshift mutation (c.3908dupA; Asn1303LysfsX6) (). The parents declined further genetic analysis and sweat testing of the family.
Pancreatic enzymes (lipase 25,000 IU), fat-soluble vitamins, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids were given to treat the infant's pancreatic insufficiency. She was fed with breast milk and standard infant formula. With pancreatic enzyme replacement, the steatorrhea improved and the infant gained weight slowly. She was thriving and passing formed stools by one year after hospital discharge. Her weight was at the 3rd percentile for age and her height was at the 10th percentile.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [4.5, 'kg']}",18.0,17.1,18.9,"The patient's weight is 4.5 kg.

The patient denied other constitutional symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. Vitals were as follows: afebrile, blood pressure 116/80, pulse 72, respiratory rate 21, and saturating well on 3 litres/minute nasal cannula. Physical examination showed pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities till knees, decreased bibasilar breath sounds, and jugular venous distension. There was no rash, painful nodes or splinter hemorrhages. Holosystolic murmur was heard at the apex, JVD ∼18 cm H2O. Laboratory investigations showed normal WBC count, neutrophilia with 17 bands, 26 lymphocytes, and 8 monocytes. CRP was elevated at 4.3. The patient also had a troponin level of 0.22; however, this was found to be chronically elevated. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, but no pulmonary vascular congestion, consolidation, nor effusions. Urinalysis did not show any evidence of infection. Overnight, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39.2°C.
Blood cultures turned positive for Gram-positive rods at which time the patient was started on vancomycin. Echocardiogram was performed due to concerns of endocarditis and showed left ventricular ejection fraction 20–25%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a 1 mm mobile strand in the left atrium attached to pacer lead concerning vegetation. Final blood cultures revealed Listeria monocytogenes, and two sets of subsequent cultures grew listeria. TEE was not performed as it would not have changed management. The patient was not a surgical candidate for pacemaker removal due to comorbidities and advanced heart failure. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was continued. Ampicillin was not used due to high sodium content in the infusion in setting of decreased systolic function.

48,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-4052557-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic because of the recent discovery of hypercalcemia in a routine oncological control. Her oncologist, assuming that the diagnosis was most likely to be tumor-induced hypercalcemia, referred her to an endocrinologist, who undertook further tests to reveal the etiology of hypercalcemia. The physical examination revealed her to be eupneic, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg with 84 beats per second. The patient had a history of left breast carcinoma. Our patient had undergone a left mastectomy one year previously (estrogen-receptor positive, progesterone-receptor positive, Her2 negative) and received letrozole without any complications until hospitalization. She remained well and achieved a complete response without an increase of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, (normal value <5 ng/mL)) or carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3, normal value: 0.5–29 IU/mL) since ten months.
Currently she is 1.62 m tall, weighting 62 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 23 kg/m2 and using letrozole only for the indication prescribed. She had started a course of letrozole ten months earlier. Her family history was unremarkable. As her hypercalcemia was mild and did not elicit any symptoms, she did not require immediate measures to correct this.
Investigations to determine the cause of the hypercalcemia were performed. Initial laboratory evaluation showed hypercalcemia at 11 mg/dL, iPTH as 15 pg/mL normal albumin 4.3 g/dL, and phosphorus level 3.5 mg/dL (Normal: 2.5–4.8) and creatinine 0.57 mg/dL. 24 h urinary calcium excretion was found to be 247 mg/day (normal: 100–300 mg/day). Further blood tests demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase level was 64 U/L (35–104) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was 22 ng/mL (normal: 20–30) within normal limits. A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed, which revealed mild osteopenia at the left femoral neck (T score: −1.6). No previous bone mineral density (BMD) measurement had been taken prior to this.
On other days, our patient's serum calcium and iPTH level returned to within normal range without any medications. When we analyzed the sequence of laboratory tests, there were episodes of calcium and iPTH levels with fluctuating on repeat analyses over a period of ten months between 9.5–11 mg/dL (, normal: 8.5–10.2 mg/dL) and 11–17 pg/mL (, normal: 12–65), respectively.
A workup investigation to exclude other causes of hypercalcemia was done. She underwent an extensive evaluation including careful history, family history, physical examination, and lab work to exclude possible other causes of hypercalcemia. Parathyroid hormone related peptide was 0.28 pmol/L (normal: 0–1.3) and bone scan was normal, thus making malignancy-related hypercalcemia unlikely. Computed tomography of thorax, neck and abdomen, and PET-BT did not reveal any malignancy.
Although serum phosphorus was normal and iPTH was not increased, in order to rule out hyperparathyroidism, evaluation of the parathyroid glands was performed using ultrasound and MIBI scan, which were normal. Clinically, patients with FHH (familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia) have relative hypocalciuria and inappropriately normal or elevated iPTH in the face of persistent mild hypercalcemia, none of which our patient had.
In addition to malignancy-related hypercalcemia, the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia includes calcium supplements hypervitaminosis D, milk-alkali syndrome, granulomatous diseases, medications, inflammatory and rheumatic diseases, and other endocrine disorders.
25-hydroxy vitamin D level was not elevated ruling out hypervitaminosis D. Tuberculin test, computed tomography of thorax, and bone survey were normal, thus ruling out a granulomatous process (tuberculosis or sarcoidosis). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ANA level were normal, ruling out inflammatory and rheumatic diseases. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroid hormones should be checked to help rule out hyperthyroidism. Free T4, Free T3, and TSH were normal, ruling out hyperthyroidism, and there were no signs or symptoms suggestive of Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency, acromegaly, or pheochromocytoma. Normal prolactin level and IGF-I in the age- and gender-matched normal range excluded the diagnosis of prolactinoma and acromegaly in our patient, respectively. Basal cortisol level was 19 μg/dL, and therefore we could rule out adrenal insufficiency. An overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was done. After a 1-mg dose DST, the plasma cortisol level was 0.8 μg/dL. Hence, we could rule out Cushing syndrome. A 24-hour total urinary metanephrines and fractionated catecholamines were within normal range. She had no evidence of leukemia and lymphoma and a normal complete blood count. Serum electrophoresis was negative for monoclonal proteins. She indicated no symptoms of peptic ulcer, and there was neither exogenous vitamin D intake nor family history of endocrinopathy. She had no history of taking vitamin A, calcium supplements, and thiazide medication and no recent history of immobilization. Assessment of bone metabolism using markers of bone turnover could yield useful information and guide management decisions in our case. Urinary hydroxyproline level was significantly increased (35 mg/24 h/m2; normal: 22–55 years—8.5–23.5 mg/24 h/m2).
Because of sufficient vitamin D level, oral bisphosphonate was administered and letrozole was restarted at one-half dose (1.25 mg). She was discharged and we closely follow up patient's serum calcium, CEA, CA 15-3, and for distant metastasis.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [62.0, 'kg'], 'height': [1.62, 'm'], 'creatinine': [0.57, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [52, 'years']}",98.775,93.836,103.714,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 52 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.57 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 1.62 m. The patient's weight is 62.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 62.0 kg / (1.62 m * 1.62 m) = 23.624 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.6, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 54.194 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 52) * 54.194 * 0.85) / (0.57 * 72) = 98.775 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 98.775 mL/min."
8870,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-2966577-1,Extracted,"A 26-year-old female with a history of anxiety and depression presented to our Emergency Department with sudden onset of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and an inability to vomit of 2 hours duration. Her pain was sharp, severe, and worst in the epigastrium. She reported drinking four beers and eating a Cobb salad several hours prior to presentation. She denied diarrhea, constipation, fever, and chills. She reported no similar episodes in the past and denied the consumption of non-food items.
Physical examination revealed a thin, uncomfortable appearing young woman. Her weight was 99 pounds and height was 61 inches. Her temperature was 98.6°F, pulse was 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg. The abdomen was distended, firm, and diffusely tender to palpation without peritonitis. All other examination findings were non-contributory.
Laboratory abnormalities included potassium 3.1 mEq/L, amylase 210 U/L, and lipase 114 U/L. Remaining chemistries and a complete blood count were normal. Abdominal plain film showed a grossly distended stomach filled with extensive food matter []. There was no abdominal free air. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enlarged stomach, measuring 32 cm × 17.9 cm, displacing the small bowel into the right lower quadrant and the transverse colon into the pelvis [].
The patient underwent a laparotomy (through a small epigastric midline incision) which revealed a massively distended stomach. Anterior gastrotomy showed that the stomach was filled with nearly 2 gallons of partially and minimally digested food including whole pasta shells and vegetable matter. Due to the large size and thick consistency of the stomach contents, they were removed via a 40-Fr. chest tube secured in the gastrotomy site, with gentle massage of stomach contents through the tube into a basin. Following adequate decompression, the tube was removed, the stomach mobilized out of the wound, the remaining contents emptied, and the gastrotomy closed. No discrete bezoar or mechanical gastric outlet obstruction was identified. Of note, the gastric wall was poorly perfused due to the massive distention, and the site of gastrotomy showed patchy necrosis even after decompression. Thus, a portion of the anterior wall was resected to viable appearing tissues to allow for safe closure of the gastrotomy. Pathology of the excised gastric wall showed gastric mucosal necrosis.
The following day, the patient admitted to a massive 1-hour binge prior to presentation, and revealed a history of anorexia nervosa and binge eating. At age 14, she had been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype. Although she had not engaged in binge eating for 4 years, she attributed this episode to alcohol intoxication and stress.
Postoperatively, a nasogastric tube was left in place for gastric decompression, and a post-pyloric feeding tube in case of gastric ileus after the extreme distension. The nasogastric tube was removed on day 3 and a clear liquid diet started. She advanced to a full liquid diet and was discharged on day 5. She has since resumed a full diet and has reported no problems.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [99.0, 'lbs'], 'height': [61.0, 'in']}",46.642,44.31,48.974,"The patient's gender is Female.

Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (61.0 (in inches) - 60) = 47.8 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 47.8 kg.The patient's weight is 99.0 lbs so this converts to 99.0 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 44.906 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 47.8 kg + 0.4 * (44.906 kg  - 47.8 kg) = 46.642 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 46.642 kg."

His medications consisted of clopidogrel, enalapril, finasteride, gabapentin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, metformin, and tamsulosin.
At presentation at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, in September 2020, the patient complained of weakness, fatigue, and frequent urinations. His body temperature was 39.0 °C, and blood pressure was 150/95 mm Hg, with a pulse rate of 98 beats/minute and oxygen saturation rate of 98%. He was alert and oriented, with unremarkable lung and cardiovascular examination. Laboratory findings showed leukocytes, 6.6 × 103/µL; hemoglobin, 12.2 g/dL; thrombocytes, 89 × 103/µL; glucose, 235 mg/dL; sodium, 134 mEq/L; potassium 4.6 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 16 mEq/L; calcium, 8.5 mEq/L; serum creatinine (Scr) 1.1 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 29 mg/dL; creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 9,128 IU/L; prothrombin time, 13.4 s; partial thromboplastin time, 25.3 s. Urinalysis and urinary microscopy demonstrated glucose, erythrocytes, and trace protein and no casts. A chest X-ray showed clear lungs. COVID-19 infection was diagnosed based on a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test that detected acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a throat swab sample. Initial treatment was supportive, with nasal cannula oxygen, doxycycline, and thrombosis prophylaxis with apixaban.
On day 5 after admission, the condition of the patient worsened. He became more tachypneic, with oxygen saturation decreased to 87% on nasal cannula. There were no episodes of hemodynamic instability. He developed non-oliguric deterioration of kidney function, with Scr and BUN increased to a maximum level of 5.8 mg/dL and 124 mg/dL, respectively. Arterial blood gas on non-rebreather mask showed pH 7.25, Pa O2 78 mmHg, Pa CO2 31 mmHg, and HCO3 13 meq/L. Chest X-ray showed diffuse patchy bilateral infiltrates. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), started BiPAP therapy, intravenous steroids, and was given convalescent plasma. Over the next 48 hours, his respiratory status started improving, with Scr decreasing to 1.2 mg/dL, and CPK to 280 IU/L (). He was changed to high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) () and given 5 days of remdesivir treatment.
In the following period, the patient showed gradual respiratory improvement and diuresis. At 20 days after admission, he was discharged from the ICU, and after 43 days, when his throat swab test for coronavirus became negative, he was discharged home. At the time of discharge, Scr level was 0.9 mg/dL.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [235.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [134.0, 'mEq/L']}",137.24,130.378,144.102,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.

She also complained of dusky red rash with swelling, itching, and photosensitivity over the face and extremities, and pain and swelling over bilateral knee joints since the past three years. She also developed multiple hard ulcerated lesions with chalky white discharge over face, chest, trunk, and extremities over the last six months. Her past medical and family history were unremarkable. On general physical examination, the child appeared to be emaciated with a weight of 18 kg (less than the fifth percentile for age), a height of 120 cm (less than the fifth percentile for age), and a body mass index (BMI) of 12.5 kg/m2. Examination of skin revealed the presence of confluent violaceous, edematous macules around eyelids, forehead, cheek, and chin (heliotrope rash), and erythematous firm papules of size 0.5 X 0.5 cm over metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints (Gottron papules;Figure ).
She also had erythematous scaly plaques over the elbow and the knee joints and hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation over the forehead, neck, and hands with a dystrophic and ragged cuticle (Samitz sign; Figure ).
Multiple tender ulcerated subcutaneous nodules measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 1 x 1 cm over bilateral elbows, knees, and trunk were also noted (calcinosis cutis; Figure ).
On nail capillaroscopy, dilated and tortuous capillaries and capillary dropouts were noted. Musculoskeletal examination revealed minimal tenderness of the proximal muscles of upper and lower limbs with positive Gower’s sign (use of hands and arms to ""walk"" up the body from squatting position due to proximal myopathy affecting lower limbs). Muscle power in proximal muscles of both upper and lower limbs was 3/5.
On evaluation, her liver function tests, renal function tests, fasting plasma glucose, and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. She was found to have microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL. Test for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was negative, while lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was elevated at 825 U/L (N: 130-240 U/L). Chest radiograph and two-dimensional echocardiogram were also normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip, shoulder, and ankle region revealed multiple areas of subcutaneous and intramuscular calcifications. Electromyography (EMG) was suggestive of a myopathic pattern. A punch biopsy from the ulcerated lesion on the forehead was performed, which on histopathology revealed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and follicular plugging in the epidermis. Mild vacuolar alteration at the dermo-epidermal junction was noted. Upper dermis showed mild edema along with moderate perivascular lymphocytic infiltration (Figure ).
Entire dermis showed a marked dense calcium deposition along with foreign body giant cell reaction (Figure ).
Taking into account the clinical, biochemical, and histopathological features, the girl was diagnosed with JDM. She was initiated on treatment with two immunomodulator drugs- prednisolone and methotrexate, along with supportive treatment for muscle weakness, rash, and calcinosis cutis.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She was last seen in her usual state of health 12 hours prior to arrival. Friends reported that she consumed an unknown amount of alcohol and ingested a quarter tablet of MDMA. The patient subsequently became paranoid, attempted to climb up walls, and drank ten bottles of water. She had a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure with frothing at the mouth and recurrent seizure en route the Emergency Department. Both seizures broke spontaneously. Her initial vital signs were notable for a temperature of 38.0 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats/minute, blood pressure of 140/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient was obtunded, and pupils were dilated, equal, and reactive to light bilaterally. Mucus membranes were moist. Neck was supple. Lung auscultation demonstrated good air entry with bilateral rhonchi. Cardiovascular examination was normal without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal exam was normal. Neurologic examination was limited but the patient had normal extremity tone, hyporeflexia was noted in biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles bilaterally, clonus was absent, and normal bilateral Babinski reflexes were noted. She received 10 mg of IV lorazepam for additional seizures and was intubated for airway protection. A summary of relevant laboratory findings is mentioned in . Her initial complete blood count had a white blood cell count of 20,600/μliter, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dl, and platelet count of 233,000/μliter. Her chemistry panel was as follows: sodium 112 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, chloride 84 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen of 7 mg/dl, serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl, and serum glucose of 117 mg/dl. A liver function panel was normal.
Serum lactic acid was 2.8 and osmolality was 239 mmol/L. Urine chemistries were significant for a urine sodium 112 mmol/L and urine osmolality of 439 mmol/L. The urine electrolytes were checked prior to administration of any hypertonic saline. These electrolyte derangements suggested a state of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). She received three doses of 3% hypertonic normal saline without a significant change in her serum sodium. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed cerebral edema.
Over the next couple of hours, she had increasing oxygen requirements on the ventilator of up to 100% FiO2 and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 mm Hg. The initial chest-radiograph was concerning for multifocal pneumonia; however a repeat chest-radiograph, twelve hours later, revealed diffuse bilateral hazy opacities concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.28 with PaO2 of 53 mm Hg and an alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient of 492 mm Hg. Her PaO2 : FiO2 ratio was 53 suggesting severe ARDS. At that time, she was paralyzed with cis-atracurium and started on inhaled nitric oxide as salvage therapy. She subsequently developed hemodynamic compromise and was started on norepinephrine, ultimately requiring addition of vasopressin and dopamine to maintain stable hemodynamics. Finally, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was started with immediate resolution of hypoxemia. Hyponatremia was corrected gradually with 3% hypertonic saline that led to resolution of altered mental status and improvement in hypoxemia. She was gradually weaned off of ECMO and extubated within three days.",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [84.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [16.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [112.0, 'mmol/L']}",0,0,0,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 112.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 112.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 112.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 84.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 84.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 84.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 84.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 84.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 84.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 112.0 mEq/L - (84.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L."

Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 2+ hematuria.
Renal biopsy was performed (Fig. ); 13 glomeruli could be evaluated, 2 of which exhibited global sclerosis. Moderate mesangial proliferation with several crescents and arteriolosclerotic changes were observed. Immunohistological staining was positive for IgG and IgA with a granular pattern and negative for IgM, C1q, C3, and fibrinogen. Electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in the mesangium. The patient was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy with an active lesion, and treatment consisting of 30 mg prednisolone, 50 mg cyclophosphamide, and 80 mg telmisartan per day was started. Although treatment improved the proteinuria and hematuria, the patient’s serum creatinine level remained unchanged.

7671,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-7239834-1,Extracted,"The patient was an 89-year-old man who had undergone curative radical resection via left nephroureterectomy for carcinoma of the left renal pelvis at 69 years of age and who was subsequently attending regular follow-up examinations. Plain and single-phase CECT scans were examined once per year. CECT, performed during a regular follow-up examination when the patient was 79 years of age, revealed a mass of 25 mm in diameter in segment 7 of the liver with uniform contrast. Ultrasound revealed a nodule with an unclear border and irregular shape and fairly hyperechoic signals. CT and ultrasound examination showed no splenomegaly. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) was performed as liver metastasis of carcinoma of the renal pelvis was suspected, but no uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was observed at the lesion site. As the EOB-MRI findings were suggestive of FNH, a conservative approach with regular follow-up examinations was taken. At 80 years of age, the patient developed acute myocardial infarction and his left ventricular ejection fraction (32%) was severely decreased. No changes were noted in the nodules until the patient was 87 years of age when EOB-MRI revealed a nodule of 12 mm in diameter exhibiting the same findings behind the existing FNH. The nodule was found to have increased to 20 mm in size on EOB-MRI performed when the patient was 88 years of age, and a nodule of 9 mm in diameter was also observed on the border of the right lobe. When the patient was 89 years of age, EOB-MRI again revealed 1 new nodule on the right lobe and 1 new nodule on the left lobe of the liver. Subsequently, a liver biopsy was performed (Fig. ). We performed liver biopsy to obtain a specimen of the nodule in segment 7.
A physical examination indicated that the patient’s height, weight and body temperature was 168 cm, 58 kg, and 36.5 °C, respectively. The liver was not palpable below the costal margin, and the spleen was not palpable below the costal margin. The patient’s tumor marker and serum Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer levels were within the normal ranges (Table ). No varices were detected at endoscopy. The patient’s history of alcohol intake indicated that he was only a social drinker.
The oldest plain CT and CECT images on record, taken when the patient was 73 years of age, indicated no nodules on the liver (Fig. a). Liver nodules were not noted on subsequent follow-up observations after left nephroureterectomy for carcinoma of the left renal pelvis, and no hepatic nodules were observed on CECT performed when the patient was 77 years of age (Fig. b). A hepatic mass was first identified by CECT when the patient was 79 years of age. No hepatic mass was observed on a plain CT scan obtained at that time (Fig. c). CECT, performed when the patient was 89 years of age, revealed substantial enhancement of each nodule in the arterial phase (Fig. d) and decreased contrast effect in the equilibrium phase (Fig. e).
We performed EOB-MRI using 1.5-T and 3.0-T imagers (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The nodule diameter on EOB-MRI, when the hepatic mass was first identified, was 25 mm. On T1-weighted images, it was hypointense, and on T2-weighted images, it had a hyperintense center. A dynamic study utilizing T1-weighted images revealed the lesion to be hypervascular (Fig. ).
In the hepatobiliary phase, the nodule center was hypointense and surrounded by hyperintense signals, indicating a central scar. The 12-mm FNH that appeared when the patient was 87 years of age had increased to 20 mm in diameter, with non-uniform hyperintense signals observed in the hepatobiliary phase when he was 88 years of age. New lesions were observed in the anterior and posterior segment borders of the right lobe. In the hepatobiliary phase, the nodule center was hypointense and surrounded by hyperintense signals. Over time, the FNHs increased in number and size (Fig. ).
An ultrasound examination (Logiq E9, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA), performed during the liver biopsy, revealed a nodule of 35 mm in diameter with unclear borders, an irregular shape, and fairly hyperechoic signals in segment 7 on B mode images. The nodule had no halo. We did not note any posterior echo enhancement or lateral shadows (Fig. a). Color Doppler and pulse wave Doppler ultrasound revealed arterial flow from the nodule center. The use of Sonazoid (Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) contrast agent revealed that the nodules were hypervascular, spreading out from the nodule center on the arterial phase (Fig. b).
Perfusion images indicated that the enhancement pattern of fast centrifugal filling of the lesion was composed of central vessels and radical vascular branches (the so-called spoke-wheel appearance) (Fig. d).
In the post-vascular phase (Kupffer phase), there was no defect in the lesion (Fig. e).
The background liver was normal (Fig. a). The histological and immunohistochemical findings were compatible with FNH. Staining for liver-fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) was positive (Fig. c). Immunolabelling for glutamine synthetase revealed map-like staining within the lesion (Fig. d, e). Staining for β-catenin (Fig. f), serum amyloid A (SAA) (Fig. g), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) (Fig. h), and Glypican3 (GPC3) (Fig. i) was negative. Staining of C-reactive protein (CRP) was not significantly positive. (Fig. j).

4732,22,Maintenance Fluids Calculations,physical,decimal,pmc-8185152-1,Extracted,"A 7-month-old girl presented to the Department of Gastroenterology because of recurrent episodes of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and failure to thrive for 4 months. The girl was born at 40 weeks with a birth weight of 3,000 g. The family history was unremarkable. At the age of 3 months, she was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to 8 days of unexplained fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, spasmodic cough, and aggravated shortness of breath for half a day. The patient was given intravenous administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics for clinical sepsis and supportive treatment for other symptoms in the PICU. After discharge from the PICU, the patient still suffered from multiple episodes of fever, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. On admission, she had a weight of 4.3 kg (<1st percentile, Z score, −5.10) and a height of 56 cm (<1st percentile, Z score, −5.20). Diffuse small miliary red papules around the skin of the mouth and a white ulcer (3*2 mm) on the right-side buccal mucosa of the mouth were observed. Furthermore, she suffered from perianal ulcers and vulvar abscesses. Laboratory tests showed low levels of total protein (44.89 g/L, reference range: 60–80 g/L) and albumin (25.13 g/L, reference range: 38–54 g/L), elevated white blood cells (WBCs, 17.89*10∧9/L, reference range: 8–12*10∧9/L), an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 120 mm/h, reference range: 0–20 mm/h), and elevated procalcitonin (PCT, 8.98 ng/ml, reference range: <0.1 ng/ml), and C-reactive protein (CRP, 89 mg/L, reference range: <5 mg/L) levels. The liver biochemical profile was normal. Lymphocyte subset analysis was normal. Slightly elevated levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, and IgE were detected. Endoscopy and colonoscopy were abandoned due to the low weight of the patient. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bowel wall thickening and pneumatosis. The patient was treated with montmorillonite powder, total parental nutrition (TPN), methylprednisolone, thalidomide, and intravenous administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was discharged with some symptomatic improvement. However, the patient still suffered from recurrent episodes of fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Therefore, she was suspected to have a primary immunodeficiency disease and was recommended for genetic testing.
To identify the genetic cause of the suspected primary immunodeficiency disease, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood of the patient and her parents. A novel compound heterozygous mutation c.395T>G (p.Leu132Arg)/ex.1del (p.?) in the IL-10RA gene of the patient was identified, which was inherited from her mother and father. The p.Leu132Arg mutation is located on the “C” beta-strand within the D2 region of the extracellular domain of IL-10RA (). In silico prediction tools predicted that the c.395T>G (p.Leu132Arg) missense variant was deleterious (SIFT score, −4.712; PolyPhen-2 score, 1.000), and it was defined as a likely pathogenic variant according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines (). The ex.1del variant leads to a deletion of exon 1 of IL-10RA and is predicted to cause a loss of function of IL-10RA (SIFT score, −22.749). The ex.1del mutation was classified as a damaging variant according to ACMG guidelines. Furthermore, two IL-10RA variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing () or quantitative PCR (). Neither variant has been reported previously.
To demonstrate a functional defect in the IL-10 signaling pathway caused by the identified novel IL-10RA mutation in the patient, PBMCs were isolated via Ficoll-Paque centrifugation and stimulated with recombinant human IL-6 (100 ng/ml) or IL-10 (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Cell lysates were collected for immunoblotting to detect STAT3 phosphorylation. As shown in , IL-10 treatment failed to activate STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas IL-6 induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 in PBMCs from the patient. Both IL-10 and IL-6 were able to induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 in PBMCs from healthy control and the patient's father and mother (). Taken together, the patient was diagnosed with VEO-IBD caused by a novel compound heterozygous IL-10RA mutation.
After a diagnosis of VEO-IBD caused by IL-10RA deficiency, the patient was recommended for HSCT. During a long period of 10 months of management before HSCT, the patient presented with persistent symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, vulvar abscesses, and oral and perianal ulcers. The patient was admitted to our department repeatedly and was managed with symptomatic treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics for bacterial infection, acyclovir for viral infection, methylprednisolone for intestinal inflammation, thalidomide for immunosuppression, montmorillonite powder for diarrhea and nutritional support with TPN. At the age of 19 months, the patient underwent matched unrelated peripheral blood HSCT using reduced-intensity conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin. The CD34 cell dose was 7.5 × 106 cells/kg, the number of mononuclear cells was 15.39 × 108 cells/kg, and the platelet count was 202 × 109/L. The patient was given methotrexate (3.5 mg/day) and cyclosporine A (40 mg/day) for 4 days to prevent graft-vs.-host disease. On day +14 post-HSCT, the short tandem repeat test of the blood showed that she engrafted with 94.6% of the donor cells. Currently, the patient's clinical manifestations are dramatically improved, including relieved abdominal pain and diarrhea (<4 times per day) and full recovery of skin papules, vulvar abscesses and perianal ulcers after 1 month of HSCT.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [4.3, 'kg']}",17.2,16.34,18.06,"The patient's weight is 4.3 kg.

She presented with myotonia, disabling distal weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, dementia, and cataract. Dominant limb weakness started about a year prior. Since then she was housebound, and experienced difficulty in sit to stand with visible gait deviation which developed for the past 6 months. Anthropometric data at initial admission revealed a height of 160 cm, and weight of 46 kg with equivalent body mass index 18 kg/m2. Initial blood test showed total cholesterol 353 mg/dL, triglyceride 418 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 147 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 39 mg/dL, blood glucose 105 mg/dL, but parameters reflecting liver and thyroid function were within normal range. Clinical signs concerned with diabetes were not detected. She had been taking oral statin for 2 years before the admission. On electromyography, denervation potentials and myotonic discharges were evident in all tested muscles. Southern blot analysis revealed about 650 trinucleotide (CTG) repeats expansion in the DMPK gene. She was diagnosed as DM1. She had a smoking history of 7 pack/year and alcohol abuse for the past 10 years.
In the course of rehabilitation, she intermittently complained of vague claudication of both lower limbs. Physical exam revealed weak pulsation of dorsalis pedis arteries with pale coloration of both ankles. Under the impression of deep vein thrombosis or PAOD, the following studies were performed. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) values were 0.09 on right side and 0.42 on left side (). Duplex ultrasonography study of lower extremity revealed a pulsus tardus parvus on femoral, popliteal, tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries (). Three-dimensional reconstructed abdomen computed tomography (CT) angiography showed concentric wall thickening and tapering occlusion in the distal abdominal aorta at 3.5 cm below the renal artery (). Under the impression of PAOD, she was advised to undergo bypass surgery from a thoracic surgery specialist. Preoperative pulmonary function test showed severe restrictive pattern (FVC, 42%; FEV1, 47%). The expected high cardiopulmonary risks of general anesthesia and surgery made us reluctant to conduct bypass surgery. However, due to diffuse extensive occlusive lesions and the patient's strong desire for the surgery, aortobifemoral artery bypass was performed. Biopsy showed fibrous wall thickening with intimal yellow patch lesion, confirmative of PAOD. Postoperative CT angiography showed patent lumen of the bypassed artery ().

The primary physician had made a diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia based on symptoms and chest radiographic findings, and the patient was placed on a 2-week course of antibiotics (amoxicillin and azithromycin). At that time, the SCr was 0.9 mg/dL. The patient returned to the emergency department 2 weeks later with worsening cough, chest pain radiating to the shoulders, reduction in urine output, worsening malaise, arthralgia, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.
Examination revealed an elderly woman, not in obvious respiratory distress, pale, not cyanosed, with no pitting pedal edema. There was no skin rash or mucosal ulceration. The sinuses were not tender. Pulse was 99 beats/min and regular, blood pressure was 114/64 mmHg. The precordium was normoactive, and the 1st and 2nd heart sounds were heard. The patient was tachypneic, with a RR 23 cycles/min. Oxygen saturation was 98% at room air and coarse breath sounds were heard in all the lung fields.
A basic metabolic panel revealed: sodium 128 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, bicarbonate 11 mmol/L (23 – 31 mmol/L), BUN 82 mg/dL (9.8 – 20 mg/dL), SCr 8.3 mg/dL (0.6 – 1.1 mg/dL), chloride 99 mmol/L, calcium 9.1 mg/dL (8.5 – 10.5 mg/dL), and anion gap 20 (5 – 15). SCr was 0.8 mg/dL and 1.2 mg/dL 2 and 1 weeks previously, respectively. During admission SCr increased to 9.4 mg/dL within 24 hours.
Urine dipstick was positive for blood and protein. Fractional excretion of sodium (FE Na) and FE urea were 7.5% and 63.6%, respectively. Urinary protein Cr ratio was 2.7.
Urine microscopy showed numerous eumorphic red blood cells (RBC), some dysmorphic RBC, a few white blood cells (WBC) and few granular casts. WBC count at admission was 10,000/cm3, and hemoglobin concentration was 7.7 g/dL.
Renal ultrasound revealed normal sized kidneys with increased echogenicity and no hydronephrosis. Chest radiograph showed persistence of a mass-like opacity in the right upper lobe similar to that seen on chest X-ray on the outpatient visit. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed multifocal spiculated nodules and masses within both lungs; the largest measuring ~ 3.3 × 4.8 cm in the right upper lobe, thought to represent an obstructing mass with resultant adjacent atelectasis. Further workup revealed normal C3 and C4 levels, negative ANA, ASO titers, and rheumatoid factor. C-ANCA was positive directed against PR3; titer > 8 Antibody Index (AI) (< 1.0 AI). P-ANCA was negative. Her anti-GBM IgG antibody was also positive > 8 AI (< 1.0AI), and C-reactive protein was elevated 24.5 mg/dL (< 0.5 mg/dL). Serology for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV were all negative. Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Renal and CT-guided lung biopsies were performed.
Light microscopy revealed 4 corticomedullary cores with 28 glomeruli, 5 of which were obsolescent. 16 glomeruli demonstrated cellular crescents with marked fibrinoid necrosis (). Obliteration of Bowman’s capsules and periglomerular giant cells were noted in a few glomeruli (). A marked acute and chronic interstitial infiltrate was present. Numerous red cell casts were noted. Mild tubular atrophy was accompanied by mild interstitial fibrosis. Arteries were sclerotic with no inflammation. A Congo red stain was negative.
Immunofluorescence was performed on 5 glomeruli, all of which had cellular crescents. Bright capillary loop staining was seen with antisera specific for IgG (2+; scale trace through 3+), C3 (1+), and κ and λ light chains (both 2+) (). Fibrinogen stained the crescents. No tubular basement membrane staining was seen.
Ultrastructural examination of single glomerulus demonstrated diffuse fibrinoid necrosis and marked endocapillary hypercellularity with numerous breaks in the capillary loop basement membrane. There were no immune complex-type electron dense deposits or tubuloreticular inclusions. Proximal convoluted tubular and peritubular capillary profiles were unremarkable. The CT-guided lung biopsy revealed multiple cores with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and focal vasculitis with associated multinucleated giant cells (, ). A single fragment showed hemorrhage with focal organization. An assessment of anti-GBM antibody nephritis with 57% active crescents and ANCA-positive vasculitis presenting predominantly with extra-renal manifestations (granulomatosis with polyangiitis) was made.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 128.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 128.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 128.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 128.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 128.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 128.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 11.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 11.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 11.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 11.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 11.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 11.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 128.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 11.0 mEq/L) = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 18.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 18.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 18.0 - 12 = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 6.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 6.0 mEq/L / 13.0 mEq/L = 0.462. The patient's delta ratio is 0.462."

According to the referral history, the patient was known to have bronchial asthma and used medication as needed and presented initially with difficulty in breathing at the age of 9 years. She apparently had no other medical history and was healthy prior to the first presentation. On endoscopy a growth had been seen in the larynx similar to polyposis of the larynx, and she was diagnosed as a case of RRP. That mass was excised. She again developed the same symptoms within 7 months and was operated on for another mass. She was referred for further management because of the recurrence of her symptoms.
At the time of presentation to our institute 2 months after the last surgery she had biphasic stridor, with minimal signs of respiratory distress and so was admitted for a work-up. A general examination showed that her weight was 23 kg and stature was 120cm, both below the fifth percentile, and systemic examination was unremarkable. A near-nose-throat examination was unremarkable except that on fiberoptic endoscopy, the larynx showed a papillomatous growth involving both the true vocal cords and interarytenoid area. She had a narrow airway. Her vocal cords were mobile. Her blood work showed WBC count of 12.9×109/L, with an eosinophil count of 60%. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 54 mm/hr. Due to her recurrent attacks of bronchial asthma associated with chest infections, poor weight gain and non-resolving chest symptoms and a possible history of exposure to tuberculosis in the family, a purified protein derivative test was done and the result was negative. Serology for human papilloma virus 6 and 11 was negative. c-ANCA tested positive with a titer of 28 c-ANCA tested positive with a titer of 32 AU (more than 15 AU is considered positive, normal up to 20 AU), levels were measured using a commercially available direct PR3-ANCA ELISA kit (Euro-diagnostica, Malmo, Sweden).
Direct laryngoscopy confirmed involvement of the glottic region with a papillomatous lesion bilaterally with extension into the subglottic region mainly on the left side (). Excision of the lesion was done using CO2 laser and the growth was sent for histopathology, which showed multiple vessels with evidence of vasculitis and fibrin deposits in the walls (). A number of eosinophils, plasma cells and macrophages were seen in the perivascular area. The diagnosis of CSS was made based on both histopathological and serological findings along with suggestive clinical presentation.
Within the next two months the patient had recurrence of symptoms and was again admitted with stridor. Along with stridor, she had developed a mass in the right vestibule of the nose. Flexible fiberoptic examination showed papillomatous growth involving the true vocal cord on the left side, the anterior commissure, the interarytenoid region, the subglottic region and the dorsum of the posterior third of tongue. Her vocal cords were mobile. Another surgical intervention was made to clear the airway. Excisional biopsies of the nasal mass and tongue base mass were done during the same intervention. A CT scan of the chest done postoperatively showed chronic inflammatory airway disease with a small rounded lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung. A repeat lung biopsy, which was a firm piece of tissue measuring 1×0.7×0.2 cm whose sections revealed lung tissue with parenchymal fibrosis, lymphocytic, plasma cells and eosinophilic infiltration along with fibrinoid thickening of medium-sized blood vessels and pulmonary tissue with multiple vessels showing evidence of vasculitis () The vessel wall showed fibrin deposits. Perivascular area showed a number of eosinophils with plasma cells and macrophages. The lung biopsy was consistent with the same pathology (CSS), as were tongue and nasal biopsies. The specimens also underwent Gomori methenamine silver and Steiner stains and was negative. Immunostains were not suggestive and culture showed no growth of micro-organisms.
At the time of the latest presentation the child was started on prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 6 months and this dose was tapered down over 4 month. The child was under regular follow up both by the pediatrician and our team with no further airway compromise. Her last follow-up visit was 4 years after the last intervention, when flexible fiberoptic examination of her larynx showed a clear airway. She had, however, before the last follow-up been to the emergency department from time to time for acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma.

The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and cerebral infarction 10 years ago, and also with a medical history of renal anemia and cholecystectomy. In 2014, the patient was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy by a renal biopsy and was treated with diet. In 2018, the patient progressed to chronic kidney disease stage 5 and underwent peritoneal dialysis for 2 years until this admission.
At the emergency department on Jan 25, 2020, his physical examination showed a body temperature of 38.6 °C, a blood pressure of 206/95 mmHg, a pulse rate of 85 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. He complained tenderness and rebound pain in his abdomen, with pitting lower extremity edema. Redness or discharge was not found near the peritoneal catheter. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.9 × 109/L with 80.7% neutrophils, a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 74 g/L, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 96.7 mg/L, a procalcitonin (PCT) level of 3 ng/ml, a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 939 pg/mL, an urea level of 25.27 mmol/L and a creatinine level of 924.2 μmol/L. Routine testing of the PD effluent revealed a yellow and muddy appearance with positive results in the Rivalta test, WBC count of 13,363 × 106/L (neutrophils: 98%). Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis was diagnosed initially. The PD effluent was collected for bacterial culture.
Being admitted to the Nephrology ward later in the same day, another PD effluent was collected for bacterial culture before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy. Then, the patient was empirically treated with ceftizoxime intravenously (2 g bid iv) and intraperitoneal injection of teicoplanin (0.2 g qd ip) for 7 days. On Feb 1, a gram-positive bacterium was found from PD effluent culture. Therefore, teicoplanin (0.2 g qd iv) and imipenem (0.5 g qd ip) were administered based on the antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the next 4 days. Due to the low blood concentration of teicoplanin and intraperitoneal catheter removed on Feb 5, the treatment was adjusted to teicoplanin (0.4 g qd iv) and imipenem (0.5 g q12h iv). With the continuous treatment with teicoplanin and imipenem for 15 days, the infection symptom was improved with a normal body temperature of 36.6 °C, a PCT level of 0.7 ng/ml and a CRP level of 76.8 mg/L. Routine testing of the peritoneal fluid were within normal ranges. Peritoneal dialysis effluent culture and intraperitoneal catheter culture also showed negative result.
Thereafter, arteriovenous fistula angioplasty was performed for hemodialysis on Feb 15 and the patient developed fever (38 °C) and disturbance of consciousness on the first day after surgery. No cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction were found by cranial Computed Tomography (CT). Considered the toxicity, imipenem was switched to biapenem. However, the patient’s symptoms and signs did not improve, and the laboratory test indicators gradually increased. On Feb 17, elevated PCT (0.801 ng/mL) and CRP (76.8 mg/L) was observed. Blood culture showed a negative result, and amikacin was given instead of biapenem for the treatment. On Feb 20, the patient still had a fever (37.8 °C) and thick sputum. Laboratory examination revealed a PCT of 1.34 ng/mL, a CRP of 58.5 mg/L, a ESR of more than 140 mm/h, a Hb of 45 g/L. The fecal occult blood test was positive and the blood culture was negative.

The concentration of Creatinine is 924.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Creatinine is 924.2 µmol. To convert 924.2 µmol of Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 924.2 µmol Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000924 mol Creatinine. To convert from mol Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000924 mol Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.105 g Creatinine. To convert 0.105 g of Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.105 g Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 105.0 mg Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 105.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 10.5 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 924.2 µmol Creatinine/L converts to 10.5 mg Creatinine/dL. 
The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0.
The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 10.5^(-1.154) * 69^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=4.912.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 4.912 mL/min/1.73m²."

However, the patient was discharged at the time of the first visit, since her family resisted getting any treatment due to old age. She did not undergo any treatment for 2 years, and she re-visited our emergency unit due to severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding and admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment after taking computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at a primary care center nearby.
Her obstetrical history was gravida 6. The menarche age was 16 and the menopause age was 41. She had no specific family history, but had a history of hypertension. On admission, she had a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 70 beats/min and a body temperature of 36.3℃. Her height was 150 cm and weight was 40 kg. She was associated with distended abdomen and pain to touch. Her pelvic exam revealed that bilateral adnexae and uterus were indistinguishable. A 15-cm firm and mobile mass was palpated above the symphysis pubis. Her laboratory findings revealed a low hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, a hematocrit of 25.3%, and a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 15,320/mm3. The results of routine chemical test, blood coagulation test and liver function evaluation were normal. Compared to test results from 2 years ago, the test for serum tumor markers revealed an elevated level of cancer antigen (CA)-125 from 27.3 U/mL to 111.6 U/mL (normal range 0-35), and an elevated level of CA 19-9 from 146.3 U/mL to 831.3 U/mL (normal range 0-27). The levels of alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin were normal. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor marker was slightly elevated at 5.24 ng/mL (normal range 0-4.7). The results of chest X-rays were normal, and the size of pelvic mass enlarged from 8 cm on the first visit 2 years ago to 15 cm on pelvic ultrasonography. Ultrasound demonstrated an inhomogeneous, hypoechoic, water-filled mucinous mass. Abdominal and pelvic CT revealed a large volume of ascites in the abdomen, and a 15-cm firm and mobile mass was palpated above the symphysis pubis. A 15-cm irregular multiloculated mass was observed in the abdominal cavity (). Like CT scans, MRI scans presented a 15-cm inhomogeneous mass with a large volume of ascites, and many septa and nodules were detected within the tumor (). Considering patient's old age, collaborative practice was carried out between cardiology and pulmonology departments before surgery. Anesthesia and operation were performed carefully to avoid extended operation time and volume overload. For open abdominal surgery, an incision was made at the center on the lower abdomen under general anesthesia. The mass originated from left ovary and its size was 16.5 × 12.0 × 9.5 cm. The mass had traces of rupture, the volume of ascites was about 2,500 cc, and hemoperitoneum was seen in the cecum. The patient had atrophic uterus and right ovary, but no specific finding of abdominal adhesion was found. There were no specific findings suspected of tumor metastasis in the peritoneum, greater omentum, intestines, mesentery and others. To minimize anesthesia and operation time considering patient's old age, frozen section biopsy was not performed with the consent of patients' family. To remove ovarian mass, only left salpingo-oophorectomy was done. After the surgery, the patient was treated in intensive care unit for 3 days (). The left ovarian mass was sized 16.5 × 12.0 × 9.5 cm and weighed 980 g. The fallopian tube was attached and the mass had the finding of rupture. The outer surface of multilocular mass was whitish gray and smooth, and the inner surface was smooth and filled with gelatinous contents. Firm portion or nodules were not identified. The wall thickness of septum was relatively thin, less than 0.1 cm, and the fallopian tube was 15.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter (). The final diagnosis was confirmed as mucinous BOT in the left ovary. For her age, there was no specific postoperative complication. She was treated with anemia because of a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL and a hematocrit of 25.8%. She was discharged on the 18th postoperative day.

It was a product of consanguineous parents with birth weight of 3300 grams. Problems started from third day of life with recurrent vomiting and poor intake which led to poor weight gain.
Intermittent clay colored stool was reported by parents, with changing to completely acholic type a few days before admission. No similar presentation or family history of other features of liver or edocrine disease was reported. On Physical examination length measured 50 cm (<5th percentile), weight 3000 g (<5th percentile), and head circumference 36.5 cm (5–10th percentile). She had a weak pulse, with a heart rate of about 130 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 50/40 mmHg at admission. She had pallor and decreased subcutaneous fat and ill appearance with severe dehydration. Patient's sclerae and skin were obviously jaundiced. External genitalia seemed normal female type. The patient was admitted to PICU and blood drawn for necessary laboratory tests. Initial resuscitation including; rehydration therapy and correction of blood glucose and electrolyte abnormalities started. Broad spectrum antibiotic also was administered due to patient's ill appearance.
Sepsis workups including blood culture and urine culture were performed, which later results showed both negative. Cosidering cholestasis presentation, other investigation including tyrosine level, laboratory assessment for metabolic disorders including serum and urine amino acid chromatography, urinary organic acid profile and NH3 and lactate levels were evaluated with all in normal range but serum alpha1 antitrypsin concentration was mildly increased. The markers for hepatitis and TORCH infections were also negative.
The laboratory tests were as follows: serum sodium 102 meq/lit and serum k+ level 9 meq/lit. Total and direct bilirubin was 13.9 mg/dl and 5.4 mg/dl retrospectively. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 7. Thyroid function test was normal and serum glucose level by either glucose oxidas or orthotoloidas method were lower than normal but with no significant difference. Other laboratory findings are shown in . Buccal smear was negative for bar body. Abdominal sonography showed both adrenals hypertrophic but otherwise normal. Pelvic sonography revealed the testicles in the inguinal canal, moreover, a uterus was not detected in pelvis. Ophthalmic fundoscopy in view of corioretinitis, cataract was not conclusive; chromosome study showed 46XY pattern.
Severe electrolytes abnormalities guided us to possible diagnosis of CAH, and further evaluation including findings in proved this diagnosis. Fludrocortisones and hydrocortisone replacement therapy was instituted and resulted in dramatic improvement. Electrolyte abnormalities and blood sugar was corrected during first week of treatment (Na=130 and K=4.5 Meq/lit). One week later, the total and direct bilirubin declined to 5 and 2.5 mg/dl respectively. After one month, bilirubin levels and all of the liver function tests returned to normal, jaundice disappeared and acholic stools changed to normal pattern. In the following 6 months no history of acholic stool or hypoglycemic attacks were noticed.

Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 102.0 mEq. To convert from 102.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 102.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 102.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 102.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 102.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 102.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 3.0 * (102.0/140 - 1) = -0.489 L.

The child was developmentally normal for age. Poor weight gain was reported by the parents, while there was no history of diarrhea, polyuria, polydipsia, pallor, dysuria, recurrent respiratory tract infections, or anorexia. He was born to third-degree consanguineous Tamil parents. At birth, he weighed 3.5 kg and his perinatal history was uneventful. He was immunized according to the age. At the age of 24 months, he weighed 9.7 kg (−1–−2 standard deviation [SD]), height 71 cm (−2–−3 SD), head circumference 46 cm, and vital signs and blood pressure (93/62 mmHg) being normal. No pallor, icterus, clubbing, edema, rickets, or lymphadenopathy was noted. Cardiovascular, abdominal, central nervous system and chest examinations were normal. No renal masses were appreciable. The abdominal X-ray showed nephrocalcinosis [].
He was fourth in birth order. His elder sister died at 9 years of age as a result of end-stage renal disease due to nephrocalcinosis. She had persistent vomiting at 3 months of age. She was admitted to another hospital where renal stones and high urinary oxalate levels (80 mg/24 h) were detected. A therapy based on potassium citrate and pyridoxine was suggested (at the age of 4 months), but was administered to the child only for 1 year, and then discontinued by the parents. At 8 years of age, she was found to have urinary tract infection and high serum creatinine levels (8.2 mg/dl). She was then kept on biweekly dialysis for 3 months and died at 9 years of age at home. No genetic testing was performed.
The two other siblings, aged 6 and 4 years, were healthy and did not have nephrocalcinosis, deranged renal function, or high urinary oxalate levels. Their parents were healthy; no further cases of nephrolithiasis were reported in the family.
In view of the family history and presence of nephrocalcinosis on abdominal X-ray, the child was investigated further: 24 h urinary oxalate level was high (75.7 mg/24 h), blood urea 32 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dl (estimated glomerular filtration rate 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), serum calcium 9.2 mg/dl, phosphate 4.0 mg/dl, sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl. The spot urine calcium: Creatinine ratio was 0.1 (normal for age). Venous blood gas analysis showed serum bicarbonate level 22 mEq/L. Renal ultrasonography showed medullary nephrocalcinosis.
The entire coding region of the AGXT gene (RefSeq NM_000030 2, Gene ID: 189) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA extracted from blood. Analysis of the AGXT gene by means of Sanger sequencing[] revealed the presence of two single nucleotide substitutions in homozygous state: a transversion from C to G (c. 32C>G) in exon 1 resulting in the missense substitution p. Pro11Arg and a transversion from T to A (c. 167T>A) in exon 2 resulting in the missense substitution p. Ile56Asn []. Both variants have previously been reported and are classified as pathogenic. The other polymorphic sites of the gene were found in homozygosis and corresponded to the major haplotype.[] Following the current nomenclature,[] the AGXT gene mutations detected in this patient are described as: c.[32C>G; 167T>A];[32C>G; 167T>A] at the DNA level and p.[Pro11Arg; Ile56Asn];[Pro11Arg; Ile56Asn] at the protein level. Thus, the diagnosis of PH Type 1 was confirmed. Genetic testing of the parents was advised but not performed since they did not agree to undergo any further analysis.
The patient was treated with potassium citrate (0.5 mEq/kg/day) along with pyridoxine (5 mg/kg/day).

This patient had gestational-related diabetes, but it was well-controlled by diet without medication. She was admitted to obstetrics ward of our institution on April 19 due to premature labor. During the 6-week admission period, she visited her mother who was hospitalized in the emergency department of the same institution on May 27 and 28, which was the same time that a known MERS-CoV super-spreader patient was treated there. Her mother developed illness with fever on day 7 after contacting the super-spreader and was confirmed positive by MERS-CoV RT-PCR.
Our case complained of severe myalgia without fever on June 8 and was admitted to the isolation ward 5 days after discharge. Her sputum sample was positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. Creactive protein (CRP) was elevated to 1.95 mg/dl and a chest X-ray revealed patchy opacity in both lower lobes, suggesting bronchopneumonia (). A chest X-ray taken 4 days later was improved and CRP had decreased to a value within the normal range (0.15 mg/dl). However, she complained persistently of episodes of dyspnea, sputum, and myalgia without fever. She was provided supportive treatment, but no antiviral agent or steroid because the disease was not progressing. Fetal growth was within normal gestational limits, and she recovered gradually from the myalgia and other symptoms. The results of RT-PCR follow-up tests performed on June 19 and 21 were all negative in sputum samples. The Division of Infectious Diseases confirmed a full recovery, and she moved to the obstetrics ward on June 22 where she was expected to have a normal delivery. However, she began sudden bleeding with abdominal pain on the day after recovery was declared. A pelvic examination with a speculum confirmed the vaginal bleeding. However, the transabdominal ultrasonography did not detect any placental problems or hidden hemorrhaging. Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) was 120–130 bpm with moderate variability. An obstetrician diagnosed placental abruption based on the symptoms and physical examinations. We considered spread of MERS-CoV because her symptom onset was very recent, and delivery would involve a large volume of contagious body fluids. An emergency C-sec under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) was scheduled with precautions. The surgery was performed in a designated negative pressure-ventilated isolation operating room. All designated specialized infection control personnel prepared for the surgery and wore enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) ().
A medical worker with PPE transferred the patient on an exclusive elevator. She was very anxious in the operating room, so we provided emotional support but no premedication. She was 167 cm tall and weighed 79 kg (body mass index, 28.33 kg/m2). Her baseline blood pressure and heart rate were 120/50 mmHg and 82 beats/min, respectively. SpO2 was 100% on room air and electrocardiograph results showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position, and epidural anesthesia was attempted with a 17-gauge Tuohy needle via the median approach at L3–4. The epidural space was detected using the loss-of-resistance technique, and a 22-gauge epidural catheter was inserted (). A lumbar puncture was performed with a 25-gauge Whitacre spinal needle at the L4–5 interspace, and 6 mg of 0.2% ropivacaine and 20 µg fentanyl were injected intrathecally. Levobupivacaine (0.25%, 10 ml) was administered through the epidural catheter. The patient was placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt to avoid aortocaval compression. Anesthesia was assessed bilaterally using cold and light touch, and the spinal injection produced a T4 block after 10 min. The C-sec was performed uneventfully without pain or discomfort. The baby was 3.14 kg, with Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min of 9 and 10. Umbilical vein pH was 7.363. A 10 × 10 cm blood clot was extracted and approximately 20% of the placenta appeared to be abrupted.
Total operation time was 150 min, with an estimated blood loss of 700 ml. A total of 2700 ml of crystalloid solution and 1000 ml of colloid were administered during the surgery. An infusion of oxytocin (10 units/1000 ml Ringer's lactate solution) and carbetocin (1000 µg/10 ml normal saline) was administered to produce uterine contractions and minimize blood loss, respectively.
She was administered in the operating room until a recovery block to T8, then the patient was transferred directly to a single room on the obstetrics ward. The baby was isolated in the intensive care unit, and a MERS-CoV test was negative. Maternal serum and the placenta were MERS-CoV negative. Breastfeeding was allowed by pumping instead of sucking.

Unfortunately, the patient left the hospital against medical advice at that time without further workup for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient presented two days after leaving the hospital. On physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The abdomen was soft with mild left upper quadrant tenderness. Lungs were clear to auscultation without any crackles or wheezing. The patient had an irregular heart rhythm, and no murmurs were appreciated. The patient's vital signs were stable, except for his heart rate of 100 bpm. The patient underwent a stat computed tomography angiography of the chest, which was negative for aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism. Other laboratory workup showed hemoglobin 9.1 gm/dl (reference range 13-17 gm/dl), hematocrit 27.5% (reference range 41-50%), and lipase 170 U/L (reference range 0-160 U/L).

Five minutes after the second dose of sugammadex, the TOF ratio recovered to 92%, and 8 min after the second dose, it recovered to 107%. The patient opened his eyes; moved his neck, arms, and limbs; and regained consciousness. The trachea was extubated and the patient was transferred to the ward.
When we interviewed the patient at a postoperative follow-up, he told us he had felt “numbness” on awakening from anesthesia after the cholecystectomy he underwent 6 years ago and that the anesthesiologists “did something” to cure it. He and his family also had no history of neuromuscular disorders. He was discharged without complications on the fifth postoperative day.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'height': [163.4, 'cm']}",59.961,56.963,62.959,"The patient's gender is Male.

The patient had history of hypertension, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. He had no family history of prostate cancer, and his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 1.6 ng/mL (normal range: 0–4 ng/mL). A physical examination revealed low-grade fever. Administration of 4 mg of alpha blocker did not relieve his symptoms.
Laboratory evaluations were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 9.6 g/mL, hematocrit (Ht), 28.9%, leukocytes, 8200 cells/mL, glucose, 175 mg/dL, creatinine, 0.65 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP), 17.96 mg/dL. Urinalysis noted 30–40 WBCs/hpf and 5–9 RBCs/hpf. Urine cytology is Class IIIa.
Abdomen and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lobular lesion with irregular edge and fluid collection in the left lobe of prostate ().
Chest CT scan in the presence of a dye showed bilateral, bizarre pulmonary nodules with cavitation and an enhancing mass of about 6.5 cm at its largest diameter ().
This patient was admitted to a hospital for intensive examination.
Thus, a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) as part of tissue sampling and a bronchoscopic examination were performed. Histologic examination of the prostate revealed accumulation and cellular infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as histiocytosis and necrotizing tissues. These findings were consistent with those of GPA (). Histologic examination of lung lesions also showed accumulation and cellular infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as histiocytosis with fibrinoid necrosis ().
Cerebral MRI showed that T2WI high-iso signal occupied the area from right lateral maxillary to ethmoid sinus involving a fluid collection.
An immunologic investigation showed positive c-ANCA with high anti-PR3 activity (296 U/mL).
We diagnosed GPA as the systemic disease considering these results, and the patient was treated in the department of respiratory medicine.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [65, 'years'], 'creatinine': [0.65, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",96.927,92.081,101.773,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 65 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 0.65 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.302.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.65/0.7)**-0.302 * 0.9938**65 * 1.0 = 96.927.

Figure shows the course of her body weight, which had been around 44 kg until disease onset. Her weight loss started when she was 16 years old. She was diagnosed with an eating disorder and also presented with SMA syndrome, which seemed to be caused by weight loss due to the eating disorder because no other organic abnormality was present. The patient received conservative nutrition therapy at a hospital located in her residential area when she was 17 years old. The treatment initially improved her weight, but she ceased treatment due to dissatisfaction with the patient–doctor relationship, and her weight loss resumed.
The patient reported that abdominal symptoms due to SMA syndrome, such as abdominal distension and vomiting, resulted in weight loss. She desired to undergo surgery for SMA syndrome, and found on the internet a distant hospital that performed surgery for SMA syndrome. However, after undergoing laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy, her body weight did not improve during the six months after the surgery. When she was 18 years old, she arrived at our center, the University of Tokyo Hospital, with a chief complaint of weight loss. She was immediately hospitalized due to severe malnutrition.
At hospitalization, her height and weight were 159.1 cm and 27.5 kg, respectively (i.e., body mass index [BMI] of 10.9). She was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa binge-eating/purging type (ANBP) according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition []. Notably, her vomiting, which had been considered a symptom of SMA syndrome before surgery, did not improve after surgery. Therefore, her vomiting could have been a symptom of ANBP, while she initially concealed her self-induced vomiting from us and only revealed it six months after the initial visit to our hospital.
After hospitalization, conservative treatment, including dietary nutrition and central venous nutrition, was performed while she was also monitored for refeeding syndrome. We further performed psychological work with the patient and her family, including psychoeducation, nutritional counseling with registered dietitians, and behavioral management based on operant conditioning [, ]. Her body weight gradually improved from 27.5 kg (BMI of 10.9) on day 0 to 34.1 kg (BMI of 13.5) on day 70.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [34.1, 'kg']}",74.1,70.395,77.805,"The patient's weight is 34.1 kg.

Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 60 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (34.1 kg - 20 kg) = 74.1 mL/hr.

The QT interval is 330 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/145 = 0.414.

On physical examination, no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was detected. A neurological examination revealed mild dysmetria in the left upper extremity. Her white cell count was 25,100 × 1012/l, with 61% lymphocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a homogeneously enhancing cerebellar mass causing mass effect on the tectum and obstruction at the level of the aqueduct associated with the hydrocephalus (Figures -).
The patient underwent a bilateral posterior fossa craniotomy and tumor resection, followed by the insertion of an external ventricular drain. Intraoperatively, the mass was thought to be intra-parenchymal. After surgery, she recovered well, with no new neurological deficits. Histopathology revealed an infiltrating and highly mitotic neoplasm composed of malignant lymphoid cells (Figures -). In situ hybridization (ISH) for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) was negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated no gene rearrangements in B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), (BCL6), and MYC. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and capillary gel electrophoresis per the BIOMED-2 protocol were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue, revealing a peak in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) consistent with a clonal process. The findings were diagnostic of an EBV negative, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
A bone marrow core biopsy was performed due to low white blood cell (WBC) count, which revealed the involvement of a low-grade lymphoid process (Figures -). Flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed a Lambda-monotypic, CD5 negative B cell population expressing CD19, CD23, CD22 (dim), and partial CD20 while lacking CD10 and FMC7. Aside from the lack of CD5 expression, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings were consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphoma. A diagnosis of small B cell lymphoma was rendered, with an offered differential diagnosis including CLL, marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma (CD5 negative), follicular lymphoma (CD10 negative), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Although the lack of CD5 expression makes mantle cell lymphoma a more reasonable differential, multiple studies have reported cases of CD5 negative CLL [-], with an incidence ranging from 7% to 20% among all CLL cases []. Hence no further investigations to rule out mantle cell lymphoma were required.
As mentioned above, molecular studies performed on the paraffin-embedded tissue from the brain biopsy revealed an immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) rearrangement consistent with a clonal process. We endeavored to perform a similar analysis on a sample from the patient's bone marrow biopsy, as the presence of an identical gene rearrangement would have provided support for a relationship between the two neoplasms. However, per standard protocols, the bone marrow core biopsy was acid decalcified for next day processing, compromising the integrity of the DNA necessary for the PCR. Therefore, performing an IGH rearrangement studies on the bone marrow biopsy was not a viable option, and a definitive genetic link between the two neoplastic processes could not be established.
The positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan showed no other areas of hypermetabolic involvement. Given her advanced age, she might not have tolerated the toxic effect of methotrexate. Therefore, she received one cycle of temozolomide and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). A follow-up CT scan at six months showed no residual tumor. Approximately 10 months following her initial diagnosis, she had a recurrence in the posterior fossa, which was confirmed by MRI.

He weighed 70 kg and was 168 cm tall. The patient was paraplegic. One of the bullets entered from the left arm pit and left the body from the right scapula. There was another bullet entrance from the right upper abdominal quadrant. His relatives did not present any history of previous medical issues or regular use of medications. Chest roentgenogram and computerized tomography scans indicated hemopneumothorax in the left hemithorax with destruction of the upper lobe of the left lung. In addition, the vertebral corpuses of T4 and T5 were severely destructed. There were liver and spleen injuries with intra-abdominal fluid accumulation.
A chest tube was inserted emergently into the left hemithorax and revealed 650 ml hemorrhagic fluid drainage and resulted in expansion of the lung. He was intubated, and vertebral stabilization surgery, as well as laparotomy to treat hepatic and splenic lacerations was performed. The patient was followed at the intensive care unit, however could not be extubated. His status deteriorated on the third day (PaO2/FiO2 became 154). Endotracheal aspiration and wound cultures resulted negative. The appearance of the lungs worsened on chest roentgenograms, and we diagnosed him as ARDS according to the ARDS Berlin Criteria. Despite various mechanical ventilation and physiotherapy attempts, the status of the lungs did not improve and PaO2/FiO2 ratio became 53 and pulmonary compliance decreased to 18 ml/cmH2O. We decided to institute V-V ECMO with echocardiography guidance [], despite the risk of bleeding due to multiple penetrating injuries and recent surgical treatment. ECMO flow was adjusted to 2 lt/min at a rate of 9,000 rpm, mechanic ventilator FiO2 of 0.6, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, tidal volume of 420 ml, peak inspirium pressure of (PIP) 24 mmH2O, and inspiration/expiration ratio of 1/1 which were adjusted according to the blood gas analysis. However, we needed to gradually increase the flow of ECMO to 6 lt/min due to worsening of oxygenation. V-V ECMO in conjunction with mechanic ventilation provided sufficient gas exchange ().
The patient developed septic cardiomyopathy which was confirmed with echocardiography indicating severely depressed myocardial functions (ejection fraction of 35%) on the postoperative 13th day, despite wide-spectrum antibiotherapy with vancomycin and meropenem. Although cultures were negative, white blood cell count increased to 19/uL, thrombocyte count decreased to 66/uL, CRP increased to 234 mg/L, procalcitonin increased to 8.5 ng/ml, and total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels increased to 18 mg/dl and 16 mg/dl, respectively. His inotropic score gradually increased to 40 and we decided veno-arterio-venous (hybrid) ECMO with addition of V-A ECMO to the femoral artery and vein. The deterioration in patient's hemodynamics, echocardiography findings, and blood gas analysis are presented in .
His status gradually improved in time and he was weaned off V-A-V ECMO with rapid consecutive conversion to V-V ECMO for a few hours and then completely disconnected on the 20th day with decreased leucocyte count (9/uL), increased thrombocyte count (163/uL), decreased CRP (63), and decreased total bilirubin (3/uL) levels. His mechanical ventilation parameters were FiO2 0.5, P/F 262, PEEP 8 cmH2O, TV 450 ml, PIP 23 cmH2O, I/E 1/2, and compliance 37 ml/cmH2O which were confirmed with chest X-ray ().

3400,9,MDRD GFR Equation,lab test,decimal,pmc-5337863-1,Extracted,"An 84-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital for a detailed examination of an indolent swelling on his right back. He had noticed the swelling on the day of admission; its onset was unknown. He had a 9-year history of treatment with candesartan (4 mg/day), furosemide (20 mg/day), and warfarin (2 mg/day) for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation, but he had no other remarkable medical history or family history. He was a nonsmoker and did not consume alcohol. Prior to admission, he had never presented with pain, fever, or night sweats.
On admission, his height was 159 cm, weight was 71 kg, body temperature was 36.8°C, and blood pressure was 132/76 mmHg. His heart rate was 66 beats/min and irregular. Physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities except for a painless elastic hard subcutaneous lump adjacent to the right side of the lumbar vertebrae. The lump was oval in shape and vertically long, measuring about 3 × 10 cm. His arterial blood oxygen saturation was normal at 98%. Both chest and abdominal radiographs showed normal findings. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation but no other abnormalities. Laboratory tests showed a low blood hemoglobin concentration of 12.7 g/dl (reference range, 13.5–18.0 g/dl), high international normalized ratio-prothrombin time of 1.73 (reference range, 0.85–1.15), high serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 270 U/L (reference range, 120–230 U/L), high C-reactive protein concentration of 0.66 mg/dl (reference range, 0.00–0.30 mg/dl), high blood urea nitrogen concentration of 34.8 mg/dl (reference range, 8.0–22.0 mg/dl), and high creatinine concentration of 2.35 mg/dl (reference range, 0.60–1.10 mg/dl). Because his renal dysfunction imposed a restriction upon the use of contrast agent, plain 3 T MRI of the abdomen, including the lumbar region, was performed. MRI of the abdomen revealed an oval-shaped lesion in the right psoas major muscle measuring 4 × 11 cm and exhibiting homogenous internal intensity (). This mass showed mildly high intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted imaging compared with the adjacent muscle, but its intensity on T2-weighted imaging was lower than that of water. The mass also showed high intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging, corresponding to the characteristics of an acute-phase hematoma, although the patient had no history of trauma that might have caused an intramuscular hematoma. Based on these findings, the oral warfarin administration was temporarily stopped on day 2 after providing the patient with information regarding the increased risk of cerebral infarction and obtaining his consent.
The patient underwent follow-up MRI on day 7 to ascertain whether this oval-shaped mass had changed with time, which is typically observed in hematomas. However, the internal intensity of the lesion was almost identical to that on admission, and the size of the lesion had slightly increased. Accordingly, a CT-guided needle biopsy was performed on day 9. Blood was not aspirated during the biopsy procedure, and a solid tissue specimen was obtained. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of large, atypical cells with irregularly shaped nuclei among the striate muscle fibers (). These atypical cells lacked abnormal lymphoid follicle formation and were predominantly CD20-positive on immunostaining. These cells were also weakly BCL-2–positive but CD3-, CD5-, and CD10-negative. The pathological diagnosis was DLBCL. Plain CT of the neck, chest, and abdomen on day 15 showed no significant lymphadenopathy. We consulted with the hematologists of our institution regarding curative treatment, but they discouraged immunochemotherapy because of the patient's renal dysfunction. We proposed additional examinations including detailed analysis of the lymphoma tissue using flow cytometry and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG-PET), but the patient refused.

2860,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-6833381-1,Extracted,"A 56-year-old man with a history of smoking was admitted to the emergency department
for treatment of a femoral fracture. Falling from a height had led to a slight
disturbance of consciousness. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a laceration
in the right temporal lobe of the brain and subarachnoid bleeding. Neurosurgical
consultation showed no abnormalities. Chest CT showed changes indicating hypostatic
pneumonia in both lungs. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, or heart disease. The results of laboratory tests were within normal
limits. The patient did not undergo routine anticoagulant therapy before surgery
because of the subarachnoid haemorrhage.
On the third day of hospitalisation, the patient was scheduled to undergo surgery for
internal fixation of the femoral fracture. In the operating room, peripheral
intravenous access was established in the right upper limb, and standard monitors
were placed. The Allen test was performed, and the left radial artery was then
cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring. The monitors showed a blood
pressure of 124/76 mmHg, heart rate of 108 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
Considering the patient’s anxiety, the anaesthesiologist administered 70 µg of
dexmedetomidine intravenously over 10 minutes. For anaesthetic induction, the
patient received midazolam (4 mg), sufentanil (50 µg), etomidate (15 mg), and
cisatracurium (12 mg). After intubation, the anaesthesiologist auscultated the chest
and confirmed good bilateral air entry. Anaesthesia was maintained with remifentanil
(0.1–0.2 µg/kg/minute), sevoflurane (2%) in an air–oxygen mixture, and
dexmedetomidine (0.4 µg/kg/h). Cisatracurium (5 mg) was administered at 1-hour
intervals to maintain muscle relaxation. Considering the intraoperative application
of vasoactive drugs, the anaesthesiologist inserted the central venous line through
the right internal jugular vein.
Approximately 1 hour after the surgery was started, the anaesthesiologist noticed
that the patient’s end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) had decreased from 35
to 15 mmHg within a few seconds. The oxygen saturation decreased to 80%, and the
blood pressure dropped to 80/50 mmHg. However, no significant change in the airway
pressure was noted. The anaesthesiologist immediately adjusted the mechanical
ventilation to manual ventilation and auscultated the bilateral breath sounds. The
heart rate gradually increased to 140 bpm, and an electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation. The central venous pressure increased to 28 cmH2O.
Intravenous administration of ephedrine (6 mg) was repeated, and 100% oxygen was
administered via the endotracheal tube; this was followed by administration of
epinephrine (10 µg). However, these protocols did not improve the patient’s
haemodynamics. Instant arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed hypercapnia (). Emergency TEE
demonstrated mobile echogenic densities in the right pulmonary artery and
enlargement of the right atrium, and these findings were suggestive of APE (see
Supplemental Video 1). Multidisciplinary consultation started immediately. The
following treatment was administered: epinephrine (0.05 µg/kg/minute) and
norepinephrine (0.03 µg/kg/minute), which were administered continuously;
methylprednisolone (200 mg); and 5% sodium bicarbonate liquid (100 mL).
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and the operation was
postponed. A follow-up lower extremity Doppler study indicated intraluminal
obstructions in the left superficial femoral vein and popliteal vein.
Echocardiography suggested slight enlargement of the right heart, a severe increase
in the pulmonary artery pressure, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The D-dimer
level was high at 36.25 µg/mL (reference range, 0.0–0.3 µg/mL). These results
further supported the diagnosis of APE noted on TEE. Considering his history of
subarachnoid haemorrhage, the patient could not undergo anticoagulation with heparin
or thrombolysis therapy for APE. We recommended placement of an inferior vena cava
(IVC) filter to prevent APE recurrence after a multidisciplinary risk–benefit
discussion when the patient’s haemodynamic parameters became temporarily stable.
Unfortunately, the patient and his family members refused the IVC implantation, and
the patient was discharged.

He was admitted to our hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and treated with empirical antibiotic therapy comprising piperacillin–tazobactam and levofloxacin (Fig. ). His systolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg, heart rate 126 beats/min, respiratory rate 36/min, and body temperature 39 °C. The initial laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 14,500/mm3, platelets 237,000/mm3, CRP 302.6 mg/L, BUN 29.8 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.18 mg/dL. Liver function tests were within normal ranges. The initial O2 saturation was 85% and he received O2 (5 L/min) via facial mask. On day 3, his chest X-ray findings were worse and his oxygen requirement was increased. The patient was transferred to the ICU and treated with a non-invasive positive pressure ventilator. However, his severe hypoxemia was not improved (SaO2 = 94% with FiO2 100% and respiratory rate = 45/min), and he was intubated. On ICU day 2, his severe hypoxemia was not improved despite mechanical ventilation (i.e., PaO2/FiO2 = 67.6 with a PEEP of 15 cm H2O), and his heart rate increased to 151 beats/min (SAPS II, 36). We decided to apply VV ECMO, and started CRRT for fluid management. The initial ECMO settings were as follows: blood flow 5.0 L/min, sweep gas flow 4.5 L/min, and FiO2 1.0. On ECMO day 4, a PCR test for HAdV in a sputum sample taken at the time of admission was positive; based on this finding, the patient was administered cidofovir 5 mL/kg/week. The cell differential in the BAL fluid was as follows: neutrophils 43%, lymphocytes 34%, macrophage 22%, and eosinophils 1%. All tests of the BAL specimen for bacteria and viruses were negative. Although his blood gas oxygenation and chest X-ray showed an initial improvement during the early period of VV ECMO support, they were again worse on ECMO day 7 (Fig. ). Therefore, we started treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg q 24 h, which was then tapered slowly. We attempted to maintain a conservative fluid strategy (Table ) and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and chest X-ray findings began to improve from ECMO day 9. On ECMO day 12, a tracheostomy was performed and ECMO and CRRT were removed on ECMO day 24. His net fluid balance was +10,219 mL (+425.8 mL/day) throughout the ECMO treatment (Fig. ).

Our patient underwent massive small bowel and ileocecal resection because of small bowel volvulus 12 years ago. An end-to-side anastomosis was performed between his proximal jejunum and his ascending colon, with only 40 cm of his small bowel remaining. Subsequent bowel rehabilitation therapy, which included enteral nutrition with dietary fiber, recombinant human growth hormone and glutamine, was instituted for four weeks []. Our patient was weaned from total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and had a normal diet up to the present.
One month ago, our patient developed diarrhea and weight loss of 7 kg with no obvious predisposing cause; he felt weak, anorexic and dizzy, and became progressively cachexic. Urinary volume was reduced, while stool volume was increased. On admission, our patient's body weight was 36 kg, body mass index (BMI) 12.2 kg/m2, heart rate 80 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 70/50 mmHg, and respiratory rate 18 bpm. He was oriented and cognitively intact. Pitting edema appeared in his lower extremities. An abdominal examination revealed previous surgery scarring, thin skin, a scaphoid abdomen, and negative shifting dullness. A chest X-ray showed a high density shadow of a nodule outside his right upper lung, considered to be rib calcification. A lower limb X-ray and ultrasound of both kidneys and ureters were normal. An ultrasound of his gallbladder showed gallbladder atrophy. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with T wave changes (II/III/avF/v4-6 flat, inversion), with incomplete right bundle branch block. All laboratory values are presented in Table .
Our patient was diagnosed with severe malnutrition and was supported by blood transfusion, parenteral nutrition (500 kcal/day), fluid, electrolyte, trace element and multi-vitamin supplementation (one ampoule each of Soluvit® and Addamel® daily), along with thiamine 100 mg intravenously prophylactically. Our patient's physical strength improved after these treatments, and pitting edema of the lower extremities decreased. Within 24 hours, our patient presented with profound fatigue and flaccid weakness of all four limbs. His heart rate was 98 bpm, respiration was normal, but biochemical investigation showed severe hypophosphatemia 0.05 mmol/L (Table ), hence a clinical diagnosis of RFS was made, and immediately the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. Parenteral and enteral nutrition were interrupted and intravenous supplementation with phosphate polyfusor (120 mmol on the first day, then 60 mmol per day intravenously or enterally for five days) was initiated, along with enteral and parenteral multi-vitamins and trace elements (two ampoules each of Soluvit®, Vitalipid® and Addamel® daily for two days, thereafter one ampoule of each daily). He also received a once daily intramuscular dose of Vitamin B12 0.1 mg and thiamine 100 mg. In addition, a hydrocortisone injection 100 mg was given to prevent adrenal insufficiency on the fifth day. A plasma transfusion was given to expand blood volume because blood pressure fell to 97/60 mmHg temporarily.
On the seventh day, our patient had numbness of his limbs, diarrhea and dyspnea. At the same time, a chest X-ray indicated right middle lobe pneumonia. Respiratory muscle weakness was considered to be the reason, and an emergency tracheotomy with mechanical ventilation was done, and sputum aspiration was regularly performed. Anti-diarrhea (diphenoxylate 1 pill three times a day by mouth), anti-infection (moxifloxacin 0.4 g/day intravenously), and antacid (omeprazole 40 mg intravenously twice daily) therapy were given immediately.
On the ninth day, when his blood chemistry became normal, enteral nutrition was resumed at 500 kcal/day and increased gradually. On the twelfth day, total enteral nutrition was well tolerated with improved pulmonary symptoms, and our patient was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilator support.

Three years previously, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes, which was controlled with insulin. Preoperative obstetric ultrasonography confirmed normal amniotic fluid amounts and transverse presentation of the fetus. Vital signs at the time of admission were as follows: blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, heart rate 92 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and body temperature 36.8°C. The chest radiograph showed no active lesion in the lung, and electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm. The results of arterial blood gas analysis, complete blood count, coagulation test, urine test, and liver function test were in the normal range. In preoperative anesthetic evaluation, spinal anesthesia was selected because of the high possibility of endotracheal intubation failure due to super morbid obesity.
The patient entered the operating room after an intramuscular injection of 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate after 8 hours of fasting. The vital signs measured before induction of anesthesia were as follows: blood pressure 155/78 mm Hg, heart rate 84 beats/min, body temperature 37.0°C, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and pulse oxygen saturation level 97%. Considering the possibility of hypotension, an arterial cannula was placed in the right radial artery for invasive arterial pressure monitoring during spinal anesthesia. The patient was placed in a sitting position for easy confirmation of landmarks, and the anesthesiologist explored the surface anatomy. The L3–4 and L4–5 interspinous spaces were palpable. After sterile preparation, the skin was locally anesthetized with 20 mg of 2% liodcaine, and spinal anesthesia was performed through the L3–4 interspinous space using a 89 mm 24-gauge spinal needle. After dura puncture, cerebrospinal fluid was confirmed, and 9 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 20 μg of fentanyl were injected into the subarachnoid space. The patient was then placed in a supine position, and the block level of spinal anesthesia was checked. A sensory block test to cold alcohol pads confirmed nerve block to the T8 dermatome level. Immediately after spinal anesthesia, invasive arterial blood pressure was measured as 156/85 mm Hg and heart rate as 99 beats/min. Seven minutes after the operation began, a boy weighing 4.170 kg was delivered; the baby had Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Invasive arterial blood pressure was maintained between 165/85 and 94/38 mm Hg and heart rate was maintained between 69 and 105 beats/min.

The total operation time was 68 minutes. The block level of spinal anesthesia was maintained at the T8 dermatome level during the operation and was also confirmed at the end of operation. The patient did not experience intraoperative pain. At the end of surgery, the blood glucose level was 95 mg/dL.

He had a past medical history of adrenal adenoma, chronic gastritis, and a vasectomy in 1993. The patient's medications prior to admission were alprazolam, esomeprazole, probiotics, and a daily multivitamin. The patient is aware of his left-sided weakness and complains of heaviness on his left side. He reports no history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. The patient's spouse reported that he had been unwell for three months with unexplained weight loss, fever, chills, and loss of appetite. At the time of presentation, various specialists including gastroenterology failed to determine an underlying cause for the patient's complaints besides “anemia of chronic disease.” Furthermore, he was scheduled for an upper and lower endoscopy the day of presentation and was in the process of preparation (cathartics) for that. He has been on a gluten-free diet for elevated tissue transglutaminase and gliadin antibody titers by his endocrinologist. Upon arrival at patient's residence, EMS reported a positive stroke screen with a Cincinnati score of 2, positive for left arm weakness, and left-sided facial droop.

His neurologic exam was positive for a left facial droop with weakness of cranial nerves 3, 5, and 7. There was no uvular deviation, and pupils were equal and reactive bilaterally with intact extraocular movements. The upper extremities had symmetric sensation to fine touch with a left pronator drift and 3/5 strength in the proximal and distal muscle groups in comparison to the right. There was no dysmetria. The lower extremities had 5/5 strength bilaterally and absent Babinski reflexes. His NIH stroke scale score was 6. The rest of his physical exam was unremarkable.
Initial labs included a metabolic panel with measured sodium of 131 mmol/L and blood glucose of 125 mg/dL but were otherwise normal. The complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.9%. The white blood cell count was 12.5 thou/cu mm with 78.8% neutrophils and no bands. Cardiac enzymes and urinalysis were both normal. The point-of-care INR was 1.5. Stroke alert protocol imaging included a CT angiogram of the head and neck with and without contrast and postprocedure multiplanar reconstructions. These revealed acute/subacute CVA in the right insula cortex and right basal ganglia () as well as significant narrowing of the proximal M1 branch of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) secondary to either embolus or atherosclerotic disease ().

An X-ray revealed an abnormal contour of the right heart border (Figure ).
In order to further investigate the abnormal contouring of the right heart border, a CAT (computed tomography) scan of the chest was performed. Upon checking CAT scan results, the patient was found to have a partially thrombosed aneurysm arising from the native right coronary artery (RCA) measuring approximately 6.9 cm that was also compressing the right atrium (Figure ).
The patient did not report any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness. He stated that he was in his usual state of health. He presented with baseline bradycardia with heart rate in the 40s, however, since he was asymptomatic, no further treatment was performed for the bradycardia. Electrocardiogram revealed a bi-fascicular block with Wenckebach. Other labs were normal except for the leucocytosis due to pneumonia (Figure ).
Upon initial evaluation and the echocardiography (Figure ), it was uncertain whether the aneurysm was from the venous graft or the native coronary artery. Thus, it was decided to proceed with the cardiac catheterization to further evaluate the nature of the aneurysm. Catheterization revealed patent LIMA (left internal mammary artery) and RCA grafts along with a native RCA aneurysm (Figure ).
The case was discussed with cardiothoracic surgeons for interdepartmental consultation and the consensus was that the patient will need a cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for the imaging of RCA anatomy prior to intervention.

Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 5.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 5."

The diagnosis was confirmed by deficiency of G6Pase-α activity in liver biopsy tissue and evidence of hyperlactacidemia. There is no information about whether genetic tests were performed.
Besides frequent epistaxis and an episode of enteritis, he had a normal childhood, without symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (median fast glucose determinations of 3,3 mmol/L) as long he maintained frequent meals with carbohydrate rich food.
When 15 years old, short stature and delayed puberty were noticed and he was started, at first, on human chorionic gonadotropin, and then testosterone supplementation. Three years later, he was admitted with hyperuricemia (over 700 mcmol/L) associated gouty arthritis and he was started on alopurinol 300 mg once daily. His blood chemistry revealed hyperlactacidemia and hyperlipidemia with total cholesterol over 7,7 mmol/L and triglyceride over 11,2 mmol/L. Apolipoprotein B100 and Apolipoprotein B100/Apolipoprotein A1 ratio were also elevated. He was started on ciprofibrate 100 mg once daily at 36 years, with poor response, replaced by fenofibrate 267 mg once daily combined with nicotinic acid 1 g twice daily, with good response (total cholesterol over 8 mmol/L and triglycerides over 4,8 mmol/L). The carotid ultrasound revealed atherosclerotic plaques, without hemodynamically significant stenosis and the electrocardiogram was suggestive of antero-lateral ischemia, not confirmed on myocardial perfusion scan. At 47 years old, omega-3-acid ethyl ester 1 g twice daily was introduced, in association with fenofibrate and nicotinic acid, with better response (total cholesterol below 5,5 mmol/L and triglycerides below 2,5 mmol/L).
Moreover, he had iron deficiency anemia known from 26 years old, refractory to iron supplementation. During follow up low bone mineral density was noticed (Tscore of – 3,3 at the lumbar spine and Tscore of −1,1 at the femur neck, Z score not available), with significant gain of bone mineral density after 3 years of therapy with biphosphonates. Important proteinuria was also noted (over 500 mg/24 hours), with slight elevation of creatinine (116 mcmol/L), which warranted a nephrologist referral. No urolithiasis was present, although he referred past history of renal colic. Gouty arthritis crisis occurred monthly and high blood pressure was diagnosed, with the need for antihypertensive therapy.
About his family history, he is the oldest of three brothers (the youngest with 47 and 41 years old, respectively) with the same diagnosis, the former with end-stage renal disease (focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis), under hemodialysis. In respect to offspring, he has a healthy daughter.
Furthermore short stature (height of 1,56 m, weight of 54 Kg and body mass index of 22 Kg/m2) and hepatomegaly, his physical exam is unremarkable. No cognitive dysfunction is noted.
After being diagnosed, he was started on UCCS, interrupted for bad compliance.
He is currently under therapy with losartan, acetylsalicylic acid, iron, folic acid, alopurinol, fenofibrate, omega-3-acid ethyl esters, nicotinic acid plus laropiprant and alendronic acid plus colecalciferol.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [54.0, 'kg'], 'height': [1.56, 'm']}",53.555,50.877,56.233,"The patient's gender is Male.

A 66-year-old woman with recurrent intermittent upper quadrant abdominal pain visited our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Physical examination and initial vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.0℃; pulse rate, 66 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 140/90 mmHg. Her height and body weight were 158 cm and 66 kg. She had a 10-year history of hypertension with good blood pressure control from oral Valsartan (40 mg/day). Her familial history was unremarkable. Laboratory examinations showed a low white blood cell count of 3,920/µL, a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/L, and a platelet count of 124,000/µL. The liver function test results were as follows: serum aspartate transaminase: 14 U/L; alanine transaminase: 19 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 88 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase: 16 U/L; total bilirubin: 4.05 µmol/L; albumin, 35.7 g/L; and international normalized ratio: 0.93. CA 19-9 and α-FP were assayed for a malignancy workup, with results of 16.35 U/mL and 2.61 ng/mL, respectively. The results for viral markers including HBV surface antigen and anti-HCV were negative. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic left lobar and dilated bile duct with the middle hepatic vein close to the cystic lesion (). Abdominal MRCP revealed irregular intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (IHBDD) of the left lobe with the left hepatic duct obstructed, while the common bile duct and right intrahepatic bile duct were normal (). However, we found that the irregular cystic dilatation of the bile duct was limited to the left liver and contained stones inside the cysts. No obvious abnormal dilated bile duct was found in the right liver. The common bile duct and the hepatic duct were normal, and no obvious dilatation was found. This patient was diagnosed with Caroli disease (type V). The surgical indication for the patient was explicit. However, the treatment prescription required consideration of the cystic wall being adjacent to the middle hepatic vein, the left hepatic atrophy and structure disorder, and the observation that the left hepatic vein was not visible. Although complete resection of the cysts may be a curative treatment for unilobar Caroli disease, this treatment was impossible for this patient due to the close adherence of the middle hepatic vein to the cystic wall. Therefore, we decided to perform laparoscopic left LR for the patient, while preserving a partial cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein.
The standard laparoscopic equipment used to perform laparoscopic hepatectomy included a 30° 5-mm laparoscope, a hook dissector, 5-mm laparoscopic forceps, a 5-mm atraumatic grasper, a 10-mm GIA (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Shanghai, China), 5-mm harmonic (Johnson & Johnson Medical) and 10-mm locking pliers.
The conventional fully laparoscopic multiport approach was adopted. The patient was placed in a supine position, and the surgeon stood on the right side. Under general anesthesia, five 5- to 10-mm incisions were made in a “U” configuration. Division of the liver parenchyma was performed with Harmonic or Endo-GIA. Large pedicles were stapled or clipped.
Upon surgical exploration, the left lobe of the liver was found to be atrophied, and the right liver had developed compensatory hyperplasia with a red-brown and smooth surface. However, the left liver lobe was severely adherent. We gradually dissected the adhesion using harmonic pliers and exposed the atrophic left lobe (5 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm). The gallbladder was approximately 7 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm in size and was filled with bile and gallstones. Through intraoperative exploration, we confirmed the diagnosis of Caroli disease, limited to the left lobe of the liver. We obtained a biopsy from the edge of the lesion and performed a rapid intraoperative pathological examination to exclude malignant tumor. We then decided to perform a laparoscopic left liver and gallbladder resection. The difficulty was that the lesion was close to the middle hepatic vein. We opened the cysts and resected most of the lesion while retaining part of cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein. After laparoscopic left half-liver and gallbladder resection, the liver lesion tissue and gallbladder were removed completely from the abdominal cavity. Histopathologic findings showed congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, confirming the preoperative diagnosis of Caroli disease (). Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed large, cystic dilations of the large intrahepatic bile ducts. This patient was seen regularly every 3 months at the outpatient department. There was no recurrence of abdominal pain, and no complications were discovered after 18 months of follow-up.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

She was a fifth-born to consanguineous parents, born full term after an unremarkable pregnancy. Her birth weight was 4kg, and meconium was passed on the first day of life. She had a 14-year-old sister diagnosed with CF at 1 year of age. The parents were concerned regarding the salty taste of their daughter’s skin and an offensive stool odor since birth. They also noticed her stools becoming oily and bulky by 3 months of age, but she was not investigated for CF.
The patient had a persistent paroxysmal cough for 3 weeks that progressed as she developed shortness of breath and tachypnea. She also had a 1 week history of vomiting, lethargy and decreased oral intake. Her parents sought medical advice at private clinics, and bronchodilators and antibiotics were prescribed, without improvement. Three days prior to admission, the patient’s sister fell on the patient’s neck and chest; the next day, swelling was noticed on the patient’s neck.
During the initial examination, the patient was found to be irritable in severe distress, tachypneic, tachycardic with normal blood pressure, and severely dehydrated. She had palpable subcutaneous crepitation over her neck, extending to the anterior chest wall. There was intercostal and subcostal retraction; on auscultation, air entry was decreased with the bilateral presence of crepitation.
A basic workup revealed metabolic alkalosis in capillary blood gas (pH 7.48; partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, PaO2, 88mmol/L; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2, 48mmol/L; bicarbonate, HCO3, 35mmol/L), hypokalemia (potassium 3mmol/L), hyponatremia (sodium 125mmol/L), hypochloremia (chloride 61mmol/L) and renal impairment with high urea (15.9mmol/L) and creatinine (155mmol/L) and low urine chloride (<20mmol/L). In addition, a normal calcium/creatinine ratio was detected in her urine (0.107mol/1mol), and a septic workup was negative. A chest X-ray (Fig. ) showed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. In addition to oxygen provided by a face mask, she was given two intravenous boluses of 0.9% saline (20ml/kg each), followed by maintenance intravenous infusion of 0.45% saline with potassium chloride supplementation. Ceftriaxone and clindamycin were started intravenously. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her neck (Fig. ) showed a tracheal tear with pneumomediastinum.
During admission, she significantly improved regarding hydration, activity, and oral intake. Electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. Her tracheal tear was managed conservatively. The neck swelling disappeared, and a subsequent X-ray and CT scan 1 week later showed complete resolution of the air leak. A sweat chloride test had high results (95mmol/L) (conductance method), and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation test was performed. She was started on pancreatic enzymes, a vitamin supplement, a salt supplement, and regular chest physiotherapy. After completing a course of antibiotics, she was discharged in stable condition. The CF gene was later reported to contain a homozygous mutation (c.2988 + 1G > A; IVS18 + 1G > A).",What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?,"{'Sodium': [125.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [35.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Chloride': [61.0, 'mmol/L']}",17.0,16.15,17.85,"To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 125.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 125.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 125.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 125.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 125.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 61.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 61.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 61.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 61.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 61.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 61.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 35.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 35.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 35.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 35.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 35.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 35.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 125.0 mEq/L - (61.0 mEq/L + 35.0 mEq/L) = 29.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 29.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 29.0 - 12 = 17.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 17.0 mEq/L."

The patient was intubated for airway protection and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). On ICU admission, his GCS score decreased to 4 with decerebrate posturing and generalized tonic-clonic seizures requiring 2 doses of intravenous diazepam. Auscultation of the lungs was normal. Blood pressure registered via a radial catheter was 60/30 mmHg with poor peripheral perfusion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed hyperkinetic ventricles with normal diastolic and valvular function. The initial 12-lead ECG demonstrated an irregular rhythm with no clearly visible P waves and coved-type rectilinear-sloping ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2 as well as an elevated J-point in leads V3 and V4 consistent with the Brugada type 1 pattern (). Laboratory results showed a severe metabolic acidosis with a HCO3- of 5.4 mmol/l and a pH of 6.60. The serum osmolality was 414 mOsm/kg, Na+ 144 mmol/l, K+ 6.7 mmol/l, urea 7.6 mmol/l, glucose 16.4 mmol/l, Cl- 103 mmol/l and lactate 12.9 mmol/l. The anion and osmolal gaps were calculated:
Anion gap: ([Na] + [K]) − ([Cl] + [HCO3]) = (144 + 6.7) − (103 + 5.4) = 42.3 mmol/l (normal value: 14±4 mmol/l)
Osmolal gap: Serum osmol − (1.86 (Na + K) + glucose + urea + 10) = 414 − 314.3 = 99.7 mOsm/kg (normal value: <10 mOsm/kg)
Due to the suspicious circumstances and severe metabolic acidosis with extremely enhanced anion and osmolal gaps, methanol (MeOH) or ethylene glycol intoxication was suspected and a serum toxicologic screen was ordered. Correction of acidosis was initiated with bicarbonate infusions and shortly after with continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVH) and therapy with intravenous thiamine, pyridoxine, folic acid and ethanol was instituted. Fluid resuscitation and a noradrenaline infusion improved haemodynamic parameters. After amelioration of metabolic acidosis (pH 6.97, HCO3- 11 mmol/l) and correction of hyperkalaemia in 6 hours, the 12-lead ECG showed resolution of the Brugada type 1 pattern ().

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 103.0 mmol.

The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.4 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.4 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.4 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.4 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 5.4 mEq/L) = 35.6 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 35.6 mEq/L.
Plugging in 35.6 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 35.6 - 12 = 23.6 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 23.6 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 23.6 mEq/L / 18.6 mEq/L = 1.269. The patient's delta ratio is 1.269."

She was the second child of unrelated parents. The mother of the neonate was healthy, and the father had a history of nephrolithiasis. The sister of the neonate was 6 years old and healthy. The patient was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and normal delivery with a birth weight of 2.95 kg. The infant was exclusively fed breast milk. A vitamin D supplement was not given to the patient or her mother.
Poor feeding, hypotonia, lethargy, and irritability were not noted. Stool frequency was one time per week. At admission, the patient's height and weight were 52.4 cm (25th percentile) and 3.7 kg (15th–25th percentile), respectively. Urine output measured 7.7 mL/kg/day. On physical examination, no dysmorphic facial features of Williams-Beuren syndrome were found. Subcutaneous necrosis was not found. A renal ultrasonogram revealed bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis (). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed 2 atrial septal defects without cardiovascular signs of Williams-Beuren syndrome.
Results of the laboratory investigations confirmed hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Serum levels of total calcium and pH-adjusted ionized calcium were 12.8 mg/dL (normal range, 8.8–10.8 mg/dL) and 3.33 mEq/L (normal range, 2.2–2.5 mEq/L), respectively. The serum level of phosphate was 4.3 mg/dL (normal range for age, 4.8–8.2 mg/dL). The albumin level, which can affect the serum level of total calcium, was within the normal range (4.1 g/dL). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were 21 mg/dL and 0.35 mg/dL, respectively. Hypercalciuria was noted. The calcium/creatinine ratio of spot urine was 2.81 (normal for age, <0.8), and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion was 20.4 mg/kg (normal range, <4 mg/kg). Results of the blood gas analysis revealed no metabolic acidosis that could be related with renal tubular acidosis. The intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was suppressed to 3.6 pg/mL (normal value, 15.0–65.0 pg/mL), and the PTH-related protein level was <1.1 pmol/L. The 25-OH-D level was 13.01 ng/mL (normal range, >20 ng/mL), and the 1,25-OH-D level was 71.27 pg/mL (normal range, 19.6-54.3 pg/mL). Serum levels of sodium, potassium, glucose, and magnesium and the complete blood cell count were within normal range.
Under the suspicion of infantile hypercalcemia, we conducted targeted exome sequencing. The process of targeted exome sequencing consisted of genomic DNA extraction, exome sequencing, filtering, analysis, and Sanger sequencing validation in the patient and her parents. Library preparation and massively parallel sequencing were conducted with the TruSight One sequencing panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and NextSeq (Illumina), respectively. Generated reads were aligned to the hg19 human reference sequence. No mutation of CYP24A1 was identified. However, SLC34A1 missense mutations were identified in the compound heterozygous state in the patient (c.1337G>A, c.1483C>T) and were validated by Sanger sequencing (). Sanger sequencing of the parents revealed that c.1337G>A was inherited from the heterozygotic father, resulting in substitution of glycine with aspartic acid. Allele frequency of p.Gly446Asp was 0.01% in the Genome Aggregation Database and 0.05% in the Korean Reference Genome. The c.1483C>T was inherited from the heterozygotic mother, resulting in substitution of arginine with cysteine. Allele frequency of p.Arg495Cys was 0.02% in the Genome Aggregation Database and 0.05% in the Korean Reference Genome. These 2 variants had been interpreted as variants of unknown significance, and they have not been previously reported in IIH.
Although we did not perform an in vitro functional test, in silico analysis using the SIFT tool (; PMID: 19561590) and PolyPhen-2 tool (; PMID: 20354512) suggested that the amino acid change was deleterious. Considering that IIH is an inherited autosomal recessive trait and the patient's elevated level of 1,25-OH-D, the compound heterozygous mutations inherited from each parent could be regarded as the patient’s cause of infantile hypercalcemia.
Clinical course of the patients is demonstrated in (. To treat the patient's hypercalcemia, intravenous hydration with normal saline was started on the second day of hospitalization. Intravenous furosemide was also administered to the patient (1 mg/kg/day) at that time. After 7 days of hospitalization, the patient's serum calcium level decreased to 11 mg/dL, but ionized calcium was still elevated (3.26 mEq/L). For this reason, a corticosteroid (hydrocortisone, 3 mg/kg/day) was administered for 1 week. All medications were stopped at the age of 45 days. Thereafter, the patient was fed low-calcium, vitamin D-free formula (Calcilo XD, Abbott Nutrition, Columbus, OH, USA) for 3 months.
Currently, at the age of 7 months, the patient's calcium and phosphate levels are within normal range, and hypercalciuria waxes and wanes. The previously noted renal echogenicity improved on the follow-up ultrasonogram, and developmental delay was not noted.
Limited data on natural history and long-term prognosis of IIH are available. Two siblings (1 boy and 1 girl) with mutations in SLC34A1 resulting in the substitution of histidine for arginine at position 495 were reported recently. The boy presented with hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis at 18 months [].",What is the patient's body surface area?

During the hospital stay, he developed jaundice and was diagnosed with an aneurysm of the distal descending thoracic aorta. He was then transferred to Yonsei Medical Center, where he received further treatment.
The physical examination upon admission revealed the following vital signs: blood pressure 160/110 mmHg, pulse rate 85 beats/minute, respiration rate 18 breaths/minute, and body temperature 36.7℃. There was a slight hepatosplenomegaly without evidence of other abdominal masses.

On the first day of hospitalization, a computerized tomography (CT) of the aorta and a dynamic CT of the liver were taken. The CT of the aorta showed a fusiform shaped aneurysm at the distal descending thoracic aorta measuring 4 cm at the maximal diameter, with circumferential calcification of the aneurysm wall. The CT also revealed surface nodularity of the liver, suggesting liver cirrhosis, and numerous small nodules throughout the entire liver. The dynamic liver CT showed multiple nodular lesions with arterial enhancement and delayed washout in both lobes of the liver (). On the fifth day, a US-guided liver gun biopsy was performed on a 2.5 cm-sized hyperechoic nodule with a peripheral halo in the right lobe of the liver (). The liver biopsy showed a hepatocellular nodule with slightly increased cellularity, fatty change, and Mallory bodies (). It also showed unpaired arteries and focal sinusoidal expression of CD34, indicating increased angiogenesis in the nodule; however, both the structural and cytological atypia were unremarkable and there was focal iron deposition. The background revealed alcoholic micronodular cirrhosis. From these observations, the lesion was tentatively diagnosed as a hypervascular hyperplastic nodule in alcoholic cirrhosis. On the twelfth day, a percutaneous transarterial angiography with stent insertion at the aortic aneurysm was performed. Two days later, an aortic CT demonstrated the complete exclusion of the aneurysm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was performed on the fifteenth day revealed underlying liver cirrhosis and numerous nodules that showed high signals on T1 weighted images, but there were some with a central low signal portion (). Among those, arterial phase enhancing nodules were present, suggesting overt HCCs. Other nodules also showed central enhancement patterns, suggesting dysplastic nodules with subfocus HCCs (). On the nineteenth day, a second liver gun biopsy was performed on the same lesion as the first biopsy and demonstrated the same pathological features. From these findings, the possibility of mistargeting the biopsy was ruled out and the diagnosis of hypervascular hyperplastic nodules in alcoholic cirrhosis was confirmed. Hepatic angiography performed on the twenty-fourth day showed faint multiple nodular staining of both liver lobes in the early arterial phase ().

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 136.5 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 96.7 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 23.9 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.5 mEq/L - (96.7 mEq/L + 23.9 mEq/L) = 15.9 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.9 mEq/L.

Plugging in 16.65 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 16.65 - 12 = 4.65 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 4.65 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 4.65 mEq/L / 0.10000000000000142 mEq/L = 46.5. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 46.5."

The history of presenting complaints revealed that for last 7-8 months she had experienced occasional brief episodes of limb weakness, which tends to occur at rest following exertion. For the last 3 days, the patient experienced increasing episodes of weakness and along with her meals she had also consumed approximately 200 ml coconut water per day. There was no history of recent animal bite, illicit drug or alcohol abuse. She had no past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and chronic kidney disease. Her current medications included tablet thyroxine 100 mcg before breakfast.
On presentation, she was afebrile. Her heart rate was 80/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, systolic blood pressure was 86 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Physical examination revealed hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases and the knuckles and patchy hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa [Figures and ]. Neurological examination revealed fully intact mental status, 1/5 power in both upper and lower extremities on the medical Research Council scale and diminished deep tendon reflexes in all extremities. Superficial, deep, and cortical sensations were intact and cranial nerves; fundoscopy was normal. Examination of abdomen, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems were unremarkable.
The initial laboratory tests showed serum sodium of 123 mmol/L, serum potassium 10.4 mmol/L, serum chloride 103 mmol/L, serum creatinine 0.89 mg/dL, and random blood sugar 99 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with high anion gap: pH 7.29, PCO224, PO282, HCO312, anion gap 20. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tall and peaked T-waves. Transtubular potassium gradient value was 5.1.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 126.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 126.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 126.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 126.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 126.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 126.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 103.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 103.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 103.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 103.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 103.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 17.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 17.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 17.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 17.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 17.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 126.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 6.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 6.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 6.0 - 12 = -6.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -6.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -6.0 mEq/L / 7.0 mEq/L = -0.857. The patient's delta ratio is -0.857."

The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.
Primary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient’s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient’s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient’s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.
Labs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).
The patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).
Along with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.
The findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.
On EGD, the patient’s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient’s lab derangements (Fig. ).
The decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.
The patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.
The patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient’s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning). He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management.",What is the patient's body surface area?

A quantitative test for urine glucose was 7.56 g/24 h. Her medical history and clinical examination revealed no significant findings. Fasting plasma glucose (4.92 mmol/l), albumin (42.8 g/l), creatinine (97 μmol/l), sodium (139.80 mmol/l), chloride (138.5 mmol/l), potassium (3.92 mmol/l), calcium (2.10 mmol/l), phosphate (1.04 mmol/l), magnesium (1.08 mmol/l), bicarbonate (19.4 mmol/l), uric acid (79 μmol/l), and hemoglobin A1C (5.3 %) were all within normal ranges. One hundred healthy Chinese volunteers (200 chromosomes) were included as controls. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation in the study.
Genomic DNA was extracted by salting out from peripheral white blood cells. The entire coding region and adjacent intronic segments of SLC5A2 were screened for mutations by the direct sequencing of PCR products. The genomic DNA reference sequences of SLC5A2 (NG_012892.1, Gene ID: 6524, MIM: 182381, GEO Profiles ID: 62739973 and 65974292) and protein reference sequences of SGLT2 (NP_003032, UniProtKB - P31639) were acquired from the Entrez gene and protein database, respectively. To exclude the possibility that the identified mutations represented common polymorphisms, control chromosomes were tested by PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism. A novel missense SLC5A2 mutation was found in the patient (c.1891G > A/p.E631K, Fig. ). The amino acid residue (631E) was found to be highly conserved among human SGLT subtypes and across SGLT2 homologs in multiple species. The mutation was not detected in any of the control 200 chromosomes, indicating that it does not represent a common polymorphism.
Human SGLT2 cDNA from normal kidney, generated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Wild-type and c.1891A mutagenized SLC5A2 generated by site-directed mutagenesis were subcloned into the PEXL-GFP vector [], and verified by sequencing. Human HEK293 cells (obtained from central laboratories of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and originally from the American Type Culture Collection) were seeded into 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. Plasmid constructs (0.5 μg) were transfected into cultured cells at 70–80 % confluency using X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). After 24 h of incubation, expression of SGLT2 wild type–GFP and mutant–GFP fusion proteins was detected by western blotting, confocal laser microscopy, and transport assays as we have done in previous studies [, ].
Western blotting analysis (Fig. ) demonstrated that 631 K SGLT2 expression was significantly lower than that of wild-type SGLT2–GFP (0.24 ± 0.14 vs. 1, P = 0.002, n = 4, Fig. ). Confocal imaging revealed that both the wild-type and mutant fusion proteins were expressed in a punctate pattern in the cell membrane, which merged well with the cell membrane marker 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIC18(3), Fig. ).
The function of wild-type SGLT2–GFP and 631 K SGLT2–GFP fusion proteins in cultured HEK293 cells was confirmed by transport of the glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3- diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), evaluated by fluorescence intensity using flow cytometry. 2-NBDG uptake in HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type SGLT2–GFP was increased about 3.5-fold compared with those transfected with GFP-only control vector (7926 ± 1153 vs. 2314 ± 791, P < 0.001, n = 4, Fig. ). The uptake activity of the mutant SGLT2 631 K-GFP fusion protein was significantly decreased compared with wild-type SGLT2–GFP (3629 ± 1082 vs. 7926 ± 1153, P < 0.001, n = 4, Fig. ).
The Medical Ethics Committee of the Inner Mongolia People’s Hospital and Peking University approved the protocol. Data were compared with the t-test or analysis of variance followed by Fisher’s least significant difference methods for multiple comparisons. Data are shown as the mean ± SD, and significant differences were declared at P < 0.05.
Kidney proximal tubules reabsorb almost 180 g glucose daily, which is filtered through the glomeruli. SGLT2 accounts for most glucose reabsorption. It is responsible for the active transport of glucose across the brush border membrane, and is expressed almost exclusively in the kidney []. Recent studies have reported that SLC5A2 mutations are causative of FRG [, , –]. The long-term outcome of FRG patients is excellent, so SGLT2 inhibitors have been the subject of particular attention for the treatment of diabetes [, ]. Although research into FRG may help with a breakthrough for diabetes treatment, expression and functional studies of SLC5A2 mutations in FRG are rare, and the role of SGLT2 C-terminal mutations needs further clarification.
A previous study [] suggested that overt glucosuria requires the individual to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for SLC5A2 mutations. Consistent with this, our patient with a heterozygous mutation had “mild” glucosuria (urine glucose excretion, 7.56 g/day). However, our findings still imply that the mutation causes a clinically relevant SGLT2 dysfunction. Our in vitro study of 293 cells showed that the transport activity of the mutant SGLT2 631 K-GFP fusion proteins was significantly lower than that of wild-type. SLC5A2 mutations may reduce or abolish transporter activity by impairing protein synthesis, processing, or insertion into the plasma membrane. Furthermore, transporter activity may be reduced or abolished by accelerating protein removal or degradation, altering functional regulation, or impairing intrinsic activity. The mutant SGLT2 631 K–GFP in our study had a similar punctate membrane expression pattern to wild-type, but a decreased expression intensity. Thus, the mutation (c.1891G > A/p.E631K) is likely to impair protein synthesis or accelerate protein removal or degradation. Our results also suggest that the SGLT2 C-terminal is very important for protein expression levels. We speculate that the reduced expression of the SGLT2 mutant is responsible for the decreased transport activity of mutant SGLT2.
Although it was not possible to perform a family study in the present case, identification of mutations that cause glucosuria will enable the establishment of a genotypic FRG diagnosis, providing important information for families and physicians. In general, renal biopsies are unnecessary for FRG patients, so the effect of the 631 K mutation on SGLT2 expression in the kidney is still unknown. We were restricted to an in vitro study of the expression and function of SGLT2 using GFP as a fluorescent label because we previously found that the SGLT2 antibody was unsuited to use in 293 cells, COS-7 cells, and Xenopus laevis oocytes.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?,"{'Chloride': [138.5, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [42.8, 'g/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [19.4, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [139.8, 'mmol/L']}",-6.7,-7.04,-6.37,"The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 139.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 139.8 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 139.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 139.8 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.8 mmol sodium/L converts to 139.8 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 138.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 138.5 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.5 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.5 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.5 mmol chloride/L converts to 138.5 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 19.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 19.4 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 19.4 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 19.4 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 19.4 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 19.4 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.8 mEq/L - (138.5 mEq/L + 19.4 mEq/L) = -18.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -18.1 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 42.8 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 42.8 g albumin/10.0 dL = 4.28 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 42.8 g albumin/L converts to 4.28 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -18.1 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.28 (in g/dL)) = -18.8 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is -18.8 mEq/L.
Plugging in -18.8 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get -18.8 - 12 = -30.8 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -30.8 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -30.8 mEq/L / 4.600000000000001 mEq/L = -6.7. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is -6.7."

Preoperative enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a para-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 58 × 63 mm. The axillary artery was densely calcified, but the AAO was not obvious since the contrast medium was injected from the left upper extremity during preoperative enhanced CT, and this caused severe halation at the axillar/subclavian vein, which made visualization of the adjacent left subclavian artery difficult or impossible.
We planned EVAR for her para-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm using the snorkel technique in the renal arteries. We attempted cannulation of the renal artery approaching from the left brachial artery, but failed to pass through the left subclavian artery because of AAO.

The patient was treated out of hospital with frequent meals rich in carbohydrates during the day and every 2–3 h during the night and as a result she developed obesity. Besides nutritional therapy, she was also treated with allopurinol for hyperuricaemia. She came to our clinic at the age of 22 years for the diagnostic evaluation of arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Her weight was initially 80 kg, height was 157 cm and BMI was 32.5. The levels of uric acid were 425 nmol/l, LDL 3 mmol/l, HDL 0.8 mmol/l, cholesterol 5.2 mmol/l and TG 2 mmol/l.

She denied diarrhea, constipation, fever, and chills. She reported no similar episodes in the past and denied the consumption of non-food items.
Physical examination revealed a thin, uncomfortable appearing young woman. Her weight was 99 pounds and height was 61 inches. Her temperature was 98.6°F, pulse was 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg. The abdomen was distended, firm, and diffusely tender to palpation without peritonitis. All other examination findings were non-contributory.
Laboratory abnormalities included potassium 3.1 mEq/L, amylase 210 U/L, and lipase 114 U/L. Remaining chemistries and a complete blood count were normal. Abdominal plain film showed a grossly distended stomach filled with extensive food matter []. There was no abdominal free air. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enlarged stomach, measuring 32 cm × 17.9 cm, displacing the small bowel into the right lower quadrant and the transverse colon into the pelvis [].
The patient underwent a laparotomy (through a small epigastric midline incision) which revealed a massively distended stomach. Anterior gastrotomy showed that the stomach was filled with nearly 2 gallons of partially and minimally digested food including whole pasta shells and vegetable matter. Due to the large size and thick consistency of the stomach contents, they were removed via a 40-Fr. chest tube secured in the gastrotomy site, with gentle massage of stomach contents through the tube into a basin. Following adequate decompression, the tube was removed, the stomach mobilized out of the wound, the remaining contents emptied, and the gastrotomy closed. No discrete bezoar or mechanical gastric outlet obstruction was identified. Of note, the gastric wall was poorly perfused due to the massive distention, and the site of gastrotomy showed patchy necrosis even after decompression. Thus, a portion of the anterior wall was resected to viable appearing tissues to allow for safe closure of the gastrotomy. Pathology of the excised gastric wall showed gastric mucosal necrosis.
The following day, the patient admitted to a massive 1-hour binge prior to presentation, and revealed a history of anorexia nervosa and binge eating. At age 14, she had been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype. Although she had not engaged in binge eating for 4 years, she attributed this episode to alcohol intoxication and stress.
Postoperatively, a nasogastric tube was left in place for gastric decompression, and a post-pyloric feeding tube in case of gastric ileus after the extreme distension.

7783,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-5296392-1,Extracted,"A 22-years-old female patient at height of 171 cm and weight of 67 kg visited the Department of Breast Surgery of the hospital with a mass accompanied with pain on the left side breast as chief complaints. Since physical examination findings suspected a huge mass, breast surgeon decided to perform surgical excision and requested anesthesia to our department. There were no other specific findings from preoperative assessment. The patient feared general anesthesia. Therefore, we decided to perform resection under regional anesthesia considering that there would be no particular problem if the somatosensory pain could be managed and the surgical site was restrained on the left side breast. On the day before surgery, these matters were explained to the patient and the guardian. We also obtained the informed consent.
No premedication was administered. When the patient arrived at the operation theater, monitoring devices including electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure monitor, and pulse oximeter were attached to the patient.
Before the patient was sedated, ultrasound-guided Pecs II block and IIPB were performed with the patient in supine position. Skin was disinfected. Ultrasound probe and cable were protected with a sterile ultrasound probe cover. Transportable ultrasound equipment with a 50 mm linear 15–6 MHz probe (SonoSite M-Turbo™, SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) was used. The probe was placed below the lateral third of the clavicle. Skin puncture site was infiltrated with 2% lidocaine. Block was then performed by using a 22-gauge Quincke needle (BD Spinal Needle, BD Medical, New Jersey, USA). The needle was advanced to the neurovascular plane between the pectoralis major and minor muscles at the vicinity of the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial artery and 10 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected (). In a similar way, 20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected at the level of the 4th rib in the mid-axillary line between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles (SAM) (). And 10 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected at the level of the 4th costal cartilage space over the internal intercostal muscle ().
At 15 minutes after performing the block, we checked sensory loss through cold test. According to the patient's wish to sleep, propofol was infused by using a target controlled infusion (TCI, Orchestra®, Fresenius Vial, Brezins, France) by setting it to Schnider model. It was started from the effect-site concentration TCI of 1.5 µg/ml. It was then slowly increased toward the target point of Observer's Assessment Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale 2–3 level. The surgery started at 25 minutes after performing the block. Operation time was 1.5 hours. Anesthesia time was 2 hours and 15 minutes. Intraoperative vital signs were stable. No opioid was needed. The patient did not complain postoperative pain of the surgical site. Her numerical rating scale of pain was 0/10.",What is the patient's body surface area?

8752,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-3404937-1,Extracted,"The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian man. He is 1.61 meters tall and weighs 66 kilograms. After working as a car mechanic for 36 years, he had been receiving disability benefits for 11 years. He was working part-time as a caretaker averaging 10 hours per week until two and a half years ago. At the age of 35, the patient began having bouts of severe back pain approximately twice a year. When these episodes occurred, he took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for three to four weeks for pain relief. At the age of 40, lumbar spondylolisthesis was diagnosed by radiography. At the age of 50, he suddenly developed severe right hip pain. He suffered from substantial arthrosis on the right side, which was treated with a total hip replacement one year later.
Three years ago, he began to develop neurological symptoms in both hands. Pain and loss of function of his fingers prevented him from working as a caretaker. The pain radiated from his neck bilaterally down to his fingers and was described as parasthesia-like in nature. He also complained of weakness in his hands. Left hand digit flexion was classified as J1 and right hand as J4. Digit extension was classified as J4 on the left and J2 on the right and abduction on the left was classified as J0 and on the right as J1. The patient also had difficulty walking (Nurick 4, EMS 10/18) as he had to support himself using his surroundings in order to stand upright and was unable to walk unassisted. He was referred to a neurologist by his general practitioner who in turn referred him to a neurosurgeon. Radiographs (Figure ) magnetic resonance imaging (Figure ) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a spondylolisthesis between C7 and T1. Using the Meyerding classification [], which was initially developed for grading the degree of lumbar spondylolisthesis, the patient would have been diagnosed with a cervico-thoracic spondylolisthesis of the second or third degree. The spondylolisthesis, measured using the method developed by Kawasaki et al. [], was 13 mm. In view of the special nature of the case, a collaborative treatment between neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons was favored and subsequently implemented.
The surgical management was performed as follows:
The patient was placed in the supine position. The intervertebral disk at C7-T1 was exposed using blunt dissection. The disk was then removed to the point of the ligamentum flavum. A subsequent resection of the lateral parts of the intervertebral discs significantly mobilized the spondylolisthesis.
The wound was closed and the patient was rotated to the prone position. First, the dislocation between vertebras C7 and T1 was reduced while positioning the head.
Subsequently, the lateral masses were prepared from a dorsal approach between C5 and T3. Then, lateral mass-screws were inserted into C5 and C6. We had noticed considerable laxity between C6 and C7. In addition, C5 and C6 were naturally fused and we decided to include them in the instrumentation. There was also a rigid displacement between C7 and T1.
Bicortical screws were then inserted into the transverse processes of T2 and T3. These were inserted into at least two segments from both sides in divergent directions. The length of these screws was 10 to 12 mm, with a diameter of 3.2 mm.
This was followed by a laminectomy. Since the roots of C7 and C8 were exposed, the lateral masses of C7 and C8 had to be resected. Longitudinal rods were placed. Proper reduction in lordosis and the preservation of a 5 mm intervertebral space between C7 and T1 were confirmed by radiograph. Set screws were used to fix the instrumentation in the desired position. Chips of cortical and cancellous bone were placed lateral to the longitudinal rods.
The dorsal wound was then closed. The patient was again rotated to the supine position to reopen the ventral wound. Now, instead of the previously seen displacement, a large gap was visible between C7 and T1. The endplates between C7 and T1 were milled and the ligamentum flavum was resected using punches. Then, the spinal canal was exposed completely, using a Caspar opener.
Subsequently, a Harms basket, filled with autograft bone chips, was inserted into the intervertebral space. Three drains were placed and the wound was closed. For prophylactic infection control, the patient was perioperatively given intravenous 1.5 g cefuroxime twice a day for the next four days. Intraoperative and postoperative radiographs (Figure and ) were taken to confirm correct placement of the instrumentation.
Following the operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. His vital signs were stable enough for him to be transferred to the general postoperative recovery ward on the fourth postoperative day. Eleven days after surgery, the patient left the hospital and entered an orthopedic and neurologic rehabilitation program.
The pain and parasthesias in his fingers resolved after the operation. Two months postoperatively, his ability to walk had noticeably improved after completing his rehabilitation program (Nurick 3).
Today, two years postoperatively, the patient is able to walk without assistance (Nurick 2). Flexion of the fingers on his left hand was graded as J3 and as J5 on the right hand. Extension of the fingers on his left hand was graded as J4 and as J2 on the right. Abduction was graded as J4 for his left hand and as J2 for his right hand (EMS 14/18).","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [66.0, 'kg'], 'height': [1.61, 'm']}",61.073,58.019,64.127,"The patient's gender is Male.
The patient's height is 1.61 m, which is 1.61 m * 39.3701 in/m = 63.386 in. 
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (63.386 (in inches) - 60) = 57.788 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 57.788 kg.The patient's weight is 66.0 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 57.788 kg + 0.4 * (66.0 kg  - 57.788 kg) = 61.073 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 61.073 kg."
336,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-4602609-1,Extracted,"A 55-year-old white male was referred to our outpatient clinic because of a computed tomography (CT) finding of a large abdominal mass and left inguinal adenopathy. No significant medical history was reported. At our evaluation, he reported a remittent and dull pain on his left flank, which had prompted a further diagnostic evaluation by his general practitioner. Laboratory values were notable for mild anemia (Hb = 13.1 g/dL; normal range, 14–16 g/dL), moderate lymphopenia (620/mm3, normal range, 1000–3500/mm3), and raised serum creatinine levels (1.7 mg/dL). Serum LDH levels were normal (348 U/L, normal range, 100–450 U/L), as serum electrophoresis and liver function. The CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed multiple scattered nodular lesions in the lungs (the greater of which measured 1.6 cm); marked left hydronephrosis was present, caused by a diffuse thickening of the pelvic connective tissue, compressing the left ureter and surrounding the bladder, the prostate, and ileopsoas muscles. Multiple left inguinal adenopathies were evident, the larger of which measured 2.6 cm. A biopsy of the most accessible inguinal lymph node had been performed, but no evidence of malignant lymphoma was found at histological examination. Given the strong clinical suspicion for a neoplastic disease, a new biopsy of the largest inguinal adenopathy was performed, which exhibited fat necrosis and chronic granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. At the positron emission tomography (PET) scan, both the pelvic masses and the pulmonary nodules showed remarkable metabolic avidity to 18-FDG (Fig. ). A diagnostic bone marrow biopsy was proposed, but the patient refused the procedure. After these tests and before a new clinical evaluation, the patient developed acute abdominal pain with fever and was hospitalized in a nearby local clinic. An urgent laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative examination did not confirm the finding of an intraabdominal mass seen at the CT scan; a large pelvic abscess was instead found, with evidence of colonic perforation, bladder-colonic fistula, and completely necrotic bladder. Large adenopathies were also absent. Surgical intervention included partial colonic, total bladder, and omental resection with terminal colostomy to the left side, suturing of the remaining bladder, and fashioning of a bilateral nephrostomy. All the surgical specimens were submitted for pathological examination.
Grossly, the intestinal wall appeared thickened and hardened with a 3-cm large perforation. The cut surface was whitish with areas of frank necrosis and the overlying mucosa featured erosions and ulcerations. The bladder wall appeared extensively necrotic.
On histology, the intestinal submucosa and muscularis propria layer displayed a mild small lymphocytic infiltrate within an edematous and necrotic stroma, with scattered atypical mononuclear larger cells, sometimes provided with a conspicuous nucleolus and a relatively abundant cytoplasm. In the intestine, the large cells were B lymphocytes (CD20+/CD79a+/CD3−) with strong IRF4 expression and active cycling (Ki67 80%). No clear-cut expression of germinal center markers (BCL6 and CD10), CD30, BCL2, and κ or λ light chains could be observed, although no positive internal controls were present for BCL6. The immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus and in situ hybridization (ISH) for EBER proved negative. The accompanying population of small lymphocytes was mainly composed of CD3+ cells with both helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) phenotype, and rare CD20+ B cells (Fig. ). T lymphocytes did not display evident cytological abnormalities; regular representation of other T-cell markers (CD2, CD5, CD7; Fig. ) was observed; molecular studies for clonal rearrangement of TCR-gamma gene proved negative (Supplementary Fig. 1S, ). Molecular studies for clonal rearrangement of IgH gene did not provide any reliable result, likely because of the abundant coagulative necrosis and tissue autolytic degeneration. The specimen from the bladder showed extensively necrotic tissue with scattered lymphoid infiltration and no evidence of large atypical cells.
The histological and immunohistochemical features of the lymphoid infiltrate prompted the differential diagnosis between a primary aggressive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and an abnormal inflammatory hyper-reaction with secondary perforation and involvement of the colonic and bladder wall, in the light of the referred absence of a properly defined mass at surgical examination and presence of a large abscess instead.
After the intervention, the patient entered a septic state confirmed by repeated findings of Gram-negative bacteria from blood and abdominal drainage cultures. Notwithstanding extensive antibacterial treatment, the septic state persisted. The finding of increasing pulmonary nodules at the chest CT scan prompted the execution of a transbronchial biopsy of a 3-cm nodular lesion in the left lung, which resulted nondiagnostic. Also, pleural fluid obtained from thoracentesis proved sterile, and cytological examination of the sediment did not find cells. Given the strong suspicion for B-cell lymphoma, the resistance to multiple antibacterial treatments, and the evidence for growing abdominal and pulmonary lesions, the possibility of a treatment with Rituximab was discussed. However, owing to the poor clinical conditions, the patient was deemed unfit even for this treatment.
Approximately 2 months after the hospitalization, the patient developed a massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. He underwent immediate surgical intervention, but attempt to stop the bleeding was unsuccessful. The patient died during the intervention. A large mass in the left iliac fossa was found and sent for pathological examination (Figs. and ).
On histology, the sample was diffusely necrotic and edematous, with a dispersed loose mixed lymphocytic and granulocytic inflammatory infiltrate within which large cells, cytologically more atypical than those previously observed in the intestine, were seen, either scattered singly or focally surrounding small blood vessels as perivascular cuffs. These cells expressed CD20, IRF4, and BCL6, with negativity for CD3, CD10, and BCL2. The strong diffuse positivity for the c-Myc protein (>90%) and the extremely high Ki67-index confirmed the aggressive nature of the neoplastic process. Again, ISH for EBER proved negative and the clonal rearrangement of IgH genes was not assessable.
A diagnosis of an extranodal EBV-negative high-grade large B-cell lymphoma with massive necrosis and angiocentric pattern of growth was addressed, although the unique histological features did not allow to classify this tumor within any of the recognized WHO entities.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [55, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.7, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",47.02,44.669,49.371,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 55 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.7/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**55 * 1.0 = 47.02.
Hence, the GFR value is 47.02 ml/min/1.73 m²."

The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient’s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.
Though initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.
In the ED, the patient’s temperature was 103.9°F (39.9°C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.
Initial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 × 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0–10.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0–18.0], platelet count of 135 × 103/mm3 [lab range 150–350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137–145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98–107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0–30.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9–20], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7–1.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70–99], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0–10]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0–0.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38–126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13–69), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15–46). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5–10 WBC, 0–5 red blood cells (RBC), 5–10 epithelial cells, 5–10 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.
Due to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40–70], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12–60], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.
A chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure 
). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure 
). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.
Given the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure 
, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure 
. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient’s mental status.
Over the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient’s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient’s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.
On hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [159.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [134.0, 'mmol/L']}",135.416,128.645,142.187,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 159.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (159.0 - 100) = 135.416 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 135.416 mEq/L."

His blood pressure on presentation was 164/78 mmHg, and he was found to have a left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and an incidental right parietal arteriovenous malformation []. He was medically managed with aggressive antihypertensive therapy and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation center with stable right-sided weakness (strength diffusely 4/5) within a few days.
He was readmitted 1 month later with severe headaches and worsening right-sided weakness (3-/5 strength) with a blood pressure of 148/73 mmHg. A head computed tomography (CT) revealed an increase in size of the left parietal hemorrhage. At that time, he also experienced epistaxis as well as catheter site bleeding that resolved spontaneously. Laboratory workup showed a stable platelet count of 127 × 109/L, normal factor X activity (338%), normal von Willebrand factor activity (736%), and a mildly elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4 for which he was given intravenous (IV) Vitamin K (phytonadione). Interval imaging demonstrated stability of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage; however, due to concern for seizures and altered mental status, he had a prolonged hospitalization on the neurology service. He was subsequently discharged back to rehabilitation with an antiepileptic drug regimen of levetiracetam (2000 mg twice daily), clobazam (20 mg twice daily), and lacosamide (50 mg daily).
The patient was readmitted 2 months later to our institution for worsening encephalopathy. A head CT showed a mild increase in ventricular size in addition to the resolving left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. An electroencephalogram and extensive metabolic and infectious workup were unremarkable. Given the possibility of delayed hydrocephalus as explanation for his worsening encephalopathy, the patient was trialed on cerebrospinal fluid diversion with an EVD []. However, 5 days after EVD placement, routine interval imaging revealed a hemorrhage along the tract of the EVD. The tract hemorrhage continued to increase in size over the next few days [-]. Laboratory workup revealed mildly low platelets to 110 × 109/L, a normal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 30.8, and an INR of 1.4. He was given 3 days of IV phytonadione; however, his INR did not normalize. Given the expansion of the tract hemorrhage and his underlying AL amyloidosis with cirrhosis, further coagulopathy testing was pursued. This revealed a low factor VII level (38%), a normal factor II level (69%), a normal factor IX level (69%), a normal factor X level (65%), and elevated factor VIII (166%) and von Willebrand factor (421%) levels. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (20 mcg/kg every 2 h for 3 doses) was administered to promote clot formation and achieve hemostasis. He also had normalization of factor VII levels to 122%. A head CT performed a day later revealed stability of the tract hemorrhage [ and ]. Two days later, he developed an acute worsening of examination with fixed pupils and extensor posturing. Repeat imaging revealed development of a new acute subdural hemorrhage []. He was found to have low factor VII level to 31%. He underwent a left hemicraniectomy and was given rFVII (20 mcg/kg every 2 h for 3 doses) and placed on a continuous infusion of aminocaproic acid at 1 g/h intraoperatively which stabilized the bleeding. He was continued on the aminocaproic acid infusion postoperatively throughout his hospital stay. Despite evacuation of the hematoma and bleeding stabilization, his mental status did not improve.

2253,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-7530739-2,Extracted,"The patient was a 7 year-old boy (107 cm, 16.4 kg). Disease onset occurred at the age of 2 months. Although IVIG was administered three times after IVIG and methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the inflammatory responses persisted, and bilateral coronary artery aneurysms were found 1 week after admission. The patient was transferred to our hospital on disease day 17. After admission to the intensive care unit, the patient was intubated to maintain sedation, and the heart rate and blood pressure were suppressed using nicardipine and sedatives. Despite those therapies, large aneurysms were detected at all three coronary arteries. At 3 months of age, 1 month from disease onset, there were no symptoms, but deepQ wave in lead III on ECG suggested ischemic changes and the troponin and CK-MB levels were elevated on blood test. We diagnosed the patient with AMI, and CAG was performed. On CAG, a huge long segmental aneurysm on RCA was observed with a maximum diameter of 12 mm, the blood flow was almost arrested, and the presence of a thrombus was confirmed (). On the left side, the aneurysmal size on LAD was 9.2 mm and that on LCX was 3.3 mm.
Emergency ICT using t-PA was performed for the RCA thrombus. The thrombus disappeared on the echocardiogram; however, the fever persisted, and infliximab was administered on day 18. The body temperature began to decline on the next day, and the heart rate stabilized. One week later, the patient was extubated, and sedation was discontinued. Therapy was continued with aspirin, ARB, and warfarin. Thereafter, the patient underwent regular follow-up evaluations with ECG, chest radiography, echocardiography, and coronary angiography.
At 1 year of age, 10 months after the acute phase, CAG revealed that the main RCA was completely occluded. However, peripheral blood flow was maintained from the LCX. The LAD vessel diameter still had aneurysmal change, but the diameter improved to 5 mm, no stenotic lesion was detected, and LCX also returned to its normal size. Subsequently, CAG exhibited similar findings as those observed at 1 year after the acute phase. At 2 years of age, 2 years from disease onset, CAG was performed and similar findings were observed. At that time, his body weight was <15 kg, and we speculated that performing CABG using RITA would be difficult at this age. Thus, CABG was postponed. After CAG, he went to the hospital for a regular check-up and underwent exercise ECG. He did not complain of any discomforts or chest pains, even while performing exercises at school. However, at 7 years of age (weight, 16.4 kg), 7 years from onset, he lost consciousness while exercising and underwent another CAG. The LAD was completely occluded and stenosis of the LCX of 0.9 mm was observed. Drug-loaded myocardial scintigraphy showed extensive ischemia of the sidewall; however, the left ventricular EF was maintained at 70%. He had symptoms and sufficient weight and ischemic findings on examination to warrant surgery. Then, CABG was performed. Anastomosis was performed at the following two places: LITA-LAD and RCA-GEA. However, the LITA was too small to be skeletonized; thus, anastomosis was performed using only milrinone injection. The RITA was also preserved for future stenotic episodes. Angiography performed at ~1 year after surgery showed a good blood flow in both vessels ().

The morning of presentation, the patient awoke fussy and subsequently began to vomit. His mother witnessed a clot in the emesis with frank hematemesis with continued bleeding coming from the oropharynx, and she transported him via personal vehicle to the hospital. Upon arrival, the patient was afebrile at 37.5ºC, with a heart rate of 137 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, blood pressure of 111/85 millimeters mercury (mm Hg), and weight of 12 kilograms (kg). On exam, the patient appeared pale and tachycardic with active retching, and with blood pooled in the posterior oropharynx that obscured visualization of the tonsillar beds.
A complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, and type and cross were obtained, and ondansetron was administered intravenously (IV). A cold-water rinse was attempted; however, the patient did not tolerate this intervention. Nebulized TXA was administered by using 250 milligrams (mg) (50mg/per milliliter) IV solution via direct nebulization at a flow rate of eight liters over four minutes without additive of normal saline solution. After administration of TXA, the patient had no obvious bleeding from the posterior pharynx and his retching improved. He was then admitted to the general pediatric inpatient service for further monitoring with pediatric otolaryngology (ENT) consultation. The CBC and coagulation studies were within the normal range on admission with hemoglobin 12.0 grams per deciliter (gm/dL) (normal range 11.5–14.5 gm/dL), prothrombin time (PT) 13.8 seconds (sec) (11.7–14.7 sec), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 33.3 sec (25–35 sec).
These lab tests were not repeated during his hospitalization. After an initial refusal of oral intake requiring maintenance IV fluids the patient was able to be transitioned to a soft diet, which he tolerated, and he was discharged on hospital day three. He had no further bleeding, and no adverse effects from nebulized TXA were documented. The patient’s initial surgery was performed at an outside facility, and no follow-up visits were done at our institution for review.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?","{'weight': [12.0, 'kg']}",44.0,41.8,46.2,"The patient's weight is 12.0 kg.

Her vital signs were normal, with a heart rate of 80 beats/min and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. However, her blood urea nitrogen (179.4 (reference range: 8–23) mg/dL) and serum creatinine (10.9 (reference range: 0.5–1.3) mg/dL) levels were markedly increased, with her serum inorganic phosphate level also higher than normal at 8.4 (reference range: 2.5–5.5) mg/dL. The patient was treated with emergent hemodialysis and a living-donor kidney transplantation, from her father, was planned.
During the pre-transplantation medical work-up, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass, 1.7 cm in diameter, located in the upper pole of the right kidney (Fig. A). On follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the mass presented high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, with heterogeneous enhancement in the right kidney (Fig. B and C). Based on findings of the MR imaging, a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, stage T1aN0, was made. As the right renal mass was small, with no associated symptoms, simultaneous right radical nephrectomy and kidney transplant was planned by the transplant surgeon and urologist. Open radical nephrectomy was performed via a subcostal incision; the patient was then positioned for the kidney transplant. Hematoxylin and eosin staining performed after nephrectomy revealed irregularly shaped vascular spaces of various sizes, with an anastomosing pattern (Fig. A). On immunostaining, the sample was positive for CD34, CD31, and ETS-related genes and for friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor and negative for podoplanin, human herpes virus-8, and glucose transporter-1 on immunostaining (Fig. B–D).

The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L.

His medical history was acute pancreatitis at age 17 and hypertension at age 40, and the family history indicated that his nephew had IgA nephropathy. The patient occasionally consumes alcohol, but doesn’t smoke. The patient visited a local doctor and underwent a renal biopsy for suspected active nephritis because of the finding (Table ) of hematuria 3+ protein from pooled urine 0.78 g/day and a plasma creatinine (Cr) level of 1.16 mg/dl [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 71 ml/min/1.73 m2]. Pathologic examination revealed IgA nephropathy with partial cellular crescent formation in 1 of the 12 glomeruli, slight mesangial matrix expansion, and mild atrophy of the renal tubule and interstitium. He was followed up without treatment, and the urinary abnormalities resolved spontaneously. He stopped visiting the hospital 3 years after the first visit because of the repeated negative urine analysis and did not visit any other hospital thereafter. He continued to undergo routine medical examinations, which were intermittently positive for microhematuria and proteinuria. His next visit to a medical institution was in 2002 at 38 years of age and revealed urine protein 2+, urine occult blood 1+, plasma Cr 1.13 mg/dl and hypertension. An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was started. After that, he saw a doctor regularly, but hematuria and proteinuria became gradually worse. A relapse of IgA nephropathy was suspected. In March 2009, he was admitted to a hospital for renal biopsy to evaluate the progression of IgA nephropathy.
The patient's general condition at the time of hospitalization was height 163.0 cm, weight 55.0 kg, body mass index 20.7 kg/m2, blood pressure 116/72 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats/min and temperature 36.6 °C. He was lucid with no sign of anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva. No swelling of the throat, abnormal chest auscultation, hard and tender points in the abdominal area or edema of the extremities was observed. Medical examinations (Table ) revealed urine protein 3+ (0.90 g/day), urine occult blood 3+ (RBC 10–19/HPF) and serum Cr 1.63 mg/dl.
Renal biopsy (Fig. ) showed 4 global scleroses, 3 cellular crescent formations and 3 adhesions in 28 glomeruli; moderate expansion of the mesangial matrix; moderate tubular atrophy with mild cell infiltration in the interstitium; and moderate arteriolosclerosis and thickening of interlobular arteries. Immunostaining of IgA confirmed the diagnosis of active chronic-progressive IgA nephropathy.
After admission, the patient was treated with tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy. Steroid pulse therapy was given as follows: methylprednisolone was administered continuously at a pulsed dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg continuously for 3 weeks. After completion of the third course, oral prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 30 mg/day every other day after treatment and tapered by 5 mg every 2 months. The after-treatment follow-up was continued for 1 year. The patient underwent tonsillectomy after discharge from the hospital (day 75) and was then followed up at the outpatient clinic. He completed oral prednisolone treatment in approximately a year, but continued taking an ARB during the follow-up period.

The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 43 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.63 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 163.0 cm, which is 163.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.63 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.63 m * 1.63 m) = 20.701 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.7, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 55.0 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 43) * 55.0 * 1) / (1.63 * 72) = 45.458 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 45.458 mL/min."

He had a colonoscopy due to the presence of blood in his stools for a month prior to his admission. Endoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion of the rectum and the pathology diagnosed an adenocarcinoma.
From his medical history, we ascertained that he had pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 25 years, cholocystectomy at the age of 61 and that he currently had ischemic heart disease. The patient had no history of tobacco smoking and no allergies. Laboratory tests were normal. Preoperative staging was negative on abdominal and chest computed tomography scans. The patient did not receive neoadjuvant therapy.
A laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed with an end-to-end anastomosis. The operation was converted to an open laparotomy due to technical problems in the completion of the anastomosis and the intraoperative observation of oozing from the presacral fascia. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum with adequate resection margins and no metastases in the 16 resected lymph nodes. By World Health Organisation classification, this was a T3N0 M0 tumor.
The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed abdominal pain and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed tachycardia (130 beats per minute), hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 210 mmHg) and fever (38.1°C). The patient had a normal blood count and hypoxia was diagnosed on arterial blood gases (saturation 88%, PO2 56 mmHg). He received intramuscular analgesics (pethidine 75 mg four times daily) and intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 gm and metronidazole 500 mg three times daily).
The patient underwent an emergent laparotomy on the same day. Anastomotic rupture with fecal peritonitis was diagnosed. Intraperitoneal lavage and a loop ileostomy were performed. Two drain catheters were placed in the pelvis next to the anastomosis and the abdomen was left open for a delayed closure using the Bogota bag technique. Intraoperatively, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest and he was successfully resuscitated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanically ventilated. He was hemodynamically unstable.
On the seventh day, the patient underwent a second laparotomy, and then returned to the ICU. Due to persistent hyperpyrexia, tachycardia and metabolic acidosis unresponsive to supportive measures, the patient was taken back to the operating theatre for a third laparotomy. Exploration of the peritoneal cavity was negative. We performed peritoneal lavage and three drains were placed in the pelvis. Using the Bogota bag technique, the abdominal wall was left open. The patient was transferred to the ICU again.
Five days later, we detected intestinal content in one of the drain catheters - the patient was hemodynamically stable but his condition was not improving. At that time, abdominal hypertension developed (21 mmHg) accompanied by acute renal failure. It was decided that the patient should undergo another exploratory laparotomy some days later. Fecal peritonitis and pseudomembranes were recognized and a peritoneal lavage with warm saline was performed. The anastomosis was taken down and the rectal stump was closed. Omentum was placed in the lesser pelvis. A proximal sigmoidostomy was performed along with reconstruction of the loop ileostomy. Two drains were placed in the pelvis. The abdominal fascia was left open with skin closure. The patient was intubated and transferred back to the ICU.
The patient developed multi-organ dysfunction requiring mechanical ventilation, inotropic support and renal replacement therapy in his 40 days in the ICU. 17 days after the last laparotomy, he was tracheostomized and was transferred to a hospital ward after 75 days in the ICU. He was on a T-piece and receiving enteral feeding through a Levin tube. Multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. He was discharged from the hospital and transferred to a rehabilitation center after 3 months of supportive therapy.

His medical history was positive for coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was performed on him, about 45 days prior to admission. He was relatively well when he developed abdominal pain accompanied by anorexia and nausea. The patient had sought medical attention for his abdominal discomfort, and bilateral large solid adrenal masses were detected in his abdominal ultrasonography. He also mentioned an unintentional weight loss and generalized darkening of the skin during this period.
He was admitted to the under study hospital with the impression of adrenal failure. Serum sample for basal cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was taken in the basal state, and then, after giving 250 μg of synthetic ACTH, serum cortisol was measured again. He responded to administration of high doses of intravenous hydrocortisone with remission of symptoms. On admission, clinical examination revealed low blood pressure (90/60 mmHg), body temperature 37°C, the pulse rate 88 beat/minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breath/ minute. He looked well and was in no acute distress. There was generalized increased pigmentation of the skin. No Cushingoid appearance was detected and there was no palpable lymph node. Physical examination of lungs and heart were unremarkable and his abdomen was flat without palpable mass or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations revealed normal liver function test, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, white blood cell 8.5 × 103, with normal differential count and platelet 200 × 103. Blood chemistries showed Na 125 mEq/L, K 5.2 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 35 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) 1.8 mg/dL, normal blood sugar, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1277 U/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 110 mm/hour, and normal lipase and amylase levels. The ultrasound of the abdomen revealed bilateral large solid adrenal masses without lymphadenopathy or organomegaly.
A contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with adrenal protocol demonstrated bilateral large heterogeneously enhancing adrenal lesions, 8.5 × 6.5 cm in the Rt. and 7.5 × 5.7 cm in the left adrenal, without calcification ().
The masses were non-homogeneous and their precontrast Hounsfield score was 65 in the left and 73 in the right side. Also, there was no significant washout of the contrast agent and no other pathology was detected. Since adrenal metastasis from an unknown malignant disease was suspected, CT scan of the chest and pelvis was performed and no primary tumor was found. His upper endoscopy and colonoscopy also revealed no abnormal finding. Further biochemical evaluation showed normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, U/mL, β-hCG, and CEA, and low dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) levels and 24-hour urine metanephrines were 4.1 μg/day (0 - 350 μg/day).
Clinical suspicion of primary adrenal insufficiency was confirmed by an elevated baseline plasma ACTH of 99 pg/mL, a low plasma cortisol of 0.7 μg/dL (normal value of 12 - 25 μg/dL) and insufficient peak cortisol response of 1.9 μg/dL to ACTH stimulation (normal value of > 18 μg/dL). Bone marrow examination revealed no abnormality.
The patient was treated with high doses of intravenous hydrocortisone and rehydrated with sodium chloride infusion resulting in complete remission of symptoms and normalization of biochemistry. Subsequently, a CT-guided biopsy of the mass lesion was performed and microscopic examination of the material revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD43, CD79, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and Pax.5, but did not stain for CD3, CK, CK20, and cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). The proliferative fraction detected by Ki-67 was high and the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma was confirmed ().

8407,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-4437790-1,Extracted,"A 28-year-old African woman (72kg, 166cm) with anti-Cromer Tc(a) and anti-Jka antibodies was admitted to the obstetric emergency department at our University Hospital at 31+4 weeks’ gestation for heavy vaginal bleeding. She had a history of two prior at-term cesarean deliveries (in 2006 and 2010) and two voluntary abortions. She had a positive indirect Coombs test near the beginning of pregnancy. Low-titer anti-Tc(a) antibodies had been identified and closely monitored.
A month before admission to our department (at 27+3 weeks’ gestation), she had been hospitalized for cervical shortening (23mm). Ultrasonography at that time had revealed full placenta previa and a high risk for placenta accreta. In accordance with the guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [], the ultrasound report was as follows: “… in grey-scale, a thinning of the hyperechoic serosa–bladder interface and abnormal placental lacunae were found. Moreover, the placental tissue on the left side of the uterus appeared to reach the serosa.” During the initial hospitalization, two injections of betamethasone (12mg) were administered to prevent fetal respiratory distress, and a consulting hematologist requested further immunohematological testing.
Because of the rarity of antibodies of the Cromer blood group system and the high risk of heavy bleeding associated with placenta accreta, it was necessary to establish specific policies for the planned delivery by cesarean section. In preparation, parenteral iron supplementation was administered twice weekly beginning in the 28th week to raise hemoglobin (Hb) values above 12g/dL from an initial Hb of 10.5g/dL. Meanwhile, the Transfusion Medicine Department consultant planned two autologous blood donations because no compatible blood was found in a search of the United States Blood Bank network or the network of European blood banks (World Health Organization International Rare Donor Panel). Unfortunately, the autologous blood could not be collected because of sudden worsening of the patient’s clinical condition.
At her readmission to our Obstetrical Emergency Department, serial ultrasound examinations and fetal monitoring with cardiotocography were performed. Because vaginal bleeding stopped within a few hours in response to tocolytic therapy, the attending physicians decided to maintain a conservative strategy. Elective cesarean delivery was scheduled with multidisciplinary team cooperation because of the extreme complexity of the case. The cesarean section was performed 3 days later, after a long and detailed discussion among anesthesiologists, obstetricians, radiologists, hematologists and intensivists. Her preoperative Hb was 10.2g/dL.
Before cesarean section, the patient provided written informed consent and was brought to the angiography suite (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). We placed two 14-gauge and one 16-gauge peripheral venous catheters and performed radial artery cannulation to monitor intra-arterial pressure throughout the procedures. After local anesthesia of her groin bilaterally, her femoral arteries were punctured with Seldinger technique and 4-Fr sheaths (Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) were placed to allow bilateral cross catheterization of her hypogastric arteries with a C1 “Cobra” catheter (Terumo Leuven, Belgium). Using a 0.035 inch 150cm Amplatz guidewire (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA), the 4-Fr sheaths were exchanged with two 45cm 5-Fr Brite Tip® sheaths (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA), with the distal tips in the anterior branches of both hypogastric arteries. This allowed placement of two Fogarty 80cm 4-Fr balloons over the distal tips of the 5-Fr sheaths, within her uterine arteries. Proper positioning of the Fogarty balloons and the effectiveness of vascular occlusion were confirmed with fluoroscopy (Figure ). Maternal and fetal monitoring were conducted throughout the procedure, without complications.
She was transferred from the angiography suite to the obstetric operating room. A single fluoroscopic image was made with a moveable C-arm to confirm that the Fogarty balloons remained in the proper position. While she underwent the angiographic procedure, the operating room was set up with an intraoperative blood salvage system (Cell Saver®; Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA, USA), a rapid infusion system (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA, USA), fluid warmers (Level 1 H-1200; Smiths Medical, Kent, UK) and forced air warming systems (Bair-Hugger™, 3M, St. Paul, MN, USA). Before anesthetic induction, she received premedication with hydrocortisone (200mg) as recommended by the hematologist in case of emergent need to transfuse incompatible blood. She also received antibiotic prophylaxis and intravenous tranexamic acid (750mg) to prevent peripartum hemorrhage []. Anesthesia was induced with 200mg propofol, 200mcg fentanyl and 40mg rocuronium and was maintained with sevoflurane gas. A low transverse skin incision through her previous cesarean scars and a lower uterine segment incision were performed, avoiding the upper margin of the anterior placenta. Immediately after delivery of the fetus and umbilical cord clamping, the uterine artery balloons were inflated. As per the obstetrician’s request, the uterine arteries were embolized with Gelfoam® sponge (Jinling Pharmaceutical Company, Nanjing, China) to stop bleeding. Because the placenta could not be completely removed as a result of its strong adhesion to the posterior wall of the uterus, and because of the risk of postoperative hemorrhage, the surgeons decided to perform a total hysterectomy, as recommended by Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines []. When adequate hemostatic control was achieved, the balloons were deflated. After the uterine lumen and abdominal cavity were closed and no vaginal bleeding was confirmed, the Fogarty balloons were removed. The 5-Fr sheaths were maintained for 24 hours in case further embolization was necessary. The total intraoperative blood loss was 1000mL and the surgery lasted approximately 150 minutes. During the cesarean section, 150mL of blood was reinfused through the cell salvage technology and limited crystalloid fluid therapy was administered (1L of lactated Ringer’s solution). Her temperature was maintained at approximately 37°C throughout the procedure and serial blood gas analyses were performed to monitor for metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities. Further details of our hemorrhage management protocol have been reported previously [].
After surgery, she was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring of bleeding and coagulation profiles. Immediately after ICU admission, ventilation was optimized, adequate analgesia was provided and she was awakened and extubated. Because no further bleeding was recorded from the abdominal drain, the angiographic 5-Fr sheaths were removed the day after surgery and she was transferred to the obstetric ward with a Hb of 8.9g/dL.
Four days after cesarean section, she was discharged from our hospital with a prescription for oral iron therapy for at least 30 days and plans for blood count recheck 15 days after discharge.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'weight': [72.0, 'kg'], 'height': [166.0, 'cm']}",63.488,60.314,66.662,"The patient's gender is Female.

The onset of pain had been approximately 2-3 days before presentation. He did not have a remarkable past history. He complained of frequency but denied recent trauma or any problems moving his bowels. Although he had visited the outpatient department 2 days before coming to the ED, he was discharged because of normal urine examination and intravenous pyelography results. Because of discomfort with frequency, he visited the ED for medical attention. In the ED, the urine analysis was redone. Similarly, urinalysis did not detect red blood cells in the urine. Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine levels, and white blood cell count were normal. Kidney sonography did not show obvious hydronephrosis. Although he did not complain of dysuria, he did mention increased micturation frequency. He did not seem anxious or hypochondriatic, and he went to the toilet several times during observation.
The MEAD device was then used to record the data in the ED. The meridian electrical conductance was low (14.9 μA; normal range, 30–64 μA). The index of sympathovagal balance was high (3.75; normal range, 1.0–1.5). The ratio of electrical conductance of the left side to the right side bladder meridian was obviously abnormal (L/R: 2.09) (). A urologist was consulted at this time. Unenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) was performed and depicted a tiny calculus at the left ureterovesical junction (). The patient was admitted to the urological service and started on an aggressive hydration regimen in an attempt to “flush” the stone.

2448,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-6528262-1,Extracted,"A 48-year old woman (weight 52 kg, height 152 cm, ASA II) was admitted in Sept 18th 2016 because of a ground glass opacity (GGO) which had been detected in the right lung 2 years ago. She had her left pneumonectomy through uniportal VATS owing to the left upper lobe adenocarcinoma invasive to the left main bronchus in Mar 2014. Her pre-operative diagnoses were GGO in the right upper lobe, suspect for malignancy and left postpneumonectomy (Fig. ). No abnormal findings were detected among other tests, and some of the important figures in the arterial blood gas test were showed as follows: pH 7.44, PaCO2 37 mmHg, PaO2 84 mmHg, SaO2 97.7%. Her pulmonary function test showed FEV1 46.9%, FEV1/FVC 83.3%, and her predicted postoperative FEV1% would be close to 44.7%. Although other tests of evaluating cardiopulmonary reserve function and lung parenchymal function were not performed, her regular 3-floor climbing activity was not compromised. The operation was scheduled as right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal VATS under general anesthesia. Routine monitoring was applied and the first data were recorded as follows: body temperature 36.7 °C, blood pressure 123/70 mmHg, heart rate 86/min and Sp02 98% when the patient was placed in a supine position in the operation room. After the insertion of an 18-gauge intravenous cannula and the right internal jugular vein catheter, intravenous induction was carried out with an injection of midazolam 0.03 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.6 μg/kg, propofol 1 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg. Intubation preparation: the patient was scheduled to have the right anterior segmentectomy through VATS after the left pneumonectomy, which entailed us to make a good balance between ventilation and collapse on the right lung only, to make good use of ventilation in the lower and middle lobes, and to produce an effective collapse in the upper lobar. After a prudent study of the following parameters, the diameter of the narrowest part of the tracheal is 11.9 mm, the length of right upper lobe bronchus is 6.2 mm, the angle of the right main bronchus and right upper lobe bronchus is close to 90 degree, the diameter of the bronchus intermedius is 8.8 mm, and the length of bronchus intermedius is about 15 mm, a 32 Fr left-sided DLT was chosen and adapted (Fig. ). Permission was granted by our hospital ethical committee to adapt the DLTs. The cutting edge of the tube should be smooth and clean, only in this way can we make sure that it won’t do any harm to the airways. One cut (cut just for once) would be best in adapting. Whether the cutting edge is qualified or not can be detected by our sensitive finger tips. And this technique has been proved safe from our experience in tracheal and bronchial operations. The 32Fr left-sided DLTs have been used among short women for left thoracic operations in our facility, and its external diameter is about 10.7 mm, the bronchial internal diameter is about 3.5 mm. But it’s our first time to insert the left-sided DLT to the right for the right lung surgery. As we can see from Fig. , the mediastinum has shifted to the left, the intubation should be gentle and carried out by an experienced anesthesiologist in case of any possible injury or even perforation to the former carina. After induction, we performed a FOB (3.0 mm diameter) guided endobronchial intubation with the bronchial cuff into the right bronchus intermedius, and the tracheal cuff’s orifice up against the upper bronchial port (Fig. ), in this way, the ventilation of the dependent right middle and lower lobes and the collapse of the upper lobar were guaranteed (Fig. ), thus an appropriate balance between surgical field and oxygenation was achieved, and the blood and sputum from the upper lobe bronchial port can be sucked out. An automatic infusion of propofol and sufentanil combined with manual administration of rocuronium maintained the anesthesia for the operation. And a lung protective mechanical ventilation strategy was taken, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, tidal volume (Vt) 4–6 ml/kg, frequency 15–18/min. In the meantime, end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded to adjust ventilation. The lung recruitment, air leak test and sputum suction went well throughout the operation and the surgery was completed as planned. The patient recovered well after the surgery, so she was extubated in the operation room and sent to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for transition, where a routine oxygen supplementation was applied. Oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation were all strictly monitored and no adverse events were recorded in the PACU. She recovered better on the next day follow-up and was discharged from the hospital 6 days later. The pathological diagnosis was invasive adenocarcinoma.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He also had lower abdominal pain for two days which was the colicky type with no history of genital trauma. He had a history of inability to retract prepuce for 10 years with multiple episodes of burning micturition for the last one year. He had no fever spikes, reduced urine output, high colored urine, haematuria, and pyuria. He had complaints of obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms including straining, hesitancy, and post-void dribbling for the past one week. He had no significant history of any previous surgeries in the past. He denied a history of any sexual promiscuity in the past. On examination, he was conscious, oriented, and febrile with no signs of dehydration. His pulse rate was 104 per minute with a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. He had lower abdominal tenderness without a palpable bladder. Local examination revealed phimosis with a stony hard swelling over the glans penis under the prepuce with no visualization of the urethral meatus. Penile and scrotal edema were present with bilateral testes palpable and non-tender. He had enlarged tender bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The initial clinical impression was balanoposthitis with underlying carcinoma of the penis considering his age of presentation. Preputial calculus was also considered as a differential diagnosis in view of the hard consistency of the swelling. X-Ray of the pelvic region showed a radiopaque shadow in the glans region (Figure ). Ultrasound of the abdomen was done to rule out urolithiasis. Its findings included mucosal irregularity of bladder suggestive of cystitis with no associated renal calculi or hydroureteronephrosis. His creatinine and total white blood cell count were within normal limits and his urine culture was sterile. On the day of admission, cannulation with an infant feeding tube through the meatus was attempted. Finally, a dorsal slit was performed followed by catheterization with a Foley’s 12 Fr catheter. A single stone of size 4.5 cm x 3 cm (Figure ) was removed from the preputial space. He was started on intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole empirically in view of the clinical diagnosis of balanoposthitis. His wound was debrided and dressed regularly with Eusol. Penile and scrotal swelling gradually subsided with the local application of magnesium sulfate. Foley’s catheter was removed and the patient started passing urine freely from the urethral meatus.

The patient stated that he had consumed alcohol the evening prior to the presentation, and upon awakening the next morning, he had been unable to bear weight on lower extremities. He admitted to decreased sensation bilaterally, which extended from the foot to the ankle, more pronounced on the right side. Furthermore, the patient had a 7/10 dull pain sensation radiating from the lower back to bilateral lower extremities as well as generalized body aches. It was the progressive worsening of his symptoms that had prompted his hospital visit. He denied any other aggravating factors.
In the ED, the patient's vital signs were found to be remarkable for a temperature of 97.1 °F, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, heart rate of 124 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/27 mmHg. The patient denied any history of diabetes, kidney disease, or back pain. He had smoked half pack of cigarettes a day for ""a few years"", drank a pint of vodka three to four times a week, and used cocaine as well as marijuana daily for ""numerous"" years. He reported that he had used cocaine and marijuana a ""few"" days prior to the presentation. The patient's physical examination was significant for a decreased dull and sharp sensation of bilateral feet with intact sensation above the ankle as well as 1/5 muscle strength of bilateral legs and feet. The muscle strength was 4/5 in bilateral thighs as well as upper extremities.
An alcohol level screening was done in the ED, which revealed a level of less than 10 mg/dl. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, cannabinoids, and opiates. Lactic acid was elevated at 4.2. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity greater than 1.030 with large bilirubin, proteinuria, and hematuria. Urine microscopy revealed red blood cells of 4-6 high power field (HPF).
Initial complete blood count revealed a WBC of 20.9 K/UL with 83.2% absolute neutrophils, and hemoglobin and hematocrit level of 21.7 gm/dl and 64.1%, respectively, with a platelet count of 344 K. The patient’s complete metabolic panel was significant for elevated liver enzymes - aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 3,334 U/L (normal range: 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 850 U/L (normal range: 17-63 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 151 U/L (normal range: 38-126 U/L); there was renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 4.16 mg/dl (normal range: 0.7-1.2 mg/dl), urine nitrogen of 32 mg/dl (normal range: 8-20 mg/dl), and potassium of 7.4 mmol/l (normal range: 3.6-5.1 mmol/L) with high anion gap of 21. An arterial blood gas revealed PH of 7.23, PCO2 of 32 mmHg, HCO3 of 14.9 mmol/L, signifying metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation. CPK levels were markedly elevated at 100,809 U/L. Initial ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with peaked T wave as seen in Figure .
The patient received 2 grams of calcium gluconate infusion for cardiac membrane stabilization. He also received insulin and Kayexalate, which corrected his hyperkalemia. The patient was started on IV fluid (IVF) hydration with strict urine output monitoring. Initial MRI without contrast of spine was performed and was only remarkable for mild spondylosis without spondylolisthesis in the L4-L5 region. Neurology was consulted for a more thorough neurological examination, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.
In the ICU, the patient’s symptoms started to worsen and he reported progression of the numbness up to the knee in both lower limbs. He also complained of worsening pain and weakness in the right lower extremity. During the ICU stay, the right thigh became more swollen compared to the left. Urgent CT scan of the right lower extremity revealed right leg edema without focal tissue or osseous abnormality, as seen in Video .
Doppler ultrasound showed normal arterial flow and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient started experiencing new-onset right lower extremity weakness. Dorsal pedis and tibial pedis pulses were present bilaterally. At this juncture, there were concerns for acute compartment syndrome. The patient was placed on neurovascular checks every hour. Intracompartmental pressures were measured frequently, which remained low. Also, surgery was consulted for possible fasciotomy.
Despite aggressive IVF hydration, the patient’s CPK levels continued to rise. CPK levels peaked at 237,025U/L, even though his hemoconcentration had resolved. Creatinine levels continued to increase, and the patient became anuric and IVF hydration was discontinued. Vascular surgery and nephrology were consulted for emergent Uldall catheter placement and urgent hemodialysis, respectively.
Following repeat sessions of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function improved and CPK levels declined. His lower extremity weakness also started to improve. There was a significant improvement in his left lower extremity numbness. The right leg swelling resolved; however, there was only a mild improvement of motor and sensory loss. The patient continued to undergo physical therapy during his hospitalization. He was subsequently discharged to subacute rehabilitation. The patient was advised to continue with outpatient hemodialysis till full recovery of his renal function was achieved. He was also recommended to follow up with neurology as an outpatient.",What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?,"{'age': [32, 'years'], 'Alanine aminotransferase': [850.0, 'U/L'], 'Aspartate aminotransferase': [3334.0, 'U/L'], 'Platelet count': [344000.0, 'µL']}",10.638,10.106,11.17,"The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.

The patient's concentration of ALT is 850.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of platelets is 344000.0 count/µL. To convert 344000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 344000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 344000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 344000000000.0/(10^9) = 344.0 billion platelet counts per liter.

She reported that her symptoms started immediately post-procedure and that she continued to have multiple episodes of mostly clear vomit with streaks of blood. She also reported throat, chest, and epigastric pain and was unable to eat anything since the procedure due to her symptoms.
Her past medical history included hypertension, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, variceal hemorrhage, gall stones and Graves disease. She was on propranolol, lactulose, alprazolam and amlodipine at home. Social history was significant for heavy alcohol use for over 30 years, which she quit following an episode of variceal bleeding. She had no episodes of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding since her last EGD and banding. On physical examination, she was an ill-appearing female, had dry oral mucosa, tachycardic, had epigastric and RUQ tenderness with negative Murphy's sign, and no rebound or guarding. During the interview, she vomited small amounts of non-bloody white material several times.
On presentation, her laboratory tests were as follows: WBC 13.1, Hb/Hct 14/39.7, platelets 260; Na 152, K 3.6, Cl 112, CO2 22, BUN 30, Cr 0.87, glc 146; lipase 93, Alk Phos 113, AST/ALT 48/75, lactic acid 2.0 and drug screen was positive for propofol.
The patient was admitted for dehydration due to nausea and vomiting. She was started on IV fluids, anti-emetics, pain control and kept NPO (nothing by mouth). Her dyselectrolytemia improved following hydration and her diet was advanced on the following day. She could not tolerate oral intake and reported worsening dysphagia, nausea and vomiting. Over the course of next 2 days, the patient continued to have worsening dysphagia with no relief from anti-emetics. A barium swallow was administered which showed a complete obstruction of the distal esophagus (). The differential for obstruction was thought to be either from local edema from the banding procedure, impacted food or a hematoma from the procedure. An EGD was performed; the scope was advanced to 34 cm to the level of obstruction and it was noted to have a band with entrapped varix in the center of the lumen surrounded by fibrotic material closing off the rest of the lumen (). Several attempts were made with biopsy forceps to reopen the lumen that resulted in a small amount of bleeding and the scope was removed at this point. Conservative management of the patient continued, i.e., NPO with intravenous hydration and pain control. Her symptoms improved over the course of the next 3–4 days and she started tolerating diet advancement and was subsequently discharged.
She presented the next day with a recurrence of similar symptoms, i.e., dysphagia, abdominal pain and vomiting. A repeat barium swallow showed patency of the esophagus with a parallel channel that retained contrast much later than the initial swallow, suggestive of an esophageal tear with an intramural dissection of 6 cm to the level of gastro-esophageal junction ().
The patient was kept NPO with peripheral parenteral nutrition and close monitoring for possible esopheageal perforation. Over the course of the next several days, the diet was carefully advanced with inputs from gastroenterologist and surgical consultants. After 5 days, the patient reported much improvement in her symptoms and was able to tolerate a full diet for the first time.

The concentration of sodium is 152.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 152.0 mEq. To convert from 152.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 152.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 152.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 152.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 152.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 152.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 30.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 146.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 152.0 + (30.0 / 2.8) + (30.0 / 18) = 322.825 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 322.825 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 322.825 mOsm/kg."

To convert from 125.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 125.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 125.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 125.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 125.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 18.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 114.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 125.0 + (18.0 / 2.8) + (18.0 / 18) = 262.762 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 262.762 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 262.762 mOsm/kg."
3017,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-8041535-1,Extracted,"A 60-year-old Japanese woman with no medical history was admitted to the emergency department of another hospital with a chief complaint of severe left lateral pain. She had no family history of endocrine disease including pheochromocytoma. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a left 5.7 cm adrenal mass with a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage (), and the patient was transferred to our hospital for multidisciplinary treatment.
She was 149 cm tall and weighed 49 kg. On presentation, her vital signs and physical findings were as follows: body temperature of 37.3°C, pulse rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 193/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18/min, and Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. These findings strongly suggested that her pain was caused by a ruptured pheochromocytoma. Laboratory tests revealed that her white blood count was 28180/μL, hemoglobin was 11.2 g/dL, and hepatic enzymes were normal. However, her creatinine (Cre) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 1.03 mg/dL and 43 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, which indicated decreased renal function. After arriving at our hospital, her blood pressure suddenly dropped to 62/44 mmHg. Ongoing hemorrhage was suspected because of sudden hypotension. Under a presumptive diagnosis of active bleeding from a ruptured left adrenal tumor suspected of pheochromocytoma, we decided to perform TAE to prevent the further deterioration of hemodynamics. Angiography was performed using a right femoral approach and showed that the tumor blood flow was supplied from a branch of the left adrenal artery. Thereafter, TAE was selectively performed for the left inferior adrenal artery by using gelatin sponge particles and coiling. No further tumor vascularity was demonstrated by subsequent contrast injection. Her hemodynamics stabilized after TAE, and systolic blood pressure ranged from 150–170 mmHg. After admission, she was treated with intravenous nicardipine and oral doxazosin. Intravenous phentolamine was not administered to this patient because phentolamine was not available in our hospital.
On the second day of admission, hormonal assays were performed and showed markedly elevated levels of plasma metanephrine at 952 pg/mL (reference range <130 pg/mL), plasma normetanephrine at 3150 pg/mL (reference range <506 pg/mL), urinary metanephrine at 6.64 μg/mg Cr (reference range <0.2 μg/mg Cr), and urinary normetanephrine at 7.22 μg/mg Cr (reference range <0.3 μg/mg Cr). On the third day of admission, abdominal computed tomography was performed and showed a significant resolution of the retroperitoneal hematoma. She was discharged on day 11 after TAE without any symptoms. At discharge, the systolic blood pressure was improved to 130 mmHg or less by oral doxazosin 4 mg/day alone. On the day after discharge, an iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan was performed, and results showed only a significant left adrenal uptake.
She was followed up at an outpatient clinic, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that the tumor size had spontaneously and gradually decreased. The tumor sizes were 3.1, 2.8, and 1.3 cm one month, three months, and five months after discharge, respectively (). Tumor shrinkage prompted us to resect the tumor laparoscopically (). Six months after TAE, laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was successfully performed with proper preoperative treatment by 7 mg/day of doxazosin. Pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of an adrenal pheochromocytoma (). The gross appearance of the resected tumor was 13 mm × 12 mm × 11 mm in size and was yellow and tan in color. Pathological examination revealed coagulative necrosis in the tumor, and the cytoplasm of the tumor cells was immunohistochemically positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and S100. The Ki67 labeling index was <1%. A score of five was obtained from the grading system for adrenal pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (histological pattern; large and irregular cell nest, one point; cellularity, high, two points; vascular or capsular invasion; presence, one point; and catecholamine type and noradrenaline type, one point) []. She was graded as moderately differentiated.
Doxazosin was stopped after surgical resection, and her blood pressure was stable. Plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine levels decreased to 21 and 78 ng/L, respectively, at three months postoperatively. Urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine levels also showed a significant decrease. At the half-year follow-up, her postoperative course was uneventful without any recurrence of pheochromocytoma, and levels of plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine remained within normal ranges.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Heart Rate or Pulse': [106.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': False, 'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False}",1.5,1.5,1.5,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

There was a history of orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She had no associated cough but had a mild centrally located chest pain. There was a history of bilateral leg swelling which has been progressively worsening and associated with diminution in urine volume. She was diagnosed as hypertensive five years before presentation but had not been compliant with antihypertensive medications. There was no known family history of hypertension.
Examination showed a young woman in respiratory distress, pale, afebrile (temperature 36.8°C), bilateral pitting leg oedema up to the knee with no sacral oedema. Waist circumference was 78 cm, hip circumference 80 cm, and a body mass index (BMI) 23.8 kg/m2.
Her respiratory rate was 50 cycles/minute with reduced breath sounds in the left lower lung zones and bibasal fine crepitations. The pulse rate was 118 beats/minute, normal volume and regular. There was clinical evidence of arterial wall thickening. Blood pressure was 220/120 mmHg with a fourth heart sound and loud aortic component of the second heart sound. She also had grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy on fundoscopy and asterixis but no lateralizing signs.
An initial diagnosis of acute-on-chronic renal failure secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, precipitated by malignant hypertension, was made.
Results of investigations are shown as follows.Results of investigations done: E/U/C (predialysis). Creatinine: 900 μmol/L (53–115). Urea: 30 mmol/L (2.1–7.1). Na: 136 mmol/L (135–145). K: 4.0 mmol/L (3.2–5.0). Cl: 98 mmol/L (96–108). HCO3: 28 mmol/L (22–28). HBsAg, anti-HCV, and HIV: negative. Urinalysis showed ++ proteinuria, no haematuria. Renal ultrasound scan and renal artery Doppler: renal USS/Doppler-right kidney measured 8.63 × 4.59 × 5.07 cm. There was loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Doppler insonation of the renal artery showed a velocity of 73.9 cm/second and a resistive index of 0.9 suggesting renal intraparenchymal disease. The upper margin of the left kidney appeared to be intrathoracic and could not be well deciphered. The echotexture was hypoechoic with complete loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Doppler insonation of the left renal artery showed a velocity of 195 cm/min consistent with a stenotic artery. On the basis of the finding suggestive of left renal artery stenosis, the plan was to do a renal artery angiogram, but the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy precluded this investigation. Abdominal CT scan report: the scanogram showed a left intrathoracic well-marginated upper border mass obscuring the left hemidiaphragm medially and obscuring the cardiac apex. Contiguous slices showed the left kidney to be in an abnormal location in the left hemithorax sitting between the cardiac silhouette and spleen. The right kidney was in its normal location with major blood vessels appearing normal. The left kidney was slightly bigger than the right one, (see Figures , , and ). Captopril renogram. Right kidney: intact perfusion followed by almost uniform uptake of radiotracer. Left kidney: intact perfusion followed by nonuniform uptake of radiotracer. Its upper moiety is truncated out of field of view of the camera, therefore, making computation of differential renal function impossible.

He is an off-spring of non-consanguineous parents, born full-term normal delivery, with cephalic presentation, no history of hypoxia, birth weight 3.3 kg, no complications such as obvious hypotonia and feeding difficulties after birth (The birth length is not known). The child was breastfed till he turned 2 years old, and while he started walking at 2 years old, he commenced talking later than his peers. The child also showed slow reaction since childhood, poor academic performance, mild intellectual disability and social fear. Movement disorder was noted in July 2020, needing a visual reference when he walks, otherwise he walked unsteadily. The patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 105 kg, and his BMI was, therefore, 43.70 kg/m2. According to the percentile curve of height and weight of boys aged 2 to 18 years old obtained from the physical development survey of 9 provinces and cities in China in 2005, the patient's height is less than 3% of the same age and sex in the same region, and his weight is more than 97%. Further, he had thick and black hair with a thick posterior hairline to the neck, thick eyebrows, wide eye-distance, collapsed nose, some beard scattered around the mouth, no Adam's apple, changed voice, armpit hair, and smaller hands and feet when compared to his peers. There was no breast development on either side. He had a thick vulva and pubic hair and pigmentation in the penis and scrotum, but there had been no obvious enlargement of his penis since he turned 9 years old, no morning erection and no spermatorrhea. The penis was found to be about 4 cm long in the non-erected state, and the left testicle's volume was found to be about 1 mL. The right testis was not palpable.
Based on the patient's medical history, imaging examination and molecular genetic testing results, the diagnosis was SYS. Patient was advised to reduce weight, control blood lipids, blood glucose through appropriate strengthening of exercise and diet control in the future. At the same time, the family members were advised to provide mental training to the patients to strengthen their contact and communication with the outside world and improve the autistic symptoms of the patient. Because of the patient's bilateral cryptorchidism, it is recommended that the patient should be treated with bilateral cryptorchidism reduction fixation in the department of urology. After a follow-up of the patient for 2 months, the patient is still walking unsteadily and requires an auxiliary reference material to walk normally. There is no significant change in height compared to before, and the weight has dropped by about 2 kg in the past 2 months. The rest of the physical examination did not show significant changes. The symptoms of autism have improved slightly.

She had experienced an episode of rejection 2 years after her liver transplant manifested by an elevation in liver enzymes up to 3 times the upper limit of normal and a total bilirubin increase. Fortunately, abnormal liver function tests completely responded to the typical pulse regimen of methylprednisolone. After that, she underwent an inevitable splenectomy because of severe pancytopenia, multiple tortuous venous collaterals and multiple hypodense parenchymal infarcts in the spleen attributed to huge splenomegaly and hypersplenism. At the time of admission, physical examination revealed her vital signs to be body temperature: 39oC, heart rate: 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate: 21 times per minute, and blood pressure: 120/75 mmHg.

Initially, the patient was asked to discontinue cellcept because of an increased risk of developing severe sepsis in such circumstances. Hydration and empiric antibiotic therapy were started. Nephrology consult was requested because of a rise in serum BUN and creatinine level probably due to prerenal azotemia. Ultrasonography revealed a decrease in kidney size and an increase in corticomedullary differentiation, indicating an episode of acute kidney injury in addition to a preexisting chronic kidney disease. Moreover, ultrasonography findings revealed a normal orthotopic liver in size and contour. Normal intra and extra biliary ducts were detected.

She had no abnormalities in her pediatric medical history, but from the age 18, she had slowly begun experiencing headaches in her left temporal lobe, nausea, and vomiting. In June of that year, she experienced generalized convulsions and aphasia. In a brain MRI and MRA, an infarction in the posterior divisions of the left mesencephalic arteries was found. Also, in a blood test, an increase in lactic acid was discovered (7.54 mM/L [normal level: 0.5-2.254 mM/L]). The patient was suspected to have MELAS syndrome. She was diagnosed with MELAS after testing (adenosine-to-guanine transition at t-RNA nucleotide 3243 in PCR sequencing). After she turned 21, she was diagnosed with Type I DM. The patient had to orally ingest 200 mg of carbamazepine and 100 mg of aspirin per day and subcutaneously inject 30 units of insulin in the morning and 20 units in the evening. She had no history of total anesthesia.
In a physical examination before the anesthesia, the patient was able to read but had auditory aphasia such that she could not understand spoken words. In the physical examination, there were no signs of hypotonia or amyotrophy of the limbs. The laboratory results showed hyponatremia (126 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (257 mg/dl), and light metabolic acidosis (pH 7.346, PaCO2 36.3 mmHg, HCO3 20.1 mM/L, BE -5.3 mM/L). There were no abnormal findings in the chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. One year prior to her admission to the hospital, she had an ECG that revealed a cardiac index of 67% and no abnormal findings. For sugar control, 4 units of shortacting insulin were injected, and 0.9% normal saline was administered to control hyponatremia. No other pre-operative measures were performed.
After the patient was taken to the operating room, we attached ECG standard leads II, noninvasive monitors for blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, capnogram, and bispectral index (BIS), and a nerve stimulator to the patient using the Multi Channel Anesthesia Monitor S/5™ (Datex-Ohmeda, USA). Preliminary vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 115/65 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats/min, oxygen saturation rate 97%, and the ECG results appeared normal. The patient underwent 3 minutes of denitrogenation with 100% oxygen through a face mask. Afterwards, we administered lidocaine (40 mg) with the Master TCI (Fresenius Vial S.A., France); we then injected 2% propofol (Fresofol®, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) and remifentanil (Ultiva™, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) at target concentrations of 4 µg/ml (Marsh-model) and 5 ng/ml (Minto-model), respectively. After roughly 90 seconds had passed, we checked lid reflexes and found that the patient had lost consciousness. We administered atracurium (0.5 mg/kg), the BIS was 50, and we saw that there was no response to TOF stimulation with the nerve stimulator placed on the ulnar nerve. Endotracheal intubation was then performed without complications. We started mechanical respiration with air (1.5 L/min), oxygen (1.5 L/min), respiratory volume of 450 ml, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. To control ventilation, the capnogram was kept at 35-40 mmHg. We used spirometry to measure the respiratory volume and pulmonary compliance. We started invasive blood pressure monitoring through the radial artery and measured the esophageal temperature with a body temperature monitor. During the operation, we used a forced-air warming blanket (Bair Hugger™, Austine Medical, USA) to stabilize the patient's body temperature. For fluid maintenance, we administered 0.9% normal saline at 200 ml per hour. During the operation, the patient's vitals were kept stable with blood pressure at 120-140/60-80 mmHg, heart rate 80-100 beats/min, oxygen saturation 100%, body temperature 37.0-37.4℃, and BIS 40-60. Thirty minutes after inducing anesthesia, the arterial blood gas study showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 32 mmHg, PaO2 299 mmHg, HCO3 23.3 mM/L, BE -2.1 mM/L; her electrolytes were Na+ 125 mEq/L, K+ 3.8 mEq/L, Cl- 88 mEq/L; and her blood sugar was 176 mg/dl. Twenty minutes prior to the end of the operation, we administered ondansetron (4 mg) to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting. After suturing the peritoneum, we stopped injecting remifentanil, kept the level of propofol in the target effect site at 2 µg/ml, and restored spontaneous breathing. After the operation was over, we stopped injecting propofol and stabilized spontaneous breathing at 300 ml per breath on the spirometer. On the nerve stimulator, the TOF rate was kept at 0.95. To reverse the muscle relaxant effects, we administered glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) and pyridostigmine (15 mg). Afterwards, the patient responded to voice commands and opened her eyes. With stabilized spontaneous breathing, she was extubated. The operation lasted around 1 hour, and during the operation, 350 ml of 0.9% normal saline were used. We then moved the patient to the recovery room and kept her under observation with blood pressure, electrogram, and oxygen saturation monitors. In the recovery room, we gave her oxygen at 5 L/min through the facial mask. The arterial blood gas study showed pH 7.32, PaCO2 43 mmHg, PaO2 219 mmHg, HCO3 21.2 mM/L, and BE -3.6 mM/L; her electrolyte levels were Na+ 128 mEq/L, K+ 4.1 mEq/L, and Cl- 90 mEq/L; and her blood sugar level was 120 mg/dl. We then moved the patient to the ward where we performed a lactic acid test, which measured 3.6 mM/L.

The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult female's the total body water percentage value is 0.50.
The patient's weight is 48.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 128.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 128.0 mEq. To convert from 128.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 128.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 128.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 128.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 128.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 128.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 48.0 * (128.0/140 - 1) = -2.06 L.

In laboratory test, the white blood cell count was 14,900/mm3, hemoglobin was 10 g/dL, and platelet count was 199,000/mm3. The result of coagulation test was PT 1.13 (INR) and aPTT 24.4 sec. The result of blood chemistry was total protein 5.9 g/dL, albumin 3.5 g/dL, AST 27 IU/L, ALT 11 IU/L, ALP 118 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, BUN 21.2 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, Na 142 mEq/L, K 3.8 mEq/L, Cl 106 mmol/L, CRP 0.08 mg/dL, and blood sugar 145 mg/dL.
Abdominal computed tomography scan showed about 8 × 3 cm nonenhancing mass in the stomach antrum and lower body. The Hounsfield unit of mass was 50∼60 units (). It suggested submucosal hematoma in stomach.
Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed. A pool of blood was on the greater curvature side of body in the stomach. Greater than 5 cm-sized mass was noted on the anterior wall of body and antrum. The mass was round, dark brownish. But surrounding mucosa was normal. The overlying mucosa of mass was ruptured. Dark red hematoma was noted inside the mass (). Removal of hematoma and hemostasis could not be performed owing to noncooperation of the patient.
She was diagnosed with ruptured intramural hematoma. We decided to treat conservatively because further bleeding was not occurred. We treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitor and fluids. In addition, we made her fasting for one week.
On hospital day 8, the gastric intramural hematoma has disappeared in the follow-up abdominal CT scan (). On follow-up EGD, the gastric intramural hematoma on anterior wall of low body and proximal antrum has disappeared. EGD showed active ulcer on the same site (). At that time, EGD showed a whitish worm resembling a short thread. The worm moved at the gastroesophageal junction. The worm was removed out of the body by using a biopsy forcep. The worm was a 2 cm-sized nematode. It was confirmed as anisakis (Figures –).
Then, the meal was served. Further bleeding was not occurred. The patient was recovered and discharged without other complications.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [21.2, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [145.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [142.0, 'mEq/L']}",299.627,284.646,314.608,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mEq. To convert from 142.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 142.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 142.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 142.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 142.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 21.2 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 145.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 142.0 + (21.2 / 2.8) + (21.2 / 18) = 299.627 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 299.627 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 299.627 mOsm/kg."

3072,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-8364437-1,Extracted,"A 74-year-old female patient came in for a follow-up with an extensive past medical and surgical history. During the visit, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 133/83 mmHg; heart rate, 88 beats/min; temperature, 97.5°F; respiratory rate, 16/min; and body mass index, 27.16. Her medications were the following: vitamin D, potassium, magnesium, aspirin 81 mg/day (calcium supplement), glucosamine capsule, and prednisone 20 mg as needed.
Past medical history: The patient has a past medical history of skin cancer, endometrial cancer, and Schneiderian papilloma of the right mastoid.
Past surgical history: The patient had undergone a bilateral hip replacement, hysterectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, breast lump resection, tubal ligation, resection of Schneiderian papilloma (June 2018), and excision of skin cancer from the right leg (December 2019).
In 2014, the patient presented with right-sided hearing loss. In 2017, her right tympanic membrane was perforated, with blood and abnormal tissue protruding from the eustachian tube orifice. Right ear tympanostomy tubes were placed, which helped. The tube eventually fell out, and the tympanic membrane healed. She had a recurrence of middle ear effusion, for which a computed tomography (CT) scan of the right temporal area was performed. The CT images with and without contrast showed complete opacification of the right middle ear cavity and mastoid air cells.
Because of the opacification of the middle ear and the mastoid air cells, an audiogram was recommended to test the extent of hearing loss. The results demonstrated mild sloping profound sensorineural hearing loss of the right ear with a conductive component at 2 kHz and mild sloping profound sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear. The pure tone averages were 60 dB in the right ear and 28 dB in the left ear. The word recognition scores were 36% on the right and 92% on the left. The fiber-optic examination revealed blood draining from the right eustachian tube orifice. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed extensive fluid throughout the mastoid air cells and the middle ear with some relative enhancement.
She underwent right trans-temporal craniotomy and partial resection of the mass in January 2018. Histopathology was performed on the excised mass, which was reported as an ELST. In May 2018, a follow-up MRI revealed the recurrence of the lesion, and on physical examination, the lesion was protruding through the eardrum associated with otorrhea. In June 2018, a re-resection of the lesion was done, and this time, the eardrum, malleus, incus, and external canal bones were removed. There was a portion along the petrous bone and carotid artery where the tumor could not be removed, and the tumor extended from the middle fossa dura to the sigmoid sinus.
The patient then underwent radiation therapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions). In November 2019, the patient developed right facial palsy, which was treated with two weeks of prednisone without resolution. A follow-up MRI showed a new 5-mm nodule in the right nasopharynx. There was no radiographic reoccurrence of the tumor in the right temporal bone/fossa, and there was no evidence of facial nerve involvement.
In January 2020, the patient underwent a right-sided nasopharyngeal eustachian tube biopsy. The biopsy specimen was sent and processed in the pathology department, and the report showed a low-grade papillary neoplasm consistent with an ELST origin. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up MRI and CT in the next six months. The details about how the biopsy specimen was processed and the histopathological diagnostic features of ELST are discussed in the Methods and Materials sections below.
Methods and materials
The biopsy specimen was processed by fixing in formalin and embedding in paraffin before sectioning and fixing on glass slides. After the slides were processed and ready, they were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In addition to H&E, some selected slides were also stained with periodic acid Schiff.
An immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was performed using the EnVision method. The process of immunostaining implies the selective recognition of antigens (proteins) in the tissue sections of cells by utilizing the fundamental rationale of antibody binding particularly to the antigens in the biological tissue. The antibodies that were used for IHC in this case of ELST were cytokeratin 7 (CK-7), pan-keratin, cytokeratin 20 (CK-20), cytokeratin 19 (CK-19), vimentin, glial fibrillary acid protein (GAF), thyroglobulin, and Ki-67. The slides were boiled under high pressure with citrate buffer (0.01 mole/L, pH 6.0) for the purpose of antigen retrieval. The proper positive and negative controls were also performed.
Histopathology
Low Power
Morphologically, at low power, the specimen showed mostly papillary and focally glandular architecture. The neoplastic proliferation of the tumor cells comprised columnar and focally cuboidal cells with round to oval nuclei that show mild to moderate pleomorphism with abundant extracytoplasmic mucin (Figures , ). As mentioned above, the tumor cells were generally columnar or cuboidal and cohesive, often with distinct cell boundaries. Above the basement membrane and underneath the luminal cells was a layer of conspicuous myoepithelial cells. The epithelial cells have a clear-pale cytoplasm, luminal, central, and uniform nuclei. In the case of infected and old healing lesions, inflammatory infiltrates were often present next to neoplastic cells along with granulation tissue.
High Power
On higher magnification, a single layer of columnar to cuboidal cells lined the papillary and glandular structures. Moderate to mild pleomorphism, rare mitotic activity, and necrosis were not observed. On the other hand, multiple acinar configurations with infiltrative growth patterns and desmoplastic responses were seen (Figure ). Unconventional microscopic features that were not observed in our case of ELST but may be present in others include intermittent thyroid-like hypercellular regions with cystic glandular spaces filled with colloid substances, areas of hemorrhage, and necrosis with cholesterol clefts, mitotic figures, and structures that appear similar to choroid plexuses papillomas.
Immunochemistry
As described in the Methods and Materials sections, an IHC study was performed. CK-20, which highlights papillary growth, was negative, whereas CK-7 immunostaining was positive as evident in Figures , .
Diagnostic modalities for an ELST
Radiography
In this case of ELST, both CT and MRI were used as the imaging diagnostic tools. The CT scan and MRI results showed opacifications in the middle ear and the mastoid air cells in 2018, during the initial presentation of the patient. After partial resection of the lesion, the patient developed a nasopharyngeal mass along with middle ear effusion, which was diagnosed through a CT scan and MRI in January 2020.
The CT scan and MRI techniques are widely used to diagnose ELST []. The CT scan images usually show a lytic temporal bone mass that typically extends into the posterior cranial cavity, which may present as a cerebellopontine angle tumor. In most cases, the tumor center rests at or near the temporal bone at the posterior medial surface [,].
Angiography and Audiogram
Apart from the imaging modalities, the most sophisticated procedure to diagnose an ELST in clinical practice is angiography. Compared to an angiography, an audiogram is a noninvasive test that was performed in this case of ELST. The audiogram showed that the patient had significant hearing loss in the right ear and moderate hearing loss in the left ear because of an invading ELST. A fiber-optic examination was also performed, which showed blood draining into the eustachian tube.
Angiography was not performed on this patient. However, according to previous angiography results in the literature, the tumor can have a dual blood supply from intra- and extra-cranial sources, making it extremely vascularized. A jugulotympanic paraganglioma is another entity that can mimic ELST because both of these tumors are highly vascularized and can carry potential bleeding risks [].
Differential Diagnosis of ELST
Intrinsic temporal bone neoplasms are included in the differential diagnosis for ELSTs, with paragangliomas being the most common. Meanwhile, metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and choroid plexus papilloma are histologically similar to ELSTs. The ELSTs are papillary cystic structures lined with a simple cuboidal or columnar epithelium and are heavily vascularized. Clear cells, as well as siderophages and cholesterol clefts, are visible (vacuolated cells). Nuclear pleomorphism is minimal, and mitoses are uncommon [,].
Staging
There are no universally accepted staging recommendations. Bambakidis et al. suggested the system described in Table [].
Schipper et al. defined type A tumors as those with no temporal bone destruction or dura invasion, type B as those with signs of osseous labyrinth infiltration and sensorineural hearing loss, and type C as those that have invaded the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb [,].
The patient in this case underwent resection for a tumor that extended into the sigmoidal sinus and middle cranial fossa. If we follow the proposed staging system, then it is obvious that the tumor was an aggressive one, and the patient presented as stage III at the time of treatment.
Treatment
Complete resection with negative margins is the treatment of choice for ELST, but in advanced cases, this may not be possible. As the patient presented as ELST stage III, the only universally accepted treatment of choice is complete resection of the neoplastic tissue, which is recommended. Because of the complexity and advanced stage of the disease, the tumor was only partially resected. Under general anesthesia, she underwent a trans-temporal craniotomy and a partial resection of the lesion, along with resection of the eardrum, malleus, incus, and external canal bones. There were portions along the petrous bone, carotid artery, middle cranial fossa, and sigmoid sinus where the tumor could not be removed.
After the surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered with subsequent follow-ups. In January 2020, her follow-up MRI results showed a 5-cm lesion in the nasopharynx that was biopsied and confirmed as a reoccurrence of the ELST. The relapse of the ELST after resection confirms the aggressive nature and high recurrence rate of this condition.
Because the tumor relapsed, follow-up CT scans and MRIs were scheduled every six months, and close monitoring was recommended. From the patient's past medical and surgical history, she developed the ELST after the resection of the Schneiderian papilloma. Schneiderian papillomas are mostly benign, non-aggressive neoplasms that arise from the sinonasal mucosa. The development of ELST from a Schneiderian papilloma is quite rare. The pathological variants, classification, differentials diagnoses, etiological factors, clinical features, and treatment modalities of ELST and Schneiderian papillomas are elaborated in detail in the Discussion section.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [88.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Hemoptysis': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': True, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': False}",1,1,1,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

2013,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-5942209-2,Extracted,"A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of progressively worsening dyspnea. The dyspnea was worse with exertion or laying down flat. She also complained of a productive cough, fatigue, and weight loss. She denied any sick contacts or recent travel. The patient has not been seen by a primary care physician for many years. She had 25 pack-years smoking history. She also endorsed occasional marijuana and cocaine use. Family history was notable for lung cancer in her mother.
Physical examination in the emergency room revealed a cachectic female in moderate respiratory distress who was alert and oriented. She was afebrile with a pulse of 106 beats per min, blood pressure of 119/76 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2 L oxygen via nasal cannula. No jugular venous distension was noted. S1 and S2 heart sounds were distant with no audible murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds were severely decreased in the right mid and lower fields but otherwise normal in the other fields. No edema, clubbing, or cyanosis was observed in the extremities.
Laboratory work up revealed leukocytosis (WBC 15.8 K/uL), hyponatremia 128 mmol/L, hypochloremia 92 mmol/L, and lactic acidosis 2.94 mEq/L. B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin were within normal limits. Arterial blood gas on 2 L oxygen revealed a pH of 7.45, a partial carbon dioxide pressure of 30 mm Hg, a partial oxygen pressure of 92 mm Hg, and bicarbonate of 23.1 mEq/L. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia (). Chest radiograph revealed a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level in the right upper lobe and an enlarged cardiac silhouette (). CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast was performed, and it revealed a right upper lobe necrotic mass, pericardial effusion, and right pleural effusion along with right middle lobe medial segment collapse (). Extensive mediastinal adenopathy and bilateral adrenal masses were also noted. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of > 70% with right ventricular and right atrial diastolic collapse ( a-b).
The patient underwent emergent pericardiocentesis and placement of pigtail catheter to evacuate pericardial and pleural fluid, respectively, for therapeutic relief and fluid analysis. Approximately 850 mL of serosanguineous fluid was removed from the pericardial cavity. Later on, a pericardial window was placed by cardiothoracic surgery. Cytology studies indicated primary lung adenocarcinoma with positivity for Napsin-A and TTF-1. Further analysis revealed high expression of PD-L1 and positive BRAF c.1780G>A (p.D594N) mutation. Blood cultures and acid-fast bacilli smear performed on admission were negative for any acute infection. The patient’s shortness of breath improved during the hospital stay, and her electrolyte abnormalities were corrected.

6078,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-4528876-1,Extracted,"A 78-year-old man presented with 1-day history of nausea and vomiting. His symptoms started suddenly the night prior to presentation. The nausea was constant, to the point where he could no longer tolerate oral intake. Vomiting occurred 5 to 6 times throughout the evening, but there were no further episodes as of the morning of presentation. He endorsed very minimal epigastric burning, which he described as a “gas pain,” but he had no other abdominal symptoms. His bowel movements were normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days prior; during that hospitalization, he had symptomatic bradycardia felt to be secondary to his β-blocker. His dosage was reduced, his bradycardia improved, and he was discharged home. Since discharge, he noted persistent exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema.
The past medical history was remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction of approximately 40%) with stage III diastolic dysfunction, and chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 2.2). He smoked 4 cigarettes daily for 25 years, but not the last 20 years. His medications included aspirin, simvastatin, furosemide, metoprolol tartrate, and glipizide.
On examination, his blood pressure was 136/71 mmHg, heart rate 77 bpm, respiratory rate 16, temperature 36.1°C, oxygen saturation 100% (room air), weight 82 kg, and no orthostasis. In general, he was not in acute distress. There were no skin lesions. Mucous membranes were moist. Lung fields were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart was regular without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He had jugular venous distention 4 cm above the sternal angle. His abdomen was benign. He had no tenderness over his liver and no hepatomegaly was present. He had minimal bilateral lower extremity edema.
The patient’s white blood cell count was 15 200/mm3. The hemoglobin was 13 g/dL, and the platelet count was 97 000/mm3.

His brain-natriuretic peptide was 1040 pg/mL (normal = <100 pg/mL), and troponin was 0.50 ng/mL (normal = <0.09 mg/mL). His lipase was 49.0 IU/L (normal = 10-50 IU/L).
An abdominal ultrasound revealed increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma, patent hepatic vasculature, and no dilated intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts. The acetaminophen level was zero and the urine drug screen negative. Hepatitis A to C serologies were negative, and antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, F-actin antibody, and liver-kidney microsome-1 antibody titers were all normal. Further review of his past records indicated that his liver tests were AST 47 IU/L and ALT 53 IU/L during his hospitalization 10 days ago.
The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG; ) revealed multiple conduction defects including a right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and a first-degree atrioventricular block. He also had inferior Q waves and T wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and V3. These findings along with the conduction defects were all seen on previous ECGs. Review of prior records indicated that he had a left heart catheterization about 18 months prior to this admission. At that time was found to have nonobstructive coronary disease.
His most recent echocardiogram (), which was performed 2 weeks prior to this admission, showed a reduced ejection fraction (40%), biatrial enlargement (, RA and LA), and biventricular hypertrophy (, VS and PW; , arrows). There was also a granular or “speckled” appearance of the myocardium (, asterisk). The estimated peak right ventricular systolic pressure was 34 mm Hg based on an estimated right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, without primary valvular abnormalities. Mitral valve inflow Doppler and mitral annulus tissue Doppler () were consistent with severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The E/e ratio was >15, consistent with an elevated left ventricular filling pressure. There was hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior and septal walls.
The patient was monitored overnight and his symptoms resolved without intervention. His blood pressure remained within normal limits and he had normal urine output. The aminotransferases declined dramatically, to a level of 1070 IU/L within 48 hours. He was discharged home in baseline condition. One month later, he was seen in cardiology clinic during which time he had further evaluation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; ).

She had not yet experienced menarche and she denied sexual activity. The patient had seen her pediatrician at symptom onset, and it was documented that the patient had Tanner Stage IV development but no menstruation. No genitourinary exam had been performed. At that visit, the patient was diagnosed with constipation and counseled on diet changes. Two weeks later, the patient returned to her pediatrician for the same symptoms, and an outpatient transabdominal US was ordered to evaluate her pelvic organs. Her pain worsened prior to her scheduled US, so she presented to the ED.

The woman’s antenatal care was uneventful. She had no significant medical, surgical or family history and no history suggestive of thromboembolism. She had never used oral contraceptives or any other hormonal therapy.
Upon arrival, she had a temperature of 36.8 °C, pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 119/71 mmHg. A physical examination on admission showed a gravid uterus just below the xiphoid process. No abdominal tenderness or rebound tenderness were appreciated. The bowel sounds were normal and there were no signs suggestive of peritonitis. A hematologic examination revealed a leukocyte count of 13.1 × 109/L (normal range 4.0 × 109/L - 10.0 × 109/L) with neutrophils accounting for 73.9% (normal range 50–70%), hemoglobin level of 98.6 g/L (normal range 100 g/L - 150 g/L), hematocrit of 0.317 (normal range 0.37–0.43), and platelet count of 187 × 109/L (normal range 100 × 109/L - 300 × 109/L).

Physical examination demonstrated right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound tenderness and a distended abdomen and weak bowel sounds. Hematologic testing revealed leukocytosis with a left shift (leucocyte count of 26.9 × 109/L and neutrophils accounting for 91%) and hemoconcentration (hematocrit of 0.439). Serum amylase was normal. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed dilation and effusion of the right intestinal canals, thickening of the intestinal wall and a small amount of ascites. Abdominal plain radiography was performed and showed no dilated bowel loops and no features of obstruction or pneumoperitoneum. Obstetric ultrasound revealed demise of the fetus.
Acute appendicitis with perforation was suspected and an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed immediately. On exploration, approximately 1500 mL of serosanguineous peritoneal fluid was found in the abdomen. The entire ileum, part of the jejunum and part of the ascending colon were gangrenous, and thromboembolism in the corresponding mesenteric veins was noted. The necrotic intestine, measuring approximately 180 cm, was resected and an end-to-end jejunum-colon anastomosis was performed. Since there was no evidence of pending spontaneous labor and delivery and to avoid the release of fetally-derived necrotic materials that could complicate the clinical scenario via pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory effects, a cesarean section was performed and the fetus and placenta were removed. The patient’s hematological values during the operation showed a white cell count of 14.58 × 109/L, neutrophils accounting for 91%, hemoglobin of 73 g/L, a hematocrit of 0.236 and a platelet count of 135 × 109/L. The pathologic examination revealed extensive mucosal denudation, edema, hemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration in the submucosa and muscularis propria of the bowel (Fig. a), and widespread thrombosis in mesenteric venous lumens (Fig. b).
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit after surgery. Total parenteral nutrition, intravenous antibiotics and full anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin were initiated postoperatively and continued until discharge. Thrombolytic therapy was withheld due to bleeding risk. The patient had a reasonably uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 36. Four years later, the patient was again pregnant and underwent thrombophilia testing (antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and coagulation parameters) at 30 weeks of gestation. At that time, antithrombin III activity was 64% (normal range 80–120%). Her antithrombin III activity returned to normal (96%) 4 weeks later. She delivered a healthy baby through a cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation without thromboembolic event and without thromboprophylaxis. She has been recurrence-free for 10 years without anticoagulant therapy.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [119.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [71.0, 'mm hg']}",87.0,82.65,91.35,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

His past medical history was uneventful. He denied alcohol intake, drug use, and transfusions. At admission, physical examination revealed a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36°C. The patient was icteric and showed central cyanosis. His abdomen was distended, and bowel sounds were hypoactive, with generalized tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Liver and spleen were not palpable. Blood count showed hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 184 × 109, and a white cell count of 19.2 × 109, with predominance of neutrophils (84.9%). Coagulation screening tests showed a prothrombin time of 30.5 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time of 37.1 seconds, and international normalized ratio of 2.77. Biochemical analysis showed a blood glucose of 69 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 2.45 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen test 81.6, sodium 127 mmol/L, potassium 5.19 mmol/L, chloride 89 mmol/L, calcium 4.25 mmol/L, and phosphorus 3.8 mmol/L.

Total protein was 6.44 mg/dL, serum albumin 3.24 mg/dL, serum alanine aminotransferase 573 U/L, serum aspartate aminotransferase 1,256 U/L, serum alkaline phosphatase value 456 U/L, and serum lactic dehydrogenase 6,744 U/L, and arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.29 and lactate 8.2 mmol/L. The patient initially received crystalloids, followed by packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed mild hepatomegaly, perihepatic and flank fluid, and multiple hypodense liver lesions suggestive of intrahepatic metastases or multifocal HCC (Fig. ). Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was unavailable at the time of presentation. At emergency laparotomy, 2,800 mL of blood in the abdominal cavity were discovered; two actively bleeding liver tumors in segments III and VI, and multiple small nonbleeding tumors were observed (Fig. ). The liver did not show a cirrhotic aspect, and biopsy was taken. Suture plication and surgical perihepatic packing were performed. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, under mechanical ventilatory support, with hemodynamic instability and coagulopathy. Despite the proper management, the patient had a fatal outcome 48 h after the surgical procedure.

Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.","{'Albumin': [3.24, 'g/dL'], 'Calcium': [4.25, 'mmol/L']}",16.608,15.778,17.438,"To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL).
The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of Albmumin is 3.24 g/dL. 
The concentration of Calcium is 4.25 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 4.25 mmol. To convert 4.25 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.25 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.16 g Calcium. To convert 0.16 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.16 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 160.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 160.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 16.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 4.25 mmol Calcium/L converts to 16.0 mg Calcium/dL. 
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.24 g/dL)) + 16.0 mg/dL = 16.608 mg/dL.
The patient's corrected calcium concentration 16.608 mg/dL."

He was under followup for type II diabetes mellitus for the last 6 years and prostate cancer for the last 3 years. Maximal androgen deprivation therapy (GnRh analogue and nonsteroidal antiandrogen) was initiated 3 years ago, but the patient did not receive the treatment in a regular way. He had had 2 sessions of hemodialysis previously in emergency settings in another center. Blood tests at the time of first inspection were serum urea: 135 mg/dL, creatinine: 6.2 mg/dL, and prostate specific antigen: >153 ng/dL. Evaluation of the urinary tract revealed a maximal urinary flow rate of 6 mL/s, an international prostate symptom score (IPSS) of 29, and grade III dilation of bilateral kidneys and ureters on the sonogram. Invasion of the trigone and left ureteral orifice was observed, and right unit was double-j stented during cystoscopy. Diversion of the left unit with a percutanous nephrostomy was recommended, but was refused by the patient. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) was performed after serum creatinine was stabilized at a level of approximately 3 mg/dL 1 month after stenting of the right collecting system. Patient was discharged with a serum creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL and with conservative recommendations like increased oral hydration and low-protein diet. The patient was meticulously followed after the TUR-P with monthly routine blood biochemistry and PSA measurements and urinary ultrasound. Four months later, the patient applied with a sudden onset tachycardia. Laboratory analysis revealed serum hemoglobin, total calcium, ionized calcium, urea, creatinine, potassium, and glucose levels of 8.7 g/dL, 8.2 mg/dL, 4.7 mg/dL, 87 mg/dL, 3.61 mg/dL, 7.2 mmol/L, and 190 mg/dL, respectively. Coagulation panel and urine analysis were normal. There were wide QT interval and upright T waves in the Electocardiogram (ECG). Nephrologist suggested infusion of Ca and initiation of hemodialysis by these findings. The baseline and predialysis blood pressures of the patients were 147/85 mmHg and 150/90 mmHg, respectively.
A dialysis duration of 2.5 hours was scheduled in order to achieve the target uro-reduction rate of 30%. 1.2 m2 synthetic biocompatible membrane (Fresenius F6 polisulfone low flux fully synthetic biocompatible membrane) was employed. Dialysate bicarbonate value was set to 30 mEq/L. Heparin was not used as this was the first hemodialysis of the patient.
During dialysis, acute bilateral loss of vision developed in the patient and therefore the intervention was terminated. The highest and lowest systolic/diastolic blood pressures recorded during hemodialysis were 90/60 and 80/50 mmHg, respectively.
Ophthalmological inspection revealed that patient's vision was at the hand-motion level, the light reflexes were normal, there was no afferent pupillar defect, bilateral posterior segments, and bilateral intraocular pressures were normal. Findings suggested a central pathology, and the CT scan performed afterwards revealed large hypodense infarct areas in the bilateral occipital and parasagittal posterior region of right parietal lobes (Figures and ). Bilateral carotid artery doppler and echocardiography for differential diagnosis of thromboembolism were normal.
Patient was conscious, cooperating, and well oriented, and all deep tendon reflexes were found to be hyperactive in the neurological evaluation. Also a few days later right hemiparesis appeared in the patient. Therefore patient was accepted in the intensive care unit of the neurology department and received two times of 0,6 cc clexane and three times 10 mg dexametasone a day. Thus our purpose was to protect the ischemic penumbra with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effect.
Despite the recovery of hemiparesis, loss of vision continued during followup of the patient. Patient's loss of vision continued and did not recover throughout the followup.","Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [65, 'years'], 'creatinine': [3.61, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",17.047,16.195,17.899,"The patient is 65 years old.

The patient was found to have clitoromegaly on physical examination and was referred to our service for diagnosis and definitive treatment. The parents reported that their son exhibited masculine behaviors and personality traits throughout his life.
On physical examination, the vital signs were observed as follows: blood pressure, 100/70 mmHg; heart rate, 72 bpm; respiratory rate, 18 bpm; and body temperature at axillary level, 36.8 °C. Anthropometry revealed the following: bodyweight, 30 kg (60.57th percentile); height, 128 cm (18.50th percentile); the relationship between height and age, 40th percentile; and body mass index, 18.75 kg/cm2 (87.01th percentile). Preferential examination revealed the following: absence of pubic hair, no hyperpigmentation of the external genitalia, glans width of 3 mm, phallus length of 5 mm (clitoral index > 10 mm), presence of urethral meatus in the perineal area, and presence of palpable testicles at the level of the inguinal canal. The rest of the physical examination did not show significant alterations. Among the blood tests initially requested (Table ), the outstanding findings were the normal value of anti-Müllerian hormone and total testosterone, as well as the 46 XY karyotype, and the presence of the SRY gene. In addition, the LH value indicated that the patient was presumably at a puberal state. X-ray of the left hand reported a bone age of 8.3 years and abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of testicles in the rudimentary bags at the level of the inguinal canal and the absence of a uterus.
The diagnostic impression after the initial clinical evaluation suggested an undervirilized 46 XY individual; thus, defect in testosterone biosynthesis, an enzymatic defect in dihydrotestosterone production, or a failure in the testosterone receptor was ruled out. An HCG stimulation test was conducted, which consisted of dosing of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone at baseline and 72 h after the administration of 1,500 units of HCG IM daily for three days, confirming the presence of functioning testicles and ruling out type 2 5-alpha-reductase deficiencies. Consequently, as a result of the studies conducted, the main diagnostic suspicion was partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS).
The patient was raised as a girl; however, since childhood, the patient presented masculine behaviors. At home, the patient preferred to help with the tasks performed by the father such as heavy farm work and at school, and participated in the activities carried out by the boys. The patient identified himself with the masculine gender and felt uncomfortable with the female appearance. The evaluation by child and adolescent psychiatry did not show alterations in mood or personality disorder. He did not like having long hair or wearing “pink or purple clothes,” as he says.
For this case, a medical meeting was held with psychiatry, endocrinology, pediatrics, and pediatric urology services, in which the patient’s decision to opt for the male sex was accepted, after acceptance by the parents. Therefore, the pediatric urology service scheduled the patient for bilateral orchidopexy (Figure ), phalloplasty, and scrotoplasty. The patient is currently continuing his outpatient controls on endocrinology, pediatrics, and urology; he receives 125 mg of intramuscular testosterone every two weeks. The molecular study of the androgen receptor confirmed the diagnosis due to an abnormal CAG repetition at the AR gene in the Xq11-12 chromosome.

Chest auscultation revealed bilaterally equal and diminished breath sounds with pulse oximetry saturation decreasing from 99% to 96%. DLT was removed and before a second left endobronchial intubation attempt, examination of the DLT showed no carinal hook (Figure ). An 8.0 mm ID single-lumen endotracheal tube was placed and then fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. An increased in pulse oximetry saturation (from 95% to 99%) with normal chest auscultation was noted. The fiberoptic examination showed the carinal hook located in the right mainstem bronchus, which was removed with the use of forceps. No evidence of a traumatized airway was noted. Two further attempts were made with another 37F Carlens DLT, by a different physician and with the aid of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (external diameter: 4.5 mm). However, DLT rotation failed because of a narrowed trachea. Smaller DLTs were not available. Thoracotomy was performed in left position with an 8.0 mm ID single-lumen endotracheal tube.

A subsequent fetal echocardiogram showed additional vascular anomalies such as bilateral superior vena cava (SVC), left SVC draining into the coronary sinus, and an interrupted inferior vena cava (IVC) with a continuation of the azygos vein to the right SVC. Family history was negative for congenital anomalies. There was no in utero exposure to any known teratogens. Physical examination revealed a weight of 3200 g (50th centile), length of 48 cm (30th centile), and a head circumference of 34 cm (60th centile). No visible anomalies were noted. The infant was mildly cyanotic with pulse oximetric saturation values of 85%–94%. Postnatal echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of TAPVR draining to the coronary sinus, bilateral SVC without bridging vein, interrupted IVC with azygos vein continuing to the right SVC, and a large (4 mm) secundum type of ASD []. A small perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) and a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were also noted []. Electrocardiogram confirmed 2:1 heart block with a resting heart rate of 60 beats/min []. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal appearance and location of liver and spleen. The infant underwent cardiac surgery and a permanent pacemaker placement at 9 days of age. She was discharged home at 3 weeks of age. When seen at 2-month follow-up, she was doing well.
A CGH array analysis of a peripheral blood sample revealed an 818 kb duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1 − arr 1q32.2 (209,809,645 − 210,427,436) × 3 []. Single nucleotide polymorphism oligonucleotide microarray analysis indicated a gain of chromosome 1 from positions 209,609,645 − 2010,427,436.

3054,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-7362665-1,Extracted,"A 61-year-old female former smoker presented with increasing dyspnea and productive cough with white expectoration for a few days. She denied fever, chest pain, palpitation, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and edema. She had unintentional weight loss of 20 lbs along with loss of appetite. She had past medical history of bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma and was treated with rituximab. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan two months prior to the admission showed left lower lobe mass with obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus, and diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules with moderate left pleural effusion. Subsequently, she received chemotherapy with obintuzumab and bendamustine.
On admission, she was afebrile, sinus tachycardia 110/min, normotensive, respiratory rate 25/min and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 L nasal cannula oxygen. There was neither jugular venous distension nor pedal edema. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2 without murmur or added sound. Lung auscultation revealed diminished breath sound over the left hemithorax. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Her electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with the rate of 109/min. Complete blood count showed normocytic anemia with hemoglobin 9 g/dl which was stable compared to that two months ago. Blood chemistry was within normal limits. Chest X- ray showed opacification of the left hemithorax (Figure ).
Given these observed findings along with the elevated risk of thrombosis in active cancer, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed (Figure ). CT chest ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed a large filling defect within the left atrium, left inferior and superior pulmonary veins. It was suspected to be a thrombus since it was not reported on earlier PET scan. Apixaban was initiated given the concern for thromboembolism.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 3 x 3 cm, mobile, echogenic mass in the left atrium best seen in the parasternal long axis view (Figure ). Her left atrial size was reported to be normal. Her left ventricular size and function were also within normal limit. Further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was considered. However, the patient did not provide consent for TEE after being informed about the risks of the procedure.
To offer the best characterization of soft tissue cardiac masses, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed (Figure ). It confirmed a bulky left lung mass suggestive of carcinoma invading the left atrium via the left pulmonary veins. There was bulky intraluminal tumor thrombus and extensive mediastinal invasion by tumor. CT-guided biopsy of left lung mass was suggestive of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). A diagnosis of dual synchronous cancers, BALT lymphoma and NSCLC, adenocarcinoma to be exact, with cardiac invasion was made. As of now, we are not sure about the relationship between these two tumors. We do not know which one had invaded the left atrium. She continued to receive palliative chemotherapy.

3078,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-7977182-1,Extracted,"A 23-year-old Caucasian male presented to a rural hospital with a 1-week history of left lower limb pain, edema, and pallor. His symptoms commenced 1 week prior to hospital admission, starting with pain in the entire left lower limb, and then edema, with the thigh worse than the lower leg, and finally pallor of the entire left lower limb. He denied any trauma, history of thromboembolic disease, shortness of breath, chest pain, alcohol consumption, smoking history, recreational drug use, or family history of hypercoagulable disorders. Past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was managed with oral gliclazide MR 120 mg once daily and oral metformin XR 1000 mg once daily. He has no other significant medical history or family history and was not on any other regular medications. He was unemployed and lived in a rural town with a friend. On clinical examination, his left thigh was more swollen than his lower leg, with associated tenderness and pallor. The left femoral, popliteal, tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable. His lower-limb neurological examination was normal, with intact sensation and 5/5 power in all movements bilaterally. He had a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and was afebrile at 36.5 ℃. Initial assessment with computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrated no significant arterial disease. He was then found to have extensive DVT over the entire length of the left lower limb on venous Doppler ultrasound (US), involving the left fibular, soleus, and gastrocnemius veins up to the popliteal vein, femoral vein, common femoral vein, and external iliac vein (Fig. ). He had normal renal function, serum urea, electrolyte levels, creatine kinase, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and full blood examination. He had elevated serum C-reactive protein at 59 mg/L (normal range <10), a slightly elevated fibrinogen at 5.0 g/L (normal range 1.5–4.0 g/L), and mildly high gamma-glutamyl transferase of 107 U/L (normal range <65 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase of 135 U/L (normal range 30–110 U/L). Otherwise, his coagulation profile and liver function test were normal. Plasma D-dimer was 12.62 µg/ml fibrinogen-equivalent units (normal range <0.50). The initial impression of the clinical picture was phlegmasia alba dolens. He was given an intravenous heparin loading dose of 5000 units and then commenced on an intravenous heparin infusion at a rate of 1080 units per hour, titrated according to the activated partial thromboplastin time (target range of 60–85 seconds) and transferred to the vascular surgery unit of a metropolitan hospital for further management.
Further investigation with CT pulmonary angiogram and CT venography of the abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral interlobar and segmental pulmonary emboli, and compression of the left common iliac vein with an extensive thrombus of the left common iliac, internal, and external iliac veins, consistent with MTS (Figs. and ). The Interventional Radiology team subsequently inserted a temporary Cook Celect Platinum inferior vena cava (IVC) filter via the right internal jugular vein. The left common iliac vein was cannulated, and venography showed an extensive thrombus across the left common femoral, external, and common iliac veins. AngioJet mechanical thrombectomy, thrombolysis using 200,000 units of urokinase, angioplasty, and stenting of the left common femoral, external, and common iliac veins, using two Cook Zilver Vena venous self-expanding stents of 16-mm diameter and 63-mm length each were all performed successfully (Fig. ). On discharge from hospital, he wore left lower limb compression stockings, and the heparin infusion was switched to subcutaneous therapeutic enoxaparin 60 units twice per day. Oral anticoagulation was not used because of its slightly higher risk of future thrombosis, when compared with enoxaparin. He received intravenous heparin infusion for 4 days. His IVC filter was removed 10 weeks later without complication.
Therapeutic enoxaparin was continued until a follow-up appointment at the hematology clinic 4 months later. His thrombophilia screen was overall negative, with a negative prothrombin gene mutation, normal protein C, protein S, lupus anticoagulant, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1, and anticardiolipin antibody. He had marginally low antithrombin at 73% (normal range 80–120%); however, this may have been related to the presence of thrombosis or heparin therapy at the time of testing, rather than an underlying genetic disorder. Factor V Leiden will be tested at his next appointment. He was advised to remain on anticoagulation until next follow-up and was switched from therapeutic enoxaparin to oral apixaban 5 mg twice per day because of convenience of use despite a slightly higher risk of future clots.

In the past four months, he experienced some episodes of low urinary tract symptoms and initiated treatment for hypertension.
Computed tomography (CT) documented a large heterogenic prostatic mass (59 x 35 x 33 mm) with loss of cleavage planes, numerous adenomegalies, multiple pericentimetric hepatic hypocaptating lesions, suggestive of secondary lesions, and evidence of bone involvement (Figures , ).
A urinary catheter was placed due to urinary retention. PSA was elevated with 223 ng/ml (normal <4 ng/ml) and the patient was admitted for pain control and investigation.
At admission, the patient was hypertensive (165/89 mmHg). Laboratory tests evidenced metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.58; HCO3 42 mEq/L), normal sodium of 140 mEq/L, and severe hypokalemia (2.1 mEq/L; normal 3.5-4.5 mEq/L), that showed to be refractory to adequate replacement measures. Hypokalemia investigation showed high levels of morning plasma cortisol (58 𝜇g/L; normal 3.7-19.4 𝜇g/L), high levels of 24 h urinary cortisol (12,333 𝜇g/24 h; normal range 4.3-176) with a negative overnight 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test (81 𝜇g/L; normal <19 𝜇g/L) and elevated levels of plasma ACTH (253 pg/mL; normal 7.2-63.3 pg/mL). A diagnosis of paraneoplastic ACTH-dependent CS was made. The patient was initiated on 250 mg metyrapone daily. The patient's potassium levels increased and 24 h urinary cortisol, after one week on metyrapone, decreased to 3254 𝜇g/24 h. A brain magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the absence of any pituitary abnormality and CT excluded nodules on the thyroid or adrenal gland, confirming ectopic ACTH production.

Her stones were white in color and they were easily dispersible with a diameter of 3–5 mm approximately (). She had collected her stones and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to the stones for the analysis (). The results of the analysis revealed that 45.1% of the stones were aluminum hydroxide and 44.9% were carbonate apatite and protein. Metabolic investigations were made both in serum and 24-hour urine in order to determine the etiology of stone (). Serum aluminum was determined as 32 μg/L (1–14) and calcium was 9.87 mg/dL (8.8–10.2), while urinary calcium excretion was 0.38 g/day (0.1–0.3). In her history it was determined that she was using a roll-on deodorant that was containing aluminum. After 2-month period of dismissing this deodorant, her serum aluminum level was 12 μg/L (1–14) and her urinary aluminum excretion was in normal limits (3.67 μg/day, reference range: <50).
She was evaluated with urinary ultrasound and tomography for the presence of stone disease and they were all normal.

7453,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-5757101-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old white European woman presented to our clinic with a 7-year history of unexplained progressive unilateral left thigh pain during cycling, starting at moderate intensity and increasing upon maximal exertion. She had been a spinning instructor for 13 years, with an average of 5 hours per week, before onset of symptoms. In addition, she worked as a firefighter, where she experienced identical complaints during rapid actions, like climbing the stairs. The patient reported a sensation of unilateral muscle fatigue and pain in the left thigh, starting at the vastus medialis and spreading all over the quadriceps, adductors, and biceps femoris, without symptoms in the gluteal region or calf. Complaints vanished within 3 minutes after cessation of exercise and were highly reproducible. There was no history of trauma, while her medical history included right-sided congenital hip dysplasia, primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for which she used clomipramine for 10 years. She was on no other drug therapy at time of presentation and had no history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease, or coronary heart disease. Family history was positive for familial hyperhomocysteinemia, but this was never diagnosed in her.
The woman presented with a height of 172 cm and body weight of 65 kg (body mass index of 22 kg/m2). Her resting blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg with a heart rate of 61 beats per minute (bpm). Musculoskeletal investigation showed normal back mobility and a full range of motion of hips and knees with normal muscular strength of both legs. In addition, neurological examination was normal in our patient.
Admission laboratory findings included complete blood count, which was unremarkable (). In addition, haemostatic tests, including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), INR, fibrinogen, D-dimer, DNA testing for Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A carriership, protein C activity, activated protein C resistance, and free protein S level, were all normal, while no lupus anticoagulants or anti-cardiolipin antibodies were detectable.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal anatomy with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic and diastolic volumes but suggested a slight increase in total peripheral vascular resistance ().
Since symptoms appeared during exercise, a maximal treadmill exercise test was obtained with increasing resistance, starting at 100 Watt and elevating 15 Watt every minute, until exhaustion. Complaints started at 130 Watt and the test was ceased at 260 Watt due to unilateral thigh pain and muscular fatigue. The exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no abnormalities and systolic pressures were obtained before and after exercise from the left brachial and bilateral calf for ankle-brachial index (ABI) calculation. The ABI before exercise was 1.1 on both sides, whereas directly after exercise ABI was reduced for both legs (right: 0.75; left: 0.59), where no alterations upon exercise were expected in a healthy young woman [] ().
Prompted by bilateral reduced ABI after exercise and the suggested increased vascular resistance, further vascular examinations were performed. Normal lower limb pulses without audible murmurs and a normal capillary refill (<2 sec) were found in both legs. To investigate whether this patient suffered from endofibrosis, resting arterial duplex ultrasonography was done, which revealed no stenosis and normal diameters of the external iliac artery and common iliac artery, where femoral arteries appeared to be relatively wide, as might be expected in well-trained individuals [] (). In addition, femoral intima-media thickness was within normal range (0.78 mm, reference cut off: <0.9 mm), accompanied by normal peak systolic velocity during hip extension (1.41 m/sec) and flexion (1.54 m/sec) []. At the venous level, no signs of (previous) deep vein thrombosis were observed.
Additionally, obstructive vascular pathologies were investigated by multiphase computer tomography angiography (CTA), showing no signs of intraluminal pathologies or aberrant morphology, thereby corroborating the duplex examinations and excluding endofibrosis, popliteal entrapment syndrome, arterial-venous shunts, and venous malformations.
Next, we evaluated arterial function by ultrasonic examination of carotid and brachial artery and tonometric measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Carotid intima-media thickness (0.68 mm, reference cut off: <0.9 mm []) and cfPWV (6.74 m/s, reference cut off: <10 m/s []) were unremarkable. However, carotid distensibility coefficient was lower than expected (16 × 10−3/kPa, reference value: 20–30 × 10−3/kPa) [].
Brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD, was 1%, reference value: 3.0–8.4% []) and nitroglycerine-mediated dilation, 8%, (reference value: 9.6–18.0% []) were markedly reduced. Microcirculatory studies showed normal capillary density before (74/mm2, reference value: 40.4–85.6/mm2) and after (109 mm2, reference value: 69.5–117.1/mm2) venous congestion []. Furthermore, heat-induced cutaneous microvascular dilatation was within normal limits (+1356%, reference value: 324–1762%).
Based on the symptoms and test results, we postulated impaired arterial vasodilation and therapy with isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg twice daily was started, without any effects on the symptoms. This appeared to exclude a lack of nitrous oxide as major underlying defect. In another approach, we prescribed a vasodilating agent, the long-acting calcium antagonist diltiazem 200 mg once daily, through which claudication symptoms were well controlled and blood pressure remained within normal range (24 h measurement: average 110/80 mmHg) without any symptoms of orthostasis. During 2-year follow-up, she experienced no side effects and was able to continue her work as a fire fighter and spinning instructor.",What is the patient's body surface area?

Before initiation of Harvoni, he underwent CT imaging of the abdomen with contrast which found a 5 × 6.7 × 7 cm right adrenal mass (). On physical examination, he was afebrile with a pulse of 47 and normotensive at 118/68. His abdominal exam was nontender, nondistended, without masses, or hernias. Review of systems was negative for abdominal pain, hypertension, weakness, palpitations, headache, diaphoresis, or weight gain. He was a current smoker with a 33 pack-year history. He had no history of endocrine disease. His family history was significant only for a father with pancreatic cancer. His remaining laboratory values were within normal values including a normal potassium value. The patient was seen by the endocrine service for evaluation, and biochemical work-up revealed that the ACTH level was 9.1 pg/ml (nl 7.2–63.3); AM cortisol was normal at 10.01 mcg/dl, and 24-hour urine metanephrines was less than 50 mcg (nl).
On CT imaging, the right adrenal mass contained scattered calcifications with small regions of fat. It enhanced in a peripheral globular fashion with central progression. The absolute contrast washout of 22.9% was indeterminate for adrenal adenoma (). The mass was noted to abut but did not appear to invade the adjacent liver, right kidney, and inferior vena cava. There was no adenopathy or free fluid. There was no evidence of metastatic disease.
Due to the size and atypical features of the mass, right adrenalectomy was performed. An open thoracoabdominal approach was chosen due to the patient's low lying costal margin, the size of the mass, and retrocaval extension of the mass medially towards the vertebral body.

According to his laboratory data and imaging findings, he received inpatient medical and supportive treatment including supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 and his status improved thus his SpO2 reached 99% in room air, but soon after with the patient's personal consent; he was discharged.
A few hours later, the patient returned to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea and two episodes of generalized tonic–clonic seizures. His vital signs at admission included a temperature of 38.5 °C, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98% while breathing ambient air. On neurological examination, the patient was conscious and oriented.
The cranial nerves examination was normal and his pupils were midsize and reactive to light and accommodation. His serum glucose level at the time of unconsciousness was 110 mg/dL. Other laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell (WBC), 13.00×109/L with 10% lymphocytes; hemoglobin (Hb), 12.2 g/dL; platelet, 268,000/µL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 63 mg/L; interleukin-6 (IL-6), 2 pg/mL; pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) <20 pg/mL; procalcitonin (PCT), 0.05 ng/mL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 11 mg/dL; creatinine (Serum), 0.6 mg/dL; sodium, 139 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; magnesium, 2.2 mg/dL; phosphors, 4 mg/dL; calcium, 7.5 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 170 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 56 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 87 U/L, and negative troponin. A brain CT scan was normal. Patients received anticonvulsant medications. A single 500 mg oral dose of chloroquine phosphate, Kaletra (lopinavir/ ritonavir) two 200 mg tablets twice daily, and azithromycin 500 mg PO daily were administered. With his condition improved and his inflammatory markers decreased, the patient was discharged.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [140.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [80.0, 'mm hg']}",100.0,95.0,105.0,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

The patient was 165 cm in height, weighed 100 kg, and had a body mass index of 36.7 kg/m2. Her past medical history included schizophrenia treated with risperidone and an appendectomy at the age of 8. An endometrial biopsy revealed differentiated endometrioid carcinoma with trophoblastic components. Then, she was referred to our hospital. Physical examination revealed the presence of a solid mass measuring 8 cm in the left ovary and anther tumor mass in the uterus. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a mixed echogenic mass in the left ovarian, size 138 x 90 x 65 mm; a mass invading the uterine, size 64 x 54 x 53 mm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic revealed an ill-defined large heterogeneous soft tissue masses in the uterus and left adnexa area. Preoperative chest computed tomographic (CT) scan was negative. Because of the histologic and imaging results, both of the serum β-hCG and AFP were tested and found to be elevated (β-hCG: 238,418.35 U/L, normal value ≤ 4 U/L; AFP: 800.10 ng/mL, normal value ≤ 7 ng/mL). Other markers including carbohydrate antigen (CA)-125 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were within the normal range. She underwent abdominal surgical treatment, and the left ovary and fallopian tube were removed and sent for intraoperative consultation. On frozen section, a poorly differentiated ovarian malignant tumor was diagnosed. Then, total hysterectomy with contralateral salpongo-oophorectomy, total omentectomy, and systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.
Gross morphologically, the uterus measured 16 x 10 x 5 cm. Two protruding masses were found in the endometrial cavity. Both of the 2 polypoid masses (size 6 x 5 x 5 cm and 2 x 1 x 1 cm, respectively) were infiltrating into the myometrium. And the smaller one was extending from the fundus to the cervix. The left ovarian tumor (12 x 10 x 6 cm) was involved with large necrosis and hemorrhages.
Microscopically, both of the 2 masses in the uterus were composed predominately of intermediated-sized, poorly differentiated cells without obvious nested or trabecular patterns. The tumors had deeply (> 50%) infiltrated the myometrium and showed extensive necrosis (Fig. A). In addition, multinucleated choriocarcinoma-like cells were identified in the area of confluent necrosis. Involvement of undifferentiated carcinoma (UC) components was also identified in the left ovary (Fig. B). However, fewer syncytiotrophoblasts were presented in ovarian lesion than that in the uterine lesion. Lymphovasular invasion was found. The tumor was diagnosed as DEAC metastatic to the left ovary. According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetric (FIGO) system, the case was considered FIGO stage IIIA. A panel of immunohistochemical (ICH) analysis was performed to confirm the histologic diagnosis (Fig. A–D). The results of ICH analysis are summarized in Table .[ In the uterus, focal positivity for cytokeratine (CK7), epithelia membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin was detected in the UC components suggesting epithelia neoplasms. Markers such as β-hCG, human placental lactogen (HPL), and alkaline placental phosphatase (PLAP) were positive in the multinucleated choriocarcinoma-like cells. PAX8, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) staining were absent in UC components. And, AFP and CD30 status were both negative.
Both the serum β-hCG and AFP were dramatically decreased postoperatively (Fig. ). Unfortunately, 3 weeks postoperatively, nodules were identified in the lungs by chest CT, with associated elevations in her serum β-hCG. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given since the patient declined. She was dead of extensive disease approximately 5 months after her primary surgery.",What is the patient's body surface area?

A histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was made. Three months later, he presented with multiple episodes of syncope to the emergency department. ECG showed CHB and a broad complex escape with left bundle branch block morphology (Figure ). These episodes were sudden in onset with no preceding symptoms. On physical examination, the patient had bradycardia with a regular heart rate of 32/min and normal blood pressure. On auscultation the chest was clear and there were no murmurs heard. Routine blood investigations were normal with normal serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL (0.6–1.4 mg/dL) and normal serum sodium and potassium of 4.1 meq/dL (3.5–5.5 meq/dL). Echocardiography was performed which showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no valvular abnormalities. However, there were hyperechoic areas and hypertrophy of interventricular septum and the posterolateral wall of left ventricle as well (Figure ). The patient was paced using a temporary pacemaker as the patient was symptomatic with multiple episodes of syncope and had CHB on ECG with escape rate of 32 on ECG. The chest X-ray showed a large solitary nodule in the right upper zone. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed and was suggestive of multiple metastasis in the interventricular septum, the right atrium, and the LV wall along with a large pulmonary metastasis (Figure and D). The patient also developed paraneoplastic syndrome in the form of hypercalcaemia with serum calcium of 14 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5–10.2 mg/dL) which resolved on administering fluids and zoledronic acid intravenously. However, the CHB persisted despite normal calcium levels, so a decision to implant a permanent pacemaker was taken. The patient was then taken up for permanent pacemaker implantation and an active fixation lead was positioned into the low septal position in order to avoid metastatic site on the mid septal region. An active fixation lead was chosen as it is the institutional protocol to use active fixation lead (Figure ). A sensed R wave of 7 mV was achieved with a pacing threshold of 0.6 mV indicating a good position. Post-procedural ECG showed a ventricular paced rhythm. On the fifth day post-pacemaker implantation, the patient had massive haemoptysis.

The patient's heart rate is 32.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is less than 100 bpm, and so the score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0.
Because the patient did not have an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient had a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 0 + 1.5 = 1.5.

4413,19,Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis,lab test,decimal,pmc-6280163-1,Extracted,"A 49-year-old female was referred for further evaluation of hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and thrombocytopenia. On interview, she endorsed a several year history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and very mild dyspnea with exertion. She reported that the abdominal discomfort was worse in a sitting position. At the time of initial evaluation she was feeling well with no symptoms of jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, edema, or ascites. She also reported no constitutional symptoms.
Past medical history was notable for a 10-year history of mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 90000-130000) of unclear etiology with negative laboratory workup. Past surgical history was remarkable for an enlarged and nodular appearing liver observed during laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed one year prior due to the same symptoms. The patient has been followed by a hematologist as an outpatient, and a recent liver spleen single photon emission computed tomography scan had confirmed hepatomegaly without splenomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound characterized the liver as 18.1 cm in size with no evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Patent vasculature was reported throughout with normal hepatopedal flow. The patient had also previously undergone a computer tomography-guided liver biopsy, which showed mild perivascular and pericellular fibrosis but no evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly 4 cm below the costal margin but was otherwise unremarkable. Initial labs included a complete blood count (white count: 4.6, hemoglobin: 13.5, platelets: 112000), comprehensive metabolic panel (sodium: 141, potassium: 3.8, urea nitrogen: 11, creatinine: 0.8, alkaline phosphatase: 51, total protein: 7.3, aspartate aminotransferase: 30, and alanine aminotransferase: 29), and coagulation panel (international normalized ratio: 1.0). Additional workup revealed a ferritin of 28. Antimitochondrial antibody and actin IgG were negative. Ceruloplasmin level was 32. Patient also tested positive for antinuclear antibody titer (1:80, diffuse pattern) and epstein-barr virus IgG. An elevated transient elastography score of 9.6 was also noted.
Due to concern for early cirrhosis in the setting of thrombocytopenia and an elevated transient elastography score, the patient was advised to pursue a healthy lifestyle and abstain from alcohol. A magnetic resonance venography of the abdomen showed no evidence of thrombosis or obstruction.
At this point in time the patient reported worsening, intermittent, epigastric abdominal discomfort that radiated to the right upper quadrant of her abdomen, often waking her up at night and only improved with standing upright or walking. She occasionally felt nauseous but otherwise reported no jaundice, pruritus, edema, ascites, chest pain, or dyspnea. Physical examination showed a positive hepatojugular reflux, consistent with hepatic congestion. The patient was evaluated by a cardiologist, and a transthoracic echocardiogram showed pericardial thickening but no evidence of constrictive pericarditis or systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
The patient then underwent a transjugular liver biopsy with intravenous ultrasound and pressure measurements, which showed an elevated central venous pressure at 13-15 mmHg, wedged right hepatic vein pressure with occlusion balloon measuring 16-17 mmHg, and a dilated IVC of 3 cm cephalad to the patent veins prior to reentry into the right atrium. Significant respiratory variation involving near-collapse of the retrohepatic IVC at end-expiration was noted. There was question of intraluminal narrowing of the retrohepatic IVC down to approximately 10-15 mm, which had significantly improved upon Valsalva maneuver. Right heart catheterization showed hepatic congestion with normal intracardiac and pulmonary artery pressures.
A multidisciplinary conference among the hepatology, vascular surgery, and cardiology services was held. It was suspected that the diaphragm, via the diaphragmatic hiatus through which the IVC was passing, was causing extrinsic compression of the vessel, thereby eliciting symptoms of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain. Repeat transient elastography was still elevated and the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with IVC venolysis and division of the diaphragmatic constriction. After the above intervention, resolution of previously identified constriction was noted via repeat venogram (Figures and ) and intravascular ultrasound.
Intraoperative liver biopsy revealed sinusoidal congestion with dilatation in the perivenular areas, features consistent with extrahepatic venous outflow obstruction. The patient recovered remarkably well from the laparotomy. The available pre- and post-venolysis labs are presented in Table . At her four week postoperative follow up visit, she reported resolution of her abdominal discomfort and complete ability to perform her activities of daily living without the use of any pain medications. Unfortunately, follow-up liver enzymes were unable to be obtained due to losing her health insurance.",What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?,"{'age': [49, 'years'], 'Alanine aminotransferase': [29.0, 'U/L'], 'Aspartate aminotransferase': [30.0, 'U/L'], 'Platelet count': [112000.0, 'µL']}",2.437,2.315,2.559,"The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.

The patient's concentration of ALT is 29.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of platelets is 112000.0 count/µL. To convert 112000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 112000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 112000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 112000000000.0/(10^9) = 112.0 billion platelet counts per liter.

The muscle weakness progressed to a manual muscle testing of 2/2. Therefore, her all limbs were contracted close to functional position and limitation of joint range of motion was developed. Therefore, she required complete assistance in her daily life activities from the age of 18 years. She had been wheelchair-bound when going out and bedridden in her home. She was able to swallow minced meal with full assistance and used to receive powdered medication through a gastrostomy.
She had been cognitively normal and could adequately understand our explanation about the proposed anesthetic managements. However, articulation disorders precluded smooth communication. Additionally, an ocular cherry-red spot was confirmed, and she suffered from progressive visual impairment. She was receiving levetiracetam and sodium valproate as prophylactics against myoclonic seizures of the limbs, and she had not experienced any seizures for the last few years.
She presented neither facial dysmorphism nor scoliosis. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal any intraspinal malformation. Orofacial examination revealed neither deformations nor growths such as occult tracheal granulomas in the oral cavity. She had neither neck extension restriction nor temporomandibular joint stiffness. Oral evaluation also revealed a Mallampati class 1 airway. She had no history suggestive of either obstructive sleep apnea or recurrent pneumonia. Her blood analysis, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and spirometry did not reveal any abnormality.
At the age of 49 years, she was diagnosed with left breast cancer and was scheduled to undergo left total mastectomy. Anesthesia was planned as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol and remifentanil. She positioned supine on the operating table with all assistance. The gap between contracted limbs and the table was filled with some towels. Electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, percutaneous oxygen saturation, and bispectral index (BIS) were monitored during anesthesia.
With no premedication, rapid sequence induction was performed with fentanyl 50 μg and a targeted controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. The initial effect-site propofol concentration was set at 2.0 μg/ml. After confirming loss of consciousness at an effect-site concentration of 0.8 μg/ml, rocuronium bromide 50 mg was administered before tracheal intubation. The endotracheal tube (inner diameter 7.0) was easily inserted using a McGrathⓇ videolaryngoscope.
Anesthesia was maintained with a propofol infusion at the rate of 1.5–2.0 μg/ml and remifentanil infusion of 0.1–0.25 μg/kg/min to maintain BIS value between 40 and 60. Intravenous acetaminophen 750 mg was administered and local anesthetics (10 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine) were injected at the surgical incision site. Intraoperatively, her blood pressure and heart rate stayed within 20% of preoperative values without special hemodynamic support. The surgery was uneventfully completed in 33 min and the blood loss was 1 ml.
Ninety seconds after administration of 100 mg of sugammadex, her train-of-four (TOF) ratio at the ulnar nerve recovered to 100%. She responds to her name being called with handshake, and spontaneous tidal volume was approximately 400 ml per inspiration at an effect-site propofol concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Subsequently, her trachea was extubated 20 min after discontinuation of anesthetics. In the ward, acetaminophen was administered for analgesia as required. There were neither respiratory problems nor new neurological deficits during the postoperative course. She was discharged 7 days after surgery.
Three months after mastectomy, she presented with lower abdominal pain that was diagnosed with uterine fibroids and was scheduled to undergo open total hysterectomy. Anesthesia was planned as a combination of general and epidural anesthesia. Premedication was not prescribed. Preoperatively, an epidural catheter was uneventfully inserted via the T11-T12 intervertebral space. Next, the rapid sequence induction was performed with fentanyl 50 μg, a TCI of propofol and rocuronium bromide 50 mg. After smooth insertion of the endotracheal tube, anesthesia was maintained with a propofol infusion of 1.0–1.5 μg/ml and remifentanil 0.05–0.1 μg/kg/min. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) was initiated with 4 ml/h of 0.125% levobupivacaine, with a 3-ml bolus dose and 30-min lockout time, following administration of 3 ml 0.25% levobupivacaine via the epidural catheter.
The surgery was uneventfully completed in 3 h 7 min and blood loss was 212 ml. Hemodynamic stability was maintained without the need for cardiovascular support. After administration of 100 mg of sugammadex, the TOF ratio recovered to 100%. She emerged from anesthesia and her trachea was extubated 12 mins after discontinuation of the anesthetics. In the ward, PCEA alleviated her pain, with rescue acetaminophen given as needed.

Five days prior to her visit, she had upper respiratory symptoms and a low grade fever (). Oral administration of 400 mg acetaminophen relieved those symptoms. Then, however, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema on her face and swelling of her fingers. Three days later, although the facial erythema had improved, she developed joint pain in her fingers, wrists, shoulders, and knees, for which acetaminophen did not work. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 94/50 mmHg, and pulse rate was 61 beats/min. She weighed 48 kg and was 153 cm tall.

783,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-8559208-1,Extracted,"The patient of interest is a 59-year-old man with history of ascending aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, bilateral lower extremity venous stasis ulcers, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and multinodular goiter. The patient was brought to the emergency department by ambulance following a ground-level fall while ambulating in his home. At the time of the fall, the patient stated he felt his heart racing, but denied dyspnea, chest pain, or loss of consciousness. The patient noted the deterioration of his health in the prior month during which time he stated that he was unable to properly care for his bilateral lower extremity wounds. The patient frequently attempted to clean his wounds with water and a washcloth during his daily bandage changes.
On presentation to the emergency department, he was found to be in septic shock with blood pressure of 84/53 mm Hg, heart rate of 124 beats per minute, and lactate of 3 mg/dL. His physical examination was remarkable for 3 lower extremity ulcers below the knee. On the right extremity, the patient had 2 medial ulcers measuring 8 × 5 cm (depth to the muscle tissue) and 6 × 3 cm. On the left extremity, he had 1 medial ulcer measuring 8 × 5 cm (depth to the muscle tissue). All 3 ulcers had necrotic skin and subcutaneous tissue manifested with maggots.
Initial laboratory values were also significant for C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.97 mg/L, creatinine of 3.54 mg/dL, elevated troponin of 0.06 ng/mL (which subsequently increased to 9.8 ng/mL), and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.8 × 103 cells per mL with 83.6% neutrophils. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart with a tortuous aorta. X-ray imaging of the tibia and fibula was negative for osteomyelitis but showed bilateral areas of subcutaneous gas formation suspicious of a gas-forming organism.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of septic shock and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Sepsis bundle was initiated with careful fluid resuscitation due to his heart failure and vasopressor support with norepinephrine. On admission, 2 sets of blood cultures from separate sites and a urine culture were obtained prior to the initiation of antibiotic treatment. He was then started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for focused coverage of skin and soft tissue infection with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Acute coronary syndrome protocol was initiated given the patient’s elevated troponins along with amiodarone for treatment for chronic atrial fibrillation refractory to digoxin. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for debridement of bilateral lower extremity necrotic skin and soft tissue. Thorough debridement demonstrated that muscle tissue was not involved.
On the first set of blood cultures, both the aerobic and anaerobic bottles grew gram negative rods and gram positive cocci resembling Staphylococcus species which were ultimately identified as S fonticola and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Of the second set of blood cultures, only the aerobic bottle grew gram negative rods resembling enterics which were ultimately identified as S fonticola. S fonticola was resistant only to amoxicillin/clavulanate (). Urine culture was unremarkable. On completion of blood culture susceptibility results, on the fourth day of hospitalization, vancomycin was discontinued and piperacillin/tazobactam was de-escalated to ceftriaxone.
Cardiac echocardiogram demonstrated dilation of all cardiac chambers with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed with an estimated ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. Diastolic function was unable to be assessed due to atrial fibrillation. The patient was also noted to have abnormal septal motion secondary to bundle branch block with abnormal regional wall motion due to underlying coronary acute disease and myocardial infarction. The right ventricle was noted to be moderately dilated with mild to moderate reduced right ventricular systolic function with systolic pressure of 45 mm Hg and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
On improvement and transfer from ICU to regular unit, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed which demonstrated severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15% to 20% and severe low-flow low-gradient aortic valve stenosis. In addition, TEE demonstrated a mitral valve vegetation measuring less than 1 cm attached to the posterior annulus (). A mobile echo density measuring 0.8 × 1.6 cm consistent with a thrombus was also seen in the left atrium. The source of infection leading to the infective endocarditis was determined to be the patient’s chronic bilateral lower extremity skin infection. The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
In consultation with infectious diseases, ceftriaxone was changed to cefepime in the milieu of infective endocarditis, due to increased incidence of inducible amp-C beta-lactamase production among Serratia species with use of ceftriaxone.
 For effective treatment of infective endocarditis, the duration of cefepime treatment was determined to be 6 weeks due to low suspicions of coinfection with MSSA.
The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility to complete intravenous antibiotic therapy and obtain appropriate wound care. The patient had an uneventful recovery after completing 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Further outpatient management included a multidisciplinary approach with cardiology, nephrology, and infectious disease in addition to primary care.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [59, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': True, 'Stroke': False, 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': False, 'Vascular disease history': True}",2,2,2,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.

1759,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-5467927-1,Extracted,"A 46-year-old Caucasian man with a history of repaired D-TGA presented to our clinic with complaints of exertional dyspnea and fatigue. He underwent a Mustard atrial baffle procedure when he was 18 months old. He had an intact ventricular septum, normal pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and no pulmonic stenosis at the time of the Mustard procedure. The postoperative period was complicated by a stroke with right upper extremity weakness. He had regular follow-ups in a pediatric cardiology clinic until the middle of his second decade, but then was not seen for more than 20 years. Six months prior to this presentation, he noticed increased shortness of breath on moderate exertion and was found to be in NYHA functional class II. Echocardiogram revealed systolic dysfunction of the systemic right ventricle. PAH was not suspected based on sub-pulmonary velocities on echo. He was started on a low dose beta-blocker and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in addition to his aspirin. However, he continued to have progressive increasing exertional shortness of breath. He had no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or peripheral edema. His family history was significant for D-TGA in his maternal cousin.
On examination, his blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, heart rate was 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 per min, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. He had no cyanosis, clubbing, jugular venous distension, or lower extremity edema. He had no palpable second heart sound or thrill. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal first heart sound and a loud pulmonic second heart sound with a 3/6-holosystolic murmur on the lower right sternal border. He had normal breath sounds bilaterally. He had residual right upper extremity weakness with no other focal neurological findings. Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with right axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, and right ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern. Echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophied systemic right ventricle with moderately diminished systolic function, moderately dilated and hypertrophied pulmonary left ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function, and moderate pulmonic insufficiency. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of D-TGA corrected with Mustard atrial baffle procedure (). His systemic right ventricular function was low normal with an ejection fraction (EF) of 52% and his pulmonary left ventricle was moderately dilated with moderately reduced function, with an EF of 42% (). There was no evidence of obstruction in both the systemic venous and the pulmonary venous baffles.
On invasive hemodynamic assessment, his right atrial pressure was 8 mmHg, PAP was 134/49 with a mean of 79 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was 14 mmHg. Cardiac output as measured by thermodilution was 3.8 L/min with a cardiac index of 1.9 L/min/m2. The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was 17 Wood units. With inhaled nitric oxide, there was no acute vasodilatory response. His O2 saturations were as follows: superior vena cava 72%, right atrium 73%, pulmonary left ventricle 70%, pulmonary artery 67%, and systemic saturation 95%. There was no significant demonstrable left-to-right shunt, right-to-left shunt, or baffle leak (Qp/Qs was 1). His baffle pressure was 12 mmHg. There was moderate superior vena cava baffle stenosis with a 4-mm gradient across the superior vena cava with decompression via azygous veins. He had no inferior vena cava baffle obstruction. There was a mild 6 mmHg gradient across the pulmonary venous baffle to the systemic right ventricle. Invasive angiography confirmed the moderate superior vena cava baffle stenosis but the pulmonary venous baffle could not be well visualized during the levophase. Coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries.
Ventilation perfusion scan excluded chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. His lung function test showed no evidence of restrictive or obstructive disease. His serology for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis were negative. He had no history of obstructive sleep apnea, but did not have a formal sleep study. Electrolytes, renal function, and liver function were within normal limits. Serum brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 548 pg/mL. Normal PCWP excluded pulmonary venous baffle obstruction. He was diagnosed with late-onset PAH associated with repaired D-TGA. He was initiated on upfront combination therapy with Ambrisentan and Tadalafil. Three months after the onset of therapy, his six-minute walk distance improved from 437 m to 458 m but there was no significant improvement in his pulmonic left ventricular ejection fraction by cardiac MRI. On invasive hemodynamic assessment, his PAP decreased to 86/36 with a mean of 53 mmHg, PVR decreased to 9.7 Wood units, and cardiac output increased to 4.8 L/min.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [110.0, 'mmhg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [72.0, 'mmhg']}",84.667,80.434,88.9,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

He had no significant past medical history. His vital signs were: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 121/min, and body temperature 38.2℃. Upon physical examination, there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed anemia (hematocrit (Hct) 31.8%, hemoglobin (Hb) 11.8 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) 3.92 × 103/µL, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 78 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 71 IU/L, and markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,591 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan taken prior to admission revealed low attenuation of both adrenal glands, an indication of adrenal hemorrhage or acute adrenalitis (). At that time, serum cortisol level was 17.47 µg/dL at 8 AM and ACTH level was 12.1 pg/mL (normal range: 10-90). Chest radiography taken at our emergency department showed left sided pleural effusion (). Pleural fluid was aspirated and pleural needle biopsy showed that the fluid was exudate with lymphocyte predominance and the level of adenosine deaminase (ADA) was 93 IU/L (normal range: 4.3-20.3). Stain for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on the pleural fluid was negative and pleural biopsy specimen was inadequate. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen suggested of adrenal hemorrhage or adrenalitis necessary for differential diagnosis of adrenal tuberculosis (). Therefore, the initial concern was for tuberculous pleurisy and tuberculous adrenalitis, or autoimmune adrenalitis combined with adrenal hemorrhage. The patient was started on empirical anti-tuberculous treatment, although there was no direct evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis due to the fever and his worsening condition. However, his fever and abdominal pain continued and there was no improvement in his conditin. Ten days after admission, pancytopenia (WBC 2.88 × 103/µL, Hb 10.7 g/dL, platelets 129 × 103/µL) developed. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for specific hematologic or malignant disorder. Another CT scan of the abdomen revealed an enlargement of the previous adrenal lesion which extended to the retroperitoneal space (). Twenty-two days after admission, explorative laparotomy targeting the adrenal lesion was performed and some tissue was obtained, which contained only necrotic debris. Despite conservative management, his condition deteriorated progressively. At that time, with a strong suspicion that he had a malignant disorder, positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scan was taken and it revealed both adrenal gland and multiple cervical, mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes with intense FDG uptake (). Therefore, a cervical lymph node was excised surgically after thirty eight days from admission. The pathologic finding was a monotonous arrangement of small tumor cells with positive nuclear staining with Ki-76 (MIB-1), and immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD45, CD30, and CD56 activity, but negative for CD20 activity (). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma, natural killer (NK)/T-cell, nasal type. At last, he was referred to the hemato-oncology department and received combination chemotherapy of ifosfamide, mesothrexate, etoposide (IMVP-16) and prednisolone forty seven days after admission. Unfortunately, he could not receive further cycles of chemotherapy after first cycle of treatment because of postoperative wound infection and continuous fever. His disease was aggravated despite of the chemotherapy with conservative management, and finally he died on March 20, 2007, 59 days after his first admission.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [130.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [80.0, 'mm hg']}",96.667,91.834,101.5,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior.

No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%.

The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 3.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 12.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.8 (in g/dL)) = 12.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.5 mEq/L."

His mother remembered being told that he might have intellectual disability based on blood tests and an amniocentesis; however, these test results were not available. Otherwise, the pregnancy history and delivery were normal. He weighed 6 lbs 10 oz (20th percentile) at birth, walked at 14 months, and said “mama” and “papa” at 8-9 months. During early childhood he did not want to be around other children. He adhered to routines; for example, when his father would change his favorite TV channel he would become very angry. He spoke Spanish and some English. He attended special education at a preschool level and he could count up to 100. However, he could not focus in school. He was diagnosed with ADHD and mild autism based on the DSM V criteria by a child psychologist six months prior to the neurology visit. He was started on amphetamine-dextroamphetamine ER 10 mg daily, which improved his behavior both at home and at school. He started participating more in group activities. On exam, he was found to have a high anterior hairline, a triangular face, a short chin, widely spaced eyes, prominent nasal bridge, and conical teeth (). There were no corneal opacities or preauricular scales. He was able to answer questions about his name, age, and what he liked, but there was a lack of reciprocity and eye contact. There were no tics. However, he was fidgety, could not wait his turn, was wandering about, was talking excessively in Spanish, and was interrupting his parents at times. Therefore, his Adderall XR was increased to 20 mg daily, but he became weepy and emotional; hence the dose was lowered back to 10 mg daily, but 7 months later the dose had to be increased back to 15 mg daily due to his persistent symptoms of ADHD. He was also treated for insomnia with guanfacine 0.5 mg at night. Of note, he had a history of asthma and was being treated with budesonide 0.5 mg/2 mL suspension and montelukast 4 mg daily. Family history was unremarkable. He has an 11-year-old healthy sister. There was no history of consanguinity. His EKG was normal.

Laryngoscopy was performed by an otolaryngologist, and a small pharyngeal perforation in the right side of the vallecula was seen. A cervical CT scan also showed lacerations in the same area (). Analysis of the pleural fluid on the left side was consistent with parapneumonic effusions (pH 8.0, red blood cell count 3840/mm3, white blood cell count 2880/mm3, neutrophils 95%, total protein 4.6 g/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 27198 IU/L, glucose 27 mg/dL). Intravenous moxifloxacin was started. In addition, chest tubes were inserted on both sides and supplemental oxygen was administered. Laryngoscopy was repeated 2 days later, and the previously-noted small pharyngeal perforation was not seen. Blood and pleural fluid cultures were negative, but fever and leukocytosis persisted. Antibiotics were broadened to piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin. Fifteen days after admission, a follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of air trapping around the mediastinum and regression of parapneumonic effusions.

He was detected to have diabetes mellitus 6 months ago, but received no medication. He felt unwell after taking atorvastatin and on evaluation had normal renal function (blood urea: 38 mg/dl, serum creatinine [SCr]: 1.1 mg/dl). Since he continued to feel tired, he had a review 3 weeks later and was detected to have azotemia (blood urea: 54 mg/dl, SCr: 1.9 mg/dl) and was referred to our unit. He complained of tiredness, but did not have fever, skin rash, muscle weakness or tenderness. Blood pressure was 105/80 mm Hg and pulse rate was 75/min. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Urine examination showed no albuminuria and no sediment on microscopy. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was normal (70 U/L). He denied taking any other drug, including indigenous or over the counter medications, other than atorvastatin and multivitamin capsule. He was thought to have AKI due to atorvastatin and it was discontinued. After 1 week SCr rose to 2.4 mg/dl and he underwent renal biopsy, which showed nine glomeruli, of which one showed periglomerular fibrosis. Moderate interstitial round cell infiltrates [] were seen along with few eosinophils. Mild hyaline arteriosclerosis was seen. Immunoflurescence study showed minimal mesangial deposits of immunoglobulin M and was negative for other immunoglobulins and C3. The renal biopsy was consistent with acute interstitial nephritis.
He was started on oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks and then slowly tapered the dose over 2 months and stopped. The response to corticosteroid was good and SCr improved to 1.3 mg/dl at the end of 2 months []. He was advised not to take statins in the future.
He was admitted 6 months after the initial presentation with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting. He was given atorvastatin 40 mg post PTCA, but was replaced with rosuvastatin 10 mg after 2 days in view of previous allergic interstitial nephritis attributed to atorvastatin. He was explained about the possible cross reactivity with atorvastatin and SCr was monitored on weekly basis. SCr was 1.4 mg/dl at the initiation of rosuvastatin therapy and gradually increased to a peak of 1.8 mg/dl at 4 weeks []. Serum CK was normal (55 U/L) and there was no evidence of any other etiologic factor to account for AKI during this period. After much deliberation, rosuvastatin was stopped and he was followed closely. The renal biopsy was not repeated since antiplatelet drugs could not be stopped so early after PTCA and steroid were not given in view of possible worsening of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

She was presumed to have gastroenteritis and was prescribed oral rehydration solution at a pediatrician’s office. Subsequently, she vomited six more times, and in two episodes the vomitus contained spherical, green, gelatinous toys that were about 3 mm in size. No choking or swallowing of the toys was witnessed. However, the girl’s mother believed that they were water beads and that some likely remained in the girl’s body given the disappearance of several beads at home.
The initial vital signs at the emergency department included blood pressure 90/70 mmHg, heart rate 140 beats/min, respiratory rate 32 breaths/min, and temperature 37.0°C. Her weight and height were 11.0 kg (90th to 95th percentile) and 75.3 cm (50th to 75th percentile), respectively. She had a stable and mildly anxious appearance without respiratory distress or dehydration. The abdomen was soft, non-distended, and non-tender without a palpable mass.
No intestinal obstruction or radiopaque foreign bodies were found on a plain abdominal radiograph (). However, considering the mother’s concern for residual foreign bodies, abdominal POCUS was performed using an HM70A ultrasound system (Samsung Medison, Seongnam, South Korea) to detect water beads. A 7-MHz curvilinear transducer was placed midline on the epigastrium with the patient supine and the indicator on her right side.
POCUS showed the stomach as a fluid-filled sac, indicating gastric distention due to distal intestinal obstruction or retention of rehydration solution. Moreover, seven well-demarcated, round hypoechoic items approximately 10 to 15 mm in diameter were observed in the stomach and a similar, 20 mm item in the first portion of the duodenum (, ). No other foreign bodies, masses, dilated loops of bowel, or other signs of obstruction, such as intussusception, were observed on the examination. The POCUS findings indicated duodenal obstruction by ingested water beads. Of note, this examination was completed within several minutes without sedation, use of a linear transducer, or application of extra pressure on the abdomen.
Subsequently, a pediatric gastroenterologist was able to retrieve the water beads endoscopically (). A total of 11 water beads were removed from the stomach using a retrieval net. The bead in the duodenum was first broken down by endoscopic crushing.

The size of the ulcer was 4 × 3 cm, and the calcaneal cortex was partially exposed (). There was no improvement in the ulceration following curettage and repeated local treatments for three months. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed. T1-weighted sagittal imaging showed diffuse low signal intensity in posterior calcaneus. T2-weighted sagittal imaging showed diffuse high signal intensity in the same region (Figures and ). Based on these findings, osteomyelitis of the calcaneus was diagnosed, and the patient was referred to our department.
General physical examination on admission showed that the patient was 165 cm in height and 54 kg in weight. His extremities were thin. Atrophied skin and decreased subcutaneous fat and muscle were observed in the periphery of the extremities. His external genitalia appeared atrophied. His hair was generally scarce and markedly gray. His face looked aged and had a “bird-like” appearance (). His voice was high-pitched and hoarse. When he was 32 years old, he underwent surgery for cataracts in both eyes.
His family history revealed that his parents were cousins, but there were no symptoms of note in his siblings, and no other family members had Werner's syndrome.
Surgical treatment was considered because the ulcer did not respond to conservative treatment. Under general anesthesia, the ulcer was debrided and osteomyelitis was performed followed by a curettage of the dome form as fully as possible. We drilled the calcaneus in order to improve the recipient ground circulation (). The drilling was performed manually with 1.5 mm diameter Kirschner wire (K-wire) at a number of center points, and with 1.0 mm in diameter K-wire at multiple periphery points. Five days after operation bleeding, of the calcaneus stopped and under local anesthetic the calcaneus was covered by an ultra-thin split thickness skin graft with the left thigh skin as the donor site ().

Evaluation at his primary health centre had revealed albuminuria on dipstick analysis, prompting referral to our institution. He gave no history of recent infections, arthralgia, oral ulcers, cough or haemoptysis. On examination, he had bilateral leg oedema extending up to his knees. The blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 90 b.p.m. and respiratory rate 14/min. The cardiovascular, abdomen, chest and nervous system examinations were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria, but no erythrocytes or leucocytes. The 24-h urine protein excretion was 6.3 g. The serum creatinine was 71 μmol/L (0.8 mg/dL); serum total protein and albumin were 55 and 17 g/L (5.5 and 1.7 g/dL), respectively, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were 12 and 14 IU/L, respectively. Serum cholesterol was 10.4 mmol/L (400 mg/dL), triglyceride 2.8 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein 7.2 mmol/L (280 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL). He tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV antibody and human immunodeficiency virus I/II. The antinuclear antibody test was negative.
Kidney biopsy (A) revealed 10 glomeruli, which were normal on light microscopy (LM), as were the tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments. Immunofluorescence did not reveal any immune deposits and electron microscopy (EM) showed diffuse foot process effacement.
A diagnosis of minimal-change disease (MCD) was made and the patient was started on oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day. However, the proteinuria did not show any reduction. At the end of 4 months, the daily urinary protein excretion remained at 5 g. He was deemed to be steroid resistant and treated first with oral cyclophosphamide at 2 mg/kg for 3 months, followed by oral cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day, average C0 120 ng/mL) and oral prednisolone (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 6 months, mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day for 6 months and finally a combination of tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg/day, average Tac C0 7 ng/mL) and oral prednisolone (0.1 mg/kg/day). The nephrotic state persisted throughout this period, with serum albumin <20 g/L (2.0 g/dL) and the serum creatinine 62–80 μmol/L (0.7–0.9 mg/dL) (). During the entire course of his illness, he was continued on supportive therapy with torsemide 10–20 mg twice daily, atorvastatin 20 mg/day and losartan 150 mg/day.
At this time, the kidney biopsy was repeated. LM revealed 13 glomeruli, 2 of which showed segmental collapse of the capillary tuft with an overlying crown of podocytes along with synechiae formation, 2 showed segmental endocapillary cellularity with foam cells, 2 were globally sclerosed and the remaining 7 did not show any significant abnormality (B). Tubules showed abundant protein absorption droplets along with patchy tubular atrophy occupying 20% of the biopsy area. Tubules close to the medulla showed marked nucleomegaly along with nuclear smudging associated with tubular necrosis, interstitial oedema and mild-to-moderate patchy plasma cell-rich interstitial inflammation occupying 10% of the biopsy area. Blood vessels were within normal limits. Immunofluorescence was negative for all immunoglobulins, C1q and light chains. EM showed segmental sclerosis with evidence of collapse (C). There was diffuse and extensive foot process effacement, and no reticular aggregates were seen. Ki 67 immunostain showed nuclear positivity in the podocytes of glomeruli showing collapse (D). CD 20 staining was negative. A final diagnosis of CG was made. The patient's serum tested negative by polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B-19.
In view of his resistance to the above therapies and a persistently severe nephrotic state with the biopsy showing many plasma cells, the patient was treated with 4 weekly injections of rituximab (375 mg/m2/dose). His oedema subsided and he stopped requiring the diuretic 3 months after the last dose. Six months after the last dose of rituximab, the 24-h urine protein was 1.8 g with a serum albumin of 37 g/L (3.7 g/dL). The patient has now been followed up for 18 months and remains asymptomatic.

The concentration of total cholestrol is 10.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of total cholestrol is 10.4 mmol. To convert 10.4 mmol of total cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 10.4 mmol total cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.01 mol total cholestrol. To convert from mol total cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.01 mol total cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 3.867 g total cholestrol. To convert 3.867 g of total cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.867 g total cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 3867.0 mg total cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3867.0 mg total cholestrol/10.0 dL = 386.7 mg total cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 10.4 mmol total cholestrol/L converts to 386.7 mg total cholestrol/dL. 
The concentration of hdl cholestrol is 1.3 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 1.3 mmol. To convert 1.3 mmol of hdl cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.3 mmol hdl cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert from mol hdl cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 0.387 g hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.387 g of hdl cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.387 g hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol/10.0 dL = 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 1.3 mmol hdl cholestrol/L converts to 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. 
The concentration of triglycerides is 2.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of triglycerides from mmol to mg. The mass of triglycerides is 2.8 mmol. To convert 2.8 mmol of triglycerides to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.8 mmol triglycerides * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol triglycerides. To convert from mol triglycerides to grams, multiply by the molar mass 861.338 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol triglycerides * 861.338 g/mol = 2.584 g triglycerides. To convert 2.584 g of triglycerides to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.584 g triglycerides * 1000.0 mg/g = 2584.0 mg triglycerides. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2584.0 mg triglycerides/10.0 dL = 258.4 mg triglycerides/dL. The concentration value of 2.8 mmol triglycerides/L converts to 258.4 mg triglycerides/dL. 
Plugging in these values will give us 386.7 mg/dL - 38.7 mg/dL - (258.4/5) mg/dL = 296.32 mg/dL.
The patients concentration of LDL cholestrol is 296.32 mg/dL."

Preoperative pulmonary function test (%, predicted) showed forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 0.88 L (37%); forced vital capacity in 1 second, 0.92 L (30%); forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity, 95%; and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, 8.3 L/mmHg/min (28%). Veno-venous ECMO, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation were applied to the patient for 39 days preoperatively as a bridge for lung transplantation. Preoperative chest radiography showed severe diffuse lung consolidations (Fig. A). Preoperative cardiac echocardiography showed reduced right ventricle systolic function, mild pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure 47 mmHg), D-shaped left ventricle with slightly decreased left ventricle systolic function (ejection fraction 56%).
The anesthesia was induced with midazolam 3.0 mg, sufentanil 50 μg, and rocuronium 50 mg. Initially, a 35 Fr left-sided DLT (Shiley, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) was inserted via oral route for lung isolation and blindly placed at 28.5 cm depth at the level of upper incisor of the patient according to the height-based blind positioning of DLT. However, both lungs were unable to ventilate, and the confirmation for the positioning of DLT with FOB (FIVE 4.0, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was impossible due to massive pulmonary secretion (Fig. B). Despite the effort to suck out the pulmonary secretion with the suction catheter and FOB, any anatomic structures of tracheobronchial tree were invisible. We decided to use a new DLT (ANKOR, Insung Med, Wonju, South Korea) of left-sided 35 Fr (Fig. A). After the carinal cuff of the tube passed through the vocal cord of the patient, the tube was turned to left side, and carinal cuff was inflated with 6 mL of air (Fig. B). The tube was advanced further toward left main bronchus, and it stopped at 26.0 cm of depth at the level of upper incisor of the patient. After the deflation of the carinal cuff, the tracheal cuff and the bronchial cuff of the tube were inflated with 5 and 2 mL of air, respectively (Fig. C). After the completion of right lung graft, bronchoscopic finding showed that the tube was properly positioned at the tracheobronchial tree of the patient showing the upper margin of the bronchial cuff was slightly seen at between the carina and the left main bronchial orifice without the obstruction of the tracheal lumen (Fig. D). Surgeons indicated that the use of the new DLT provided excellent operating conditions during both lung grafts. The operation time was 10 hours and 50 minutes under veno-arterial ECMO.

He had clubbing, bilateral pitting pedal edema and bilateral symmetrical areflexic motor weakness of the lower limbs (Power 1/5) and absent bilateral plantar response. Lung examination showed bilateral coarse crepitations. All peripheral pulses were equally felt and the rest of the system examination was unremarkable. His average urine output was > 1000 ml/day. His previous renal function tests were normal, with a normal serum potassium level. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spine was advised by the neurologist.
Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.28, pCO2 60, pO2 159 and bicarbonate 27.8. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, right axis deviation, PR interval of 0.20 ms, right bundle branch block (RBBB), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and ST depression/T inversion in leads III, aVF and V1-V3.
Laboratory investigations revealed blood sugar of 493 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 88 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, serum sodium of 119 mEq/L, serum potassium of 8.9 mEq/L, Hb-19.4g/dL, hematocrit-67% and WBC-8,200/cu.mm, creatine phosphokinase, was 95 IU L and thyroid profile was normal. Daily measurements of hemoglobin and PCV level did not show any evidence of ongoing hemolysis.
Chest X-ray and computed tomography chest showed bilateral cystic bronchiectasis of the lungs. Echocardiography showed dilated right atrium and ventricle, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, normal left ventricle size and systolic function and EF of 68%. Arterial Doppler of both lower limbs revealed thin plaques along the arteries with normal flow velocity.
Immediate treatment for hyperkalemia included intravenous calcium gluconate, nebulised salbutamol, insulin infusion and potassium binding resin and potassium free diet. Repeat serum potassium after one hour of conservative management was still 8.7 mg/dL. The Nephrologist started him on immediate hemodialysis, as the serum potassium did not respond adequately to medical therapy and as he was still at high risk of life-threatening cardiac events. Salbutamol nebulization and insulin infusion were continued. After one cycle of hemodialysis, medications and potassium restriction, his serum potassium was 7.1 mg/dL but his motor power improved to 4/5 in both the lower limbs (he was able to lift both his legs against gravity and mild resistance). Repeat ECG post-hemodialysis was the same. Imaging was not performed initially as he required urgent treatment for the hyperkalemia. Subsequently there was remarkable improvement in motor power, MRI spine was withheld.
He was kept on non-invasive ventilation which was discontinued the next day. He required three cycles of hemodialysis before his serum potassium reached the normal range. Throughout the course of the illness, he had no episode of arrhythmia, heart block or cardiac arrest. At discharge, his serum potassium and renal function were within the normal range. He was able to walk normally without any disturbances in posture or balance and his motor power was 5/5 in all the 4 limbs.
Follow-up was done after two weeks of discharge when he had normal motor power (able to walk and ride motorcycle) and normal potassium and renal function tests.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?,"{'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [88.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Glucose': [493.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [119.0, 'mEq/L']}",296.817,281.976,311.658,"The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 119.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 119.0 mEq. To convert from 119.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 119.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 119.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 119.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 119.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 119.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 88.0 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 493.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 119.0 + (88.0 / 2.8) + (88.0 / 18) = 296.817 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 296.817 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 296.817 mOsm/kg."

Her past medical history included pyoderma gangrenosum, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Her daily medications included alfacalcidol, salazosulfapyridine, polaprezinc, methotrexate, lansoprazole, folic acid, diclofenac, and felbinac.
On initial physical examination, she had a temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F) and a blood pressure of 111/45 mmHg, with a heart rate of 51 beats per minute. Her height was 145.5 cm, and her body weight was 45.5 kg. The patient presented with several ulcers on all her extremities but had otherwise unremarkable findings. The initial laboratory workup (day 0) showed hyperglycemia of 237 mg/dL, leukocytosis (white blood cell count [WBC], 16,040/µL), and abnormal renal function (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], 39.6 mg/dL; creatinine 1.64 mg/dL). An echocardiogram showed a heart rate of 38 beats per minute and a complete atrioventricular block.
The clinical course is shown in . The patient was treated with prednisolone 40 mg/day for pyoderma gangrenosum; moreover, tazobactam/piperacillin was administered since an infection of the ulcers was suspected. On day +19, a pacemaker was implanted to treat the complete atrioventricular block. On day +23, Gram staining of the blood culture showed numerous yeast cells that were identified as C. glabrata (), on API® ID32C (API-bioMérieux France). Micafungin 250 mg/day was administered (starting on day +23) followed by 150 mg/day (starting on day +29) after exclusion of fungal endophthalmitis. The pacemaker was removed to remove a possible source of infection on day +23. On day +30, a central venous (CV) catheter was inserted; it was subsequently removed and reinserted on day +38. On days +40 and +54, skin grafting was performed for the ulcers. As guidelines state that antifungal treatment should be completed >2 weeks after a negative blood culture (on day +31), micafungin therapy was discontinued on day +77 after a total of 54 days of treatment. On day +88, the CV catheter was removed and then reinserted. On day +105, Gram staining of the blood culture showed the recurrence of numerous yeast cells that were again identified as C. glabrata (). As this was a recurrence of the C. glabrata BSI, we re-administered micafungin 150 mg/day and removed and reinserted the CV catheter. On day+109, another skin grafting procedure was performed. On day +120, Gram staining of the blood culture showed numerous yeast cells yet again; consequently, the micafungin dose was increased to 250 mg/day and the CV catheter was removed and then reinserted. On day +127, the blood culture and the CV catheter culture tested positive for C. parapsilosis (), identified by API® ID32C (API-bioMérieux France).
Micafungin was switched to liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), as this medication is effective for both C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On day+155, liposomal amphotericin B therapy was discontinued after a total treatment duration of 28 days, as the treatment had been provided >2 weeks after the negative blood culture result (day+134). On day+156, the CV catheter was removed and the patient was discharged from the hospital after successful treatment.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

287,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-2967566-1,Extracted,"A 68-year-old Japanese male with systemic AL amyloidosis was admitted with fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and bilateral lower-extremity edema. He had been diagnosed with systemic AL amyloidosis in 1999, on the basis of the results of histopathological examination of the biopsied tissues of his kidney and bone marrow. After diagnosis, he was successfully managed with 21 courses of intermittent MP chemotherapy for seven years. Two months before admission, he developed exertional dyspnea. One month before admission, his dyspnea had become worse, and his chest radiograph showed bilateral pleural effusion, with the effusion on the right side being more severe. Thoracocentesis was performed with removal of one litre of yellow serous fluid from the right hemithorax. Pleural fluid analysis revealed that his nucleated cell count was 2600/mm3 (24% neutrophils, 71% lymphocytes); total protein concentration, 0.4 g/dl (a pleural fluid to serum ratio, 0:11); lactate dehydrogenase level, 26 IU/l (two-thirds normal upper limit for serum, 154 IU/l and a pleural fluid to serum ratio, 0:12); total cholesterol content, 11 mg/dl; and glucose level, 118 mg/dl. These findings were consistent with transudative pleural effusion. The pleural fluid cytology was negative for malignancy. The pleural fluid was cultured for bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic), fungi, and mycobacteria, and the results were negative.
Since the pleural effusion was refractory to aggressive administration of diuretics, thoracentesis with removal of one litre of serous fluid was repeated once every week. Although his symptoms were alleviated, the patient's pleural effusion gradually increased and the pleural fluid returned to the pre-drainage level after one week. The composition of the pleural fluid remained the same at all instances of drainage.
He was admitted to our hospital for treatment of refractory pleural effusion. On admission, he appeared to be comfortable while resting. He was 158.7 cm tall and weighed 65.2 kg. His body temperature was 36.5°C; blood pressure was 124 over 69 mm Hg; and his pulse rate, regular at 84 beats per minute. Diminished breath sounds in the right lower lung, slight inspiratory coarse crackles in the left basal lung, and lower extremity edema were observed. The results of the other clinical examinations were normal. Laboratory tests revealed that his blood urea nitrogen (31 mg/dl) and serum-creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) levels were elevated; creatinine clearance rate was low (39 ml/min/1.73 m2); 24-hour urine protein was 3.5 g per day; and total protein content (4.6 g/dl) and serum-albumin levels (1.6 g/dl) were low. These findings were indicative of renal insufficiency and nephritic syndrome. However, his renal function and his serum-albumin levels remained the same as those observed one year before. The serum protein electrophoresis was negative for a monoclonal spike. Bence-Jones proteins were not detected in the urine. All his immunoglobulin levels were normal. His hemoglobin level was 12.4 g/dl, platelet count 12 × 104/mm3, and white blood cell count, 5900/mm3, with a normal differential count. His levels of troponin T (below 0.01 mg/dl) and the C-reactive protein (0.2 mg/dl) were also normal. No other abnormalities were detected in any other laboratory tests. Our patient's echocardiogram showed symmetrical thickening of the left ventricular (LV) wall with slightly high echoic lesions (interventricular septum wall thickness, 14 mm; posterior LV wall thickness, 15 mm at systolic phase) and almost normal cardiac function (fractional shortening, 40%; LV ejection fraction, 0.71). These results were suggestive of infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and not acute heart failure caused by cardiac compensation.
At admission, his chest radiograph image showed a moderate effusion on the right side and slight effusion in the left. The computed tomography imaging of his chest revealed moderate pleural effusion in the right lung and atelectasis of the right lower robe (Figure ).
Thoracentesis was performed with removal of one litre of serous fluid from the right hemithorax on the second hospital day. The level and composition of the effusion were the same as those seen before. VAD chemotherapy was administered on the third day. He did not develop serious bone marrow suppression or complications. A week after the administration of VAD chemotherapy, his chest radiograph revealed significant improvement. Moreover, he did not have dyspnea or general fatigue. However, the edema in his lower extremities showed no improvement, and no obvious change was seen in cardiac indices; pleural effusion did not recur until he was discharged from the hospital (Figure ). The results of the clinical test did not change (creatinine clearance rate, 35 ml/minute/1.73 m2; daily proteinuria, 3.4 g; serum-albumin, 1.6 g/dl). He was discharged from our hospital on his 31st hospital day.
Since then, he has continued receiving intermittent MP chemotherapy. Pleural effusion did not recur for six months after he became ambulatory. However, he had a recurrence of right pleural effusion and was managed with VAD chemotherapy. Although his right pleural effusion did not increase while treating with VAD chemotherapy, the recurrence occurred immediately after VAD chemotherapy had finished. Hence, in 2006, he underwent chemical pleurodesis for recurrent right pleural effusion. After pleurodesis, his pleural effusion has not increased after he received intermittent MP chemotherapy in 2010.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [68, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.3, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",59.838,56.846,62.83,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
The patient is 68 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.3/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**68 * 1.0 = 59.838.
Hence, the GFR value is 59.838 ml/min/1.73 m²."
1577,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-8474693-1,Extracted,"A 71-year old male presented in the outpatient department in August 2019 with the chief complaint of epigastric pain of 3 mo duration.
The epigastric pain was mild to moderate, localized, continuous, with no relation to meals. There was no relief with proton pump inhibitors. There was no history of jaundice, pruritus, clay-colored stools, anorexia, weight loss, dysphagia, gastrointestinal bleeding or vomiting.
The patient had undergone coronary angioplasty for coronary artery disease in 2010 and was on dual antiplatelet drugs.
He had no addictions, and his family history was non-contributory.
The patient was conscious and oriented. His pulse rate was 80 bpm and regular, and blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. There was no pallor, icterus, or lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination and other systemic examinations did not reveal any abnormalities.
His blood investigations were as follows: Hb 13.9 g/ dL, white blood cell count 4600/µL, platelet count 166000/µL, prothrombin time 16.5 s, serum bilirubin 0.42 mg/ dL, ALT 18 U/L, AST 17 U/L, ALP 83 U/L (< 129 U/L), gamma glutamyl transferase - 33 U/L (< 71 U/L), and serum creatinine 1.22 mg/dL (< 1.4 mg/dL).
At the local medical center, he had undergone ultrasonography of the abdomen that revealed dilatation of the CBD (15 mm) and pancreatic duct (PD) (5 mm). He was referred to our center for further management. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed dilated CBD (15 mm) and PD (6 mm) with abrupt cut-off at the level of the ampulla. No other abnormalities were noted (Figure ). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a subepithelial, hypoechoic mass lesion at the ampulla 7 mm in size, causing upstream dilation of the CBD and PD. The lesion was free from duodenal muscularis propria. There was no regional lymphadenopathy.
The age and comorbidity of the patient, the limitations and diagnostic accuracy of endoscopy, biopsies and imaging for ampullary lesions, and suspicion of malignancy made us acquire the histological diagnosis of ampullary lesion before a highly morbid surgical intervention. EUS-guided biopsy was not possible due to technical difficulties of the tiny mobile lesion. Hence, ESP was considered a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention for the subepithelial ampullary lesion. ESP aids in achieving en bloc resection of the ampulla for histopathological diagnosis and staging. Thus, en bloc ESP was performed with a balloon-catheter-assisted technique as described by Aiura et al[]. ESP was carried out with a therapeutic duodenoscope (TJF Q 180V, Olympus Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a 4.2 mm diameter accessory channel. Selective CBD cannulation was achieved with a 0.035” guidewire using a sphincterotome. The linked stone extraction balloon catheter (Fusion Quattro Extraction Balloon, Wilson Cook Medical Inc., Winston-Salem NC, USA) and a 5 Fr snare were inserted over the guidewire through the accessory channel side by side. The balloon catheter alone was advanced into the bile duct, and then the balloon was expanded with distilled water mixed with contrast. The balloon was pulled back gently towards the duodenal lumen, at which point the snare was opened so that it grasped the base of the papilla next to the inflated balloon. Pulling the balloon catheter toward the duodenal lumen made it easier to snare the papillary lesion entirely by lifting the papilla from the duodenal wall and towards the lumen[]. En bloc papillectomy was performed with a monopolar electrosurgical current (ERBE Vio3, Endocut Q mode). A 5 Fr X 7 cm single pigtail pancreatic plastic stent was placed prophylactically, and a 10 Fr X 10 cm biliary plastic stent was placed after biliary sphincterotomy (Figure ).",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?,"{'Systolic Blood Pressure': [110.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [70.0, 'mm hg']}",83.333,79.166,87.5,"The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Before coming to our hospital, he went to a clinic and received amoxicillin, which resulted in no improvement of his symptoms. He visited another hospital three days before presenting to us and was hospitalized with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Although he received tazobactam/piperacillin, his clinical symptoms showed deterioration. Two days later, he was admitted to our hospital.
His vital signs were as follows: temperature, 38.1°C, heart rate of 112 beats/min, blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and saturation of peripheral oxygen of 94% with a reservoir mask of 6 L/min. On physical examination, weak respiratory sounds and coarse crackles were heard in the lower left chest.
His initial white blood cell count was 6,800/μL, hemoglobin was 14.0g/dL, platelet count was 133,000/μL, and C-reactive protein level was 34.30 mg/dL (). Arterial blood gas (reservoir mask of 6 L/min) showed that the pH was 7.44, PCO2 was 41.1 mmHg, PO2 was 69.2 mmHg, HCO3− was 27.2 mmol/l, and BE was 2.8 mmol/L. Among the viral and bacterial rapid tests performed, only the Mycoplasma antigen tested positive.
Chest radiography indicated an infiltrating shadow in left middle lung field and right lower lung field. A chest CT indicated lobar pneumonia in the lower left lobe and an infiltrating shadow in the left whole lung lobe and the lower right lobe (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with severe mycoplasma pneumonia.
Azithromycin 500 mg/day and prednisolone 30 mg/day were initiated. After admission, his respiratory condition worsened until a reservoir mask 15 L/min was required. We then changed the reservoir mask to a nasal high-flow oxygen (40 L/min, FiO2:0.8) and increased the prednisolone to 60 mg/day. In case of macrolide resistance, we additionally administrated minocycline 200 mg/day. On hospital day 4, the patient's respiratory status and inflammatory markers on laboratory findings improved.

The patient's temperature is 38.1 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 112.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 6800.0 count/µL. To convert 6800.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 6800.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 6800000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 24.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 41.1 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 3 + 1 = 4 criteria met.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 4."

Medical history taken from his mother revealed that he was born at term, weighing 3,500 g after uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. He was exclusively breastfed, and his mother had been following a vegetarian diet for many years. The case showed normal developmental features up to 6 months: smiling at 2 months, controlling his head at 4 months, and starting to roll at 5 months. During the first 6 months of life, his body measurements were at the 25-50th percentile for weight and length and at the 50th percentile for head-circumference. When the child became 6 months old, his parents recognized that their baby stopped gaining weight and became less active.
Although brisk reflexes and cranial nerve examination were normal on admission, he was lethargic, generally hypotonic, lacking smiling and failing to follow objects visually. His weight (8,600 g) and length (71 cm) were on the 10-25th percentile, and his head-circumference (45.5 cm) was on the 25th percentile. The results of general physical examination were normal; however, the case was determined to show rhagades around the angles of both eyelids and mouth as seen in the photo () [The baby's mother provided written approval to the authors to use the photograph in this case study]. Haemoglobin level, granulocyte and platelet counts were 8.8 g/dL, 6.02×103/mm3, and 308×103/mm3 respectively. Mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, and haematocrit were 97.3 fL (reference range 80-96 fL), 6×103/mm3, 2.63×106/mm3, and 21.3% respectively. The neutrophils were seen as hypersegmented. The serum cobalamin level was 117 pg/mL (reference range 211-911 pg/mL). Serum folate level was 13.85 ng/mL (reference range 3.1-20 ng/mL). Iron and ferritin levels, biochemical profile, and urine test results were normal, with normal blood and urine aminoacidography. Cortical atrophy and enlargement of subarachnoid space were evident on MRI scan (). Vitamin B12, haemoglobin levels, and mean corpuscular volume of the mother were 232 pg/mL, 12.2 g/dL, and 104.5 fL respectively.
Megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency was diagnosed through a combination of clinical and laboratory findings, including clinical presentation, increased mean corpuscular volume (macrocytosis), hypersegmentation of neutrophils, and low vitamin B12 levels.
The case was given intramuscular injection of 1 mg of cobalamin and displayed a prompt neurological recovery. Three days after the first injection, he was smiling again and was neither lethargic nor hypotonic any longer. Haematologic values improved at the second week of the treatment. His parents were pleased because the case had a great improvement in his mental and motor development. Thus, the communication skills were improved with parents, the appetite became ameliorated, and he could control his head again. He started walking when he was 18 months old. Control cranial MRI performed three months after the initiation of therapy demonstrated recovery of cerebral atrophy. Subarachnoid space width was in normal range (). With his neurologic improvement and normal haematologic values, cobalamin therapy was discontinued at the age of 18 months.",What is the patient's body surface area?

Concurrently, an enhanced computed tomography (eCT) scan revealed thickening of the upper gastric wall and enlarged lymph nodes along the cardiac region and lower mediastinum (Fig. ). Lung and liver metastases were not observed on eCT.
Biopsy results from the gastric tumor indicated a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the HER2 status was negative, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The clinical diagnosis was GE-Circ type 3 T3 N3 M0 H0 stage III (according to the 15th edition of the Japanese Classification of Gastric Cancer []). For this patient, we chose S-1 (100 mg/day) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) as chemotherapeutics (SOX) because curative resection was considered to be an excessively invasive procedure with thoracotomy. After 3 cycles of SOX, severe anorexia and diarrhea (grade 3; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0) were observed despite a dose reduction in S-1 and oxaliplatin. Therefore, we converted the regimen from systemic chemotherapy to ramucirumab (RAM) monotherapy.
Four months after the start of RAM monotherapy, the diameter of the metastatic lymph nodes was slightly decreased, but the tumor was still stable according to RECIST version 1.1 []. An eCT following 7 months of RAM monotherapy revealed progression of both metastasis in the lymph nodes and the primary tumor in the stomach (Fig. ), and we initiated nivolumab monotherapy as third-line chemotherapy. Three months of nivolumab administration (7 cycles) led to a 47% reduction in the metastatic lymph nodes, and no new metastatic lesions were seen on eCT. After 7 months of nivolumab monotherapy (a total of 14 cycles of nivolumab were administered), the diameter of the target lymph nodes showed an 81% reduction from baseline and each had reduced to less than 10 mm in size (Fig. ). Although the primary lesion of the gastroesophageal junction was still present as seen with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. ), there was no evidence of malignancy from pathological assessment with a biopsy of the primary tumor. The patient did not exhibit any adverse events and has survived with nivolumab monotherapy for approximately 2 years from her first visit.",What is the patient's body surface area?

1767,5,Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),physical,decimal,pmc-7298960-1,Extracted,"A 7-year-old boy with a negative history for any particular diseases presented with malaise and abdominal pain to the emergency room. These symptoms had appeared since 1 month before admission and were gradually worsen in the last 2 weeks. The patient had also developed polydipsia and myalgia. On admission, the patient was afebrile (body temperature [BT], 36.7), with a pulse rate (PR) of 200/min [150/min after hydration], a respiratory rate of 25/min, blood pressure (BP) of 105/65 mmHg, and blood sugar (BS) of 256 mg/ml. Oral mucosa was dehydrated but other examinations revealed no significant findings. Laboratory test results are reported in Table . The patient was admitted to endocrinology service with the diagnosis of new-onset diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1). BS was controlled (fasting BS = 100–110 mg/dl, postprandial BS = 115–140 mg/dl) by administration of insulin. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus tachycardia. On the transthoracic echocardiography, there was a mild pericardial effusion, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) of 30–35%, mild LV hypertrophy and LV diameter of 33 mm. Considering sinus tachycardia, echocardiography findings, white blood cell count (WBC) of 17,200/μl, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60, the cardiologist suggested a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy due to viral myocarditis. Treatment with dopamine (1 μg/kg), milrinone (50 μg/kg stat and 5 μg/h infusion), furosemide (1 mg/kg two times daily), captopril (6.25 mg two times daily), and carvedilol (6.25 mg two times daily) was initiated and insulin therapy was continued with the same dose. BP monitoring was conducted but the patient was normotensive. PR was gradually reduced from 140 to 150/min to 105–100/min in a few days.. WBC was decreased from 17,200 to 10,940/μl (Table ). The patient was discharged and the following medications were prescribed to be taken at home: captopril (12.5 mg every 12 h), carvedilol (6.25 mg every 12 h), insulin glargine (4 units each night) and insulin aspart (2 units before each meal). In the outpatient visits, the patient had adequate BS control, normal BP, and was asymptomatic except for a mild malaise and inadequate weight gain.
After 21 months the patient was admitted again due to HT (BP, 189/140 mmHg), nausea, sudoresis, and malaise. No headache, tremor, pallor, dyspnea, and generalized weakness were seen in the patient before admission. The BP was reduced to 140/80 mmHg and transferred to ICU. The patient developed a headache during his stay in ICU.
Doppler ultrasonography of renal veins and arteries was performed but no significant pathologies were detected. Considering the positive familial history of pheochromocytoma in his uncle and clinical suspicion for pheochromocytoma, the urinary levels of metanephrine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vanillylmandelic acid were assessed. Hormonal assays revealed elevated serum and urinary normetanephrine, norepinephrine, and metanephrines (Table ). Furthermore, a metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan and abdominal MRI were performed. Abdominal MRI confirmed the presence of a 35 × 25 × 16 mm mass at the left adrenal gland, which was hyper-signal on T2WI and hypo-signal on T1WI. The right adrenal gland was unremarkable (Fig. ). MIBG scintigraphy identified bilateral uptake increase in the regions of adrenal glands. Normal uptake was seen in other parts of the body. Bilateral MIBG avid areas in both adrenal glands were suggestive for pheochromocytoma (Fig. ). In transthoracic echocardiography, a mild LVH and a mild tricuspid regurgitating were reported. LVEF was 55% (Fig. ).
Treatment with oral Ca channel blocker, beta-blockers was initiated (amlodipine 5 mg and metoprolol 50 mg) and followed by losartan (25 mg daily) to adequately normalize BP.
The left side adrenal tumor was removed by surgery and the right side was examined but remained intact. Histopathological evaluations confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After surgery, the patient’s medications were tapered and discontinued. He remained normotensive and BS was in a normal range. The symptoms faded away and the patient was discharged with no further medications but was advised to return regularly for outpatient visits.
During 1 year follow-up after discharge, the patient remained asymptomatic. He was not receiving any medications.

On presentation, he was markedly tachypneic and in severe respiratory distress. Vital signs include an elevated blood pressure of 165/114 mmHg, a pulse of 122 beats per minute, a temperature of 99.1°F and a respiratory rate of 28/minute. On physical examination, the patient was in acute distress, diaphoretic, and using accessory muscles of respiration. Lung auscultation revealed diffuse rales. Regular rate and rhythm with no accessory heart sounds were appreciated on precordial auscultation. The patient was put on a non-rebreather mask with mild improvement in the respiratory status and subsequently intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation.
The patient’s medical history was significant for obstructive sleep apnea with noncompliance to positive airway pressure therapy due to discomfort. He had grade 1 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction on an echocardiogram 8 months ago with normal biventricular size and function. He took a trip to Florida with his wife and noticed body aches, constant non-productive cough, headaches, fatigue, and fevers with a temperature of 101°F since his return 10 days prior. He reported sick contact at his vacation, which prompted him to get checked for viral pathogens and get a chest x-ray. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 8 days prior to presentation and was followed by the Cleveland Clinic’s distance health service with daily phone encounters while he was in isolation at home. His chest x-ray had shown left perihilar opacity and he was provided with doxycycline.
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, PE, and COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Laboratory work revealed hemoglobin of 17.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 16,400/uL, elevated liver enzymes with ALT 336 U/L and AST 309U/L. C-reactive protein was elevated to 11.9 mg/dL, D-dimer elevated to 4,300 ng/mL, IL-6 was elevated to 52 pg/mL and ferritin was elevated to 5440 ng/mL. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was insignificant for any acute abnormality, troponin T was elevated to 0.0770 ng/mL and proBNP was elevated to 1312 pg/mL. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with a P: F of 220 on 80% fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2). Chest x-ray revealed bilateral hazy opacities. The patient was kept in airborne precautions. Blood and urine cultures were drawn. The tracheal aspirate was sent for bacterial pneumonia workup. A point of care lower extremity ultrasound revealed left femoral deep venous thrombosis (Figure ).
Low tidal volume lung-protective ventilation was maintained with a high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a low fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) strategy. The patient was initiated on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin based on anecdotal data. The patient was a candidate for tocilizumab therapy but was avoided in the setting of abnormal liver function. His P: F ratio suddenly started to decrease along with the elevation of troponin T and pro-BNP. Suspicion of myocarditis, as well as a PE, were high on the differential. As multimodality imaging was limited due to strict precautions to prevent spread, transthoracic echocardiography was performed revealing a normal left ventricular size and systolic function but with a moderately dilated right ventricle with impaired right ventricular (RV) systolic function, severe hypokinesis of basal and mid RV walls and septum with normal contractility of distal RV wall and apex (Video ).
The pattern of RV wall motion was consistent with acute RV strain and a positive McConnell’s sign (Video ).
The patient was started on a heparin infusion. The patient’s acute inflammatory markers trended down with medical therapy and his ARDS improved. Troponin T also returned to baseline after 48 hours.

He had undergone laparoscopic SG for morbid obesity on August 21, 2018, which led to his poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. In following 3 weeks, he lost 17 kilograms of body weight. On September 16, 2018, he was sent to our hospital due to persistent watery diarrhea, dehydration, and general weakness for 3 days. Upon the arrival at our hospital, his vital signs were blood pressure 117/57 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min, respiratory rate 18/min, body temperature 37.1°C. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia.

He was admitted for aggressive intravenous hydration. On the third day of admission, the patient's potassium level (3.2 mmol/L) and kidney function (Bun 23 mg/dL, Cr 2.57 mg/dL, eGFR 30 mL/min) were getting better, but he was getting deteriorated with drowsy consciousness. The brain computed tomography revealed no significant findings. Tracing his medical history, he was diagnosed as a bipolar affective disorder for 20 years. He was under regular follow-up in the psychiatric clinic with lithium carbonate 600 mg twice daily, risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and flurazepam 60 mg once daily. He was still taking the same dosage during these days after surgery. Lithium level was found to be 3.42 mEq/L and lithium toxicity was diagnosed. Lithium carbonate was discontinued immediately, and urgent hemodialysis was suggested by nephrologist.
After 3 courses of hemodialysis, his serum lithium level subsequently declined to 0.63 mEq/L and creatinine level to 1.58 mg/dL, while his consciousness returned normal. In the following days, neurologic sequelae were noted by muscle weakness (muscle power 2 points over bilateral dorsi-flexors and plantar-flexors) and pain sensation in both feet. The nerve conduction test revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy with conduction block. The patient was discharged thirty-five days after admission, while his serum lithium and creatinine level declined to 0.06 mEq/L and 1.05 mg/dl, respectively.

Down syndrome was suspected clinically at birth and confirmed by karyotyping (47XX, t21).
The body weight on admission was 14.5 kg and the body height was 93 cm (20th and 5th percentile for sex and age in Down syndrome, respectively) ().
Typical features of Down syndrome were present, including typical facies and generalized hypotonia. A 3/6 heart murmur was heard on auscultation, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a low grade aortic regurgitation. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory studies revealed red blood cell count 2.14 × 1012/l, Hb 6.1 gr/dL, Htc 17.5%, platelet count 272000/mm3, white blood cell count 7800/mm3, ESR 60 mm/h, CRP 26 mg/l, urea 12.7 mmol/1, creatinine 160 umol/1, Na 136 mEq/L, K 2.7 mEq/L, Cl 108 mEq/L, Ca 9.8 mg/dL, ionised Ca 1.28 mmol/1, Mg 1.0 mmol/1, total serum proteins 59.6 g/l, albumins 32.3 g/l, fasting blood glucose 5.6 mmol/l, cholesterol 6,1 mmol/l, triglycerides 2.3 mmol/l and alkaline phosphatase 49 U/l. Results of the capillary blood gas analysis were as follows: pH 7.25, PCO2 26 mmHg, HCO3 14 mEq/L and serum anion gap 14 mEq/L.
Routine urine analysis showed mild proteinuria (+) and negative glucose. Urine microscopy showed 15 erythrocytes/hpf, 20 leucocytes/hpf and 20-30 bacteria/hpf; specific gravity was 1.005, and urinary pH was 7.0. Urine culture resulted positive for E. Coli.
Urinary uric acid was low at 774.0 umol/24h (normal values 1480-4430 umol/24h) as was citrate 21 mg/24h (normal value >115mg/24h). The urine calcium to creatinine ratio was 1.2 mmol/mmol (normal value < 1.1 mmol/mmol). In the view of normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, alkaline urine and hypokalemia the diagnosis of dTRA was made.
Additional analysis searching for etiology of dTRA revealed serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 1.2 ng/ml (normal values 10.8-54 ng/ml), parathyroid hormone 27.2 pg/ml (normal values 6.5-36.8 pg/ml), free serum T4 2.20 pmol/l (normal values 10.3-25.8 pmol/l) and thyroid-stimulating hormone >1000.0 mU/l (normal values 0.54-4.21 mU/l).

Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody was >1000.0 IU/ml (normal value <50 IU/ml) and Thyroglobulin (hTg) was 3.41 ng/ml (normal values 0.2-70.0 ng/ml). Hence, Hashimoto thyroiditis as a possible cause was postulated. Moreover, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test resulted negative.
The renal ultrasound showed hyper-echoic regions in the renal medulla consistent with bilateral nephrocalcinosis grade I (), also confirmed by abdominal CT (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed pituitary enlargement ().
Treatment and follow up
Intravenous rehydration was started. The bicarbonate deficit was calculated, and KCl was added after the patient had his first urinary void. Blood gas analysis after 12 hours revealed increasing pH, HCO3 and K values. Packed red blood cells were then administered. The patient was put on potassium citrate and thyroid hormone substitution therapy. Also, intravenous antibiotherapy and oral ferrous supplements were started to treat urinary tract infection and anemia, respectively. On follow-up after six months, no evidence of metabolic acidosis and a nearly normal serum potassium level (3.4 mEq/L) were found. Urinary random analysis was normal.

The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 6 years old. The patient's is a Male.
The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6.
The patient's weight is 14.5 kg. The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mEq. To convert from 136.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 14.5 * (136.0/140 - 1) = -0.249 L.

On exam, his vital signs were normal. His abdomen was soft but distended, and bilateral lower extremities showed pitting edema to the level of the knees. Initial laboratory studies were notable for sodium of 117 mmol/L, potassium of 6.3 mmol/L, creatinine of 9.92 mg/dL, and white blood cell count of 21 x 108/L. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was remarkable for diffuse urinary bladder wall thickening extending to the level of the seminal vesicles, bilateral hydronephrosis, diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with moderate ascites, and small low-density lesions in the right lower lobe of the liver too small to characterize (Figure ). The patient subsequently underwent emergent hemodialysis followed by interventional radiology guided nephrostomy tube placement. Nuclear medicine (NM) bone scan did not show definitive evidence of osseous metastases.
Given the rarity of peritoneal involvement of prostate cancer, the pursuit of confirmatory testing was necessary to evaluate for other primary cancers. In addition, the patient’s origin from a tuberculosis endemic region raised concern for possible peritoneal tuberculosis. Ascitic fluid cytology studies confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Immunohistochemistry staining positive for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Ber-EP4 (a monoclonal antibody used to distinguish between adenocarcinoma and reactive mesothelium) was compatible with primary prostate adenocarcinoma (Figures -) []. However, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining also showed focal signet-ring cell features concerning for possible gastrointestinal carcinoma primary (Figure ). Ascitic fluid cultures for acid-fast bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Quantiferon assays, were negative. The patient declined further tissue analysis via cystoscopy.
The patient was treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which included leuprolide and bicalutamide. Extensive discussions were held with regard to the addition of docetaxel to ADT according to the chemo-hormonal therapy vs. androgen ablation randomized trial for extensive disease in prostate cancer (CHAARTED) [], but the patient declined as he felt too weak. The patient’s total serum PSA decreased from 38.2 ng/ml to 4.7 ng/ml over four months. Repeat staging CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis that was done five months after the initiation of therapy showed an overall improvement in the peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, there was an increase in the size of some nodules in the omentum as well as a new soft tissue mass extending into the seminal vesicle consistent with progressive disease (Figure ). NM bone scan was negative for osseous metastases and patient’s serum PSA was 192.
The patient was deemed castrate-resistant with plans to start on abiraterone and prednisone therapy. Before the patient could start therapy, he developed hematuria, requiring admission to the hospital for bladder outlet obstruction from compressive effects of the mass. Repeat CT scans showed increased tumor burden including the progression of the peritoneal carcinomatosis. Although the patient was out of the window of benefit per the CHAARTED trial, he was started on docetaxel given his high volume disease while continuing his Lupron. After cycle six of docetaxel, his total serum PSA down-trended to 3.38 ng/ml with repeat CT imaging showing the response in almost all target lesions, except for an increase in the size of a nodule at the vesicoureteral junction. Given the concern for progression, the patient was subsequently started on abiraterone and prednisone. After six months of therapy, the patient had progression with worsening peritoneal carcinomatosis and a noted increase in his PSA to 4.66 ng/ml. After discussion with the patient regarding his goals for treatment, it was decided to start therapy with cabazitaxel. After one cycle of therapy, the patient had improvement of his symptoms with a decrease in his PSA. Upon completion of his fourth cycle, however, the patient developed sepsis, requiring admission to the hospital. Given his worsened functional status, the patient was deemed an unsuitable candidate for further chemotherapy and was later transitioned to home hospice.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'sex': 'Male', 'creatinine': [9.92, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [70, 'years']}",5.158,4.9,5.416,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

292,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-4955219-1,Extracted,"A 47-year-old male reported a seven day history of influenza-like symptoms, including general malaise, chills, dry cough, chest-pain, shortness of breath, and temperatures of up to 39.5 °C, which did not respond to paracetamol or ibuprofen. The patient worked as a veterinary researcher in a laboratory where experimental intranasal infections with C. abortus were developed in sheep. The patient carried out these infections using a suspension of C. abortus sprayed into both nostrils with a multi-dose spray pump, as described previously []. Ten days after the sheep infections, the patient showed the first symptoms.
The initial medical examination identified crackling sounds during lung auscultation. A chest x-ray showed areas of consolidation of the lower lobe of the left lung, indicating a pan-lobar pneumonia (Fig. ). Blood and biochemical tests revealed a non-significant increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), as well as a slight increase in urea and creatinine levels: 50.3 and 1.3 mg/dl respectively. By contrast, the C-reactive protein level was very high, 8.9 mg/dl, normal values being <0.5 mg/dl. These high values suggested a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection, in which case the values would be lower [].
Serological analyses with several ELISA tests (all of them from Vircell Microbiologist, Granada, Spain) using specific IgG and IgM monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were negative against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila (serogroup 1-7), Rickettsia conorii and Chlamydia pneumoniae.
Due to the suspicion of C. abortus infection, serum and sputum samples from the patient were sent to a laboratory at the Animal Health Department of the Murcia University (Spain) for further analysis.
A C. abortus-specific serological test, performed using an ELISA kit (ID Screen Chlamydophila abortus indirect multi-species, IDvet), revealed high IgM and IgG optical densities (OD) in the serum samples (Table ). The serum samples were tested with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG or IgM (Sigma), and the OD were determined (DigiScan with DigiWin Software, ASYS Hitech). In addition, two serum samples from asymptomatic work colleagues were analyzed with the same ELISA kit. As might be expected, both colleagues showed antibody production against C. abortus, but with a lower OD than the patient, especially for IgM production (Table ). It was therefore assumed that antibody production on the part of the patient was due to a clinical episode and not to a progressive sensitization to C. abortus.
C. abortus was isolated from the sputum using a McCoy cell monolayer, as described previously []. Positive cell cultures were identified by an immunofluorescence assay using the C. abortus-specific anti-MOMP FA2H10 MoAb []. The MoAb was produced using BALB/c mice and purified by immunoafinity, and was chosen because it is specific for an oligomer of the outer membrane protein of C. abortus (named as C. psittaci, serotype 1).
C. abortus DNA was detected in the sputum sample and also in the cell culture isolates by PCR analysis. Total DNA was extracted with a commercial kit (DNeasy tissue kit, Qiagen) and was used as a template for a C. abortus-specific PCR, using primers pmp-F (5′-CTC ACC ATT GTC TCA GGT GGA-3′) and pmp-R821 (5′-ACC GTA ATG GGT AGG AGG GGT-3′) for the target gen pmp 90/91 [], which allow the sensitive amplification of 821-bp length DNA fragments. In order to confirm the specific presence of C. abortus in the sputum sample as well as in the cell isolates, the amplicons were sequenced (ABI Prism 3130). The PCR products showed 100 % identity to the C. abortus AB7 strain sequence obtained using MEGA5 software and BLAST® program. This C. abortus strain was the same strain as that used in the experimental infections in ewes carried out by the patient [].
Once diagnosed, the patient was treated with antibiotics (levofloxacin, initial intravenous dose of 500 and 500 mg orally every 24 h for 10 days; and clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 h for 10 days), mucolytic carbocysteine lysine (2.7 g orally every 24 h), glucocorticoids (beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler 100 μg every 12 h) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (paracetamol 1 g orally in case of fever or pain). This treatment resulted in successful recovery of the patient in 2 weeks without sequels.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [47, 'years'], 'creatinine': [1.3, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Male'}",68.187,64.778,71.596,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

The patient had a history of uncontrolled blood sugar and diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient also had a history of using illicit drugs in previous years. Nevertheless, upon admission, he was found to be on daily sublingual buprenorphine. The patient was also a smoker, averaging one pack of cigarettes per day. Finally, it was noted that the patient had very poor dentation, and multiple caries were noted upon physical oral exam.
The patient was initially brought to hospital by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).
The patient's family found him to be lethargic with a distinct fruity smell from his mouth. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient was complaining of multiple symptoms, including increased leg swelling, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and poor appetite. There was no report of fever, chills, chest pain, or cough. He had history of penicillin allergy causing skin rash. The patient's history was obtained from the patient's mother.
The patient's vital signs on admission were temperature, 98.5 Fahrenheit (F); blood pressure, 98/64 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg); pulse, 101 beats per minute; and respiratory rate, 24 per minute. Cardiac exam showed tachycardia with III/VI systolic murmur. Lungs auscultation showed crackles at the bases, but no wheezing. Lower extremities had +2 pitting edema. Oral cavity showed very poor dentition, multiple caries, and necrotic teeth.
Other patient labs showed elevated blood sugar, up to 1000 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl); white blood cell count, 29 thousand per cubic milliliter (K/µL); creatinine, 2.20 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl); ALT, 15 units per liter (U/L); sodium, 141 millimoles per liter (mmol/L); and procalcitonin, 3.59 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Troponin was less than 0.015 ng/mL. Blood gases showed pH, 6.9; lactic acid, 5.3 mmol/L; and blood glucose, 1060 mg/dl; urine drug screen was negative, and urine analysis showed no leukocytes.
A computed tomography (CT) of brain was performed and was negative for any acute finding.
However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain without contrast showed small acute cortical infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere with two another tiny acute embolic infarcts in the right parietal and occipital lobes ().
Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung congestion. Two sets of blood culture were obtained and sent to microbiology laboratory. He was started on broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotic vancomycin and cefepime. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram study was technically difficult and suboptimal in quality; thus, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, and it showed multiple echodensities compatible with vegetations, associated with moderate aortic valve insufficiency, and mild aortic stenosis. The largest vegetation measures 1.6 × 0.9 cm (Figures and ).The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was approximately 30%.
Subsequently, the patient's blood cultures turned positive for Gram-positive rods, which were identified as Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Susceptibility tests were requested from microbiology laboratory, and it was manually performed using the broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. The results showed sensitivity to ampicillin with MIC equal to 1 microgram per milliliter (mg/ml), clindamycin with MIC equal to or less than 0.06 (mg/ml), erythromycin with MIC equal to or less than 0.06 (mg/ml), with penicillin MIC equal to 0.5 (mg/ml) and resistant to vancomycin with MIC higher than 32 (mg/ml). Due to the patient's history of penicillin allergy, the antibiotics were adjusted to IV meropenem. After 96 hours from admission, repeated blood culture became sterilized. Oral surgery was consulted, and the patient underwent full teeth extraction. Nevertheless, the identified source of the bacteremia was from the oral cavity. Due to the size of the vegetation and signs of congestive heart failure, the patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgeon and underwent surgery with aortic valve replacement using 23 mm Mosaic porcine tissue valve. Notes from surgery showed a large vegetation on the fused right and left coronary cusp, almost filling the aortic valve and also another vegetation on the noncoronary cusp. Tissue valve culture results showed the same organism isolated from the blood upon arrival to the hospital. Pathology of the excided aortic valve reported myxoid degeneration, focal acute inflammation with fibrinous exudate containing bacterial colonies.
The patient clinically responded well to antibiotic treatment and was discharged home to complete six weeks of IV meropenem. A follow-up and two-dimensional echocardiogram was scheduled after 3 months of end therapy, and it showed improvement in the ejection fraction up to 70%, and the bioprosthetic aortic valve was functioning normally with no signs of regurgitation.",What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Glucose': [1060.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [141.0, 'mmol/L']}",164.04,155.838,172.242,"The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 141.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 141.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 141.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 1060.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (1060.0 - 100) = 164.04 mEq/L.
Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 164.04 mEq/L."
2944,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-5965129-1,Extracted,"A 52-year-old morbidly obese male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint of syncope. The morning of presentation he reported feeling lightheaded with shortness of breath and blurry vision upon standing. He next remembered waking up on the floor. He reported worsening shortness of breath over the prior three days. Additionally, he reported experiencing a dull, constant, pressure-like sensation over the left side of his chest that had begun the night before. Initially, the patient denied any medical conditions other than morbid obesity; however, several hours into his stay we learned that he had a history of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a PE after a knee arthroscopy two years earlier.
His temperature was 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 94% on room air. His weight was 181 kilograms (body mass index of 59). The patient was awake, alert, conversing appropriately, and in no apparent distress. He was noted to be tachycardic but was well perfused, with no signs of cyanosis and a capillary refill less than two seconds. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without an increase in work of breathing. Other than venous stasis changes, his lower extremities appeared normal.
His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 103 beats per minute with a S-wave in lead I, Q-wave in lead III, and small ST-elevations in V1–V3. His initial troponin was above the normal limit at 0.17 ng/mL [0.00–0.03 ng/mL]. The patient’s metabolic panel was notable only for an elevated glucose of 206 mg/dL [85–125mg/dL]. His complete blood count was normal except for an elevated white blood cell count of 12.3 thous/MCL [4–10.5 thous/MCL]. D-dimer was >1000ng/ml [<500 ng/ml]. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was ordered to rule out PE ( and ). It demonstrated a central saddle embolism and multiple occlusive and nonocclusive lobar, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary arterial emboli bilaterally. Right heart strain and pulmonary hypertension were evidenced by enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and straightening to leftward bowing of the interventricular septum, indicating significant clot burden.
Pulmonary critical care and interventional radiology teams were consulted and after evaluating the patient, the decision was made to not start heparin and instead immediately take the patient for thrombectomy. The patient underwent clot aspiration and catheter-directed intra-procedural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration into each pulmonary artery. Post-thrombectomy angiogram demonstrated significant improvement, but showed persistent areas of clots. Following the procedure, the patient became hypotensive and hypoxemic requiring vasopressors and continued intubation.
The following day the patient had bilateral pulmonary artery EKOSTM catheters (EkoSonic® Endovascular System designed for the treatment of PE) placed for continuous tPA administration.
On hospital day three, his pulmonary artery angiogram demonstrated no visible thrombus and the EKOSTM catheters were removed. The patient remained in the intensive care unit (ICU) intubated, sedated, and receiving anticoagulants. On hospital day 4, he had sustained hypoxia and then suffered a cardiac arrest but had return of spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This event was thought to be due to a recurrent PE, and thus an inferior vena cava filter was placed the following day.
On hospital day 14, he was extubated and transferred out of the ICU. The patient returned to his baseline mental status without any breathing difficulties or chest pain. On hospital day 20, he was transferred to a skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation.

The patient's heart rate is 114.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5.
Because the patient has had an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0.
Because the patient has previously been diagnosed for pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 6.0 + 1.5 = 7.5.

She was a housewife and reported no recent travel history. There was no history of urticarial or other allergic symptoms, and she had no familial history. She had no history of smoking tobacco and alcoholism. She had a previous history of hypertension treated with amlodipine besylate for 20 years and no other medication (she was not administered new drugs). She described no trigger factors for purpura. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature, 37.2 °C; pulse, 86 beats per minute; blood pressure, 120/78 mmHg; and respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute.
A physical examination revealed significant pitting edema in both lower legs, and the confluence of palpable purpura that formed several patches of different sizes in her lower limbs, chest, and abdomen (Fig. ). There were no remarkable features in her heart, lungs, or abdominal examinations. A neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. She was afebrile and there were no signs of an infectious focus in examinations of each system. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 23.3 × 109/L, eosinophil cell count of 13.5 × 109/L, red blood cell count (RBC) of 299 × 1010/L, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 152 × 109/L (Table ). The serum total protein level was 8.2 g/dL (normal range, 6.9–8.2 g/dL), the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 280 IU/L (normal range, 106–211 IU/L), the aspartate transaminase level was 50 U/L (normal range, 5–40 U/L), the alanine transaminase level was 40 U/L (normal range, 5–35 U/L), the alkaline phosphatase level was 1564 U/L (normal range, 104–338 U/L), and the C-reactive protein level was 6.6 mg/dL (normal range, below 0.3 mg/dL). The serum creatinine level was 2.1 mg/dL (normal range, 0.40–0.80 mg/dL) and nephrotic-range proteinuria was noted. Hypocomplementemia with elevated C1q levels was observed. Serum antinuclear antibodies, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all negative. Cryoglobulins and the hepatitis B and C panels were negative. The serum β2-microglobulin level was 13.5 μg/dl (normal range, < 2.0 μg/dl), and immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and κ-light chain concentrations were 43.8 g/L (normal range, 8.7–17 g/L), 2455 IU/mL (normal range, 10–340 IU/mL), and 515 mg/dL (normal range, 3.3–19.4 mg/dL), respectively. Serum protein electrophoresis disclosed a monoclonal spike in the γ-globulin region and urine electrophoresis also revealed a monoclonal spike. Serum immunofixation electrophoresis confirmed the presence of an IgG-κ chain monoclonal M component. A bone marrow (BM) examination showed that plasma cells and eosinophils were 16.2% and 28.6%, respectively (Fig. ). A karyotype analysis showed 46,XX (20/20 cells). Interphase fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization (FISH) of BM cells revealed no gene abnormalities in 1q21, RB1, P53, D13S319, or IgH. A skeletal survey X-ray found no osteolytic lesions. A biopsy sample of accessory salivary glands showed no amyloidosis. A skin biopsy sample revealed LV showing angiocentric, neutrophilic segmental inflammation with endothelial cell swelling and fibrinoid necrosis on blood vessel walls (Fig. ). A cellular infiltrate around the vessels showed leukocytoclasia of neutrophil nuclei. IgG or IgA deposits around the vessel walls were not clear. Although hypocomplementemia was noted, no manifestations suggesting autoimmune diseases and cryoglobulinemia were observed. Allergic purpura was less likely because of the absence of abdominal pain and arthralgia. Drug-induced purpura was also not suspected because no causative drug was being taken.
The serum level of IFN-γ, which was secreted by Th1, was lower than 0.1 IU/ml (normal range, lower than 0.1 IU/mL) (Table ). Serum levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 secreted by Th2 were 50.3 pg/mL (IL-4 normal range, lower than 6 pg/mL), 56.1 pg/mL (IL-5 normal range, lower than 3.9 pg/mL), and 76.2 pg/mL (IL-6 normal range, lower than 4 pg/mL), respectively. IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-10, and TGF-β levels were lower than 31 pg/mL (IL-3 normal range, lower than 31 pg/mL), lower than 8 pg/mL (GM-CSF normal range, lower than 8 pg/mL), 45 pg/mL (IL-10 normal range, lower than 5 pg/mL), and 8.74 ng/mL (TGF-β normal range, 1.56–0.24 ng/mL), respectively.
Our patient was diagnosed as having MM IgG-κ chain type, stage IIIA according to the Durie-Salmon system and stage II according to the International Staging System. Following a definite diagnosis, she received a VRD regimen: bortezomib, 1.0 mg/m2, days 1, 4, 8, and 11; lenalidomide, 15 mg/day, days 1–21, and dexamethasone 20 mg/day, days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. After one course of the treatment, the cutaneous manifestation rapidly improved (Fig. ). Laboratory tests showed a WBC count of 5.4 × 109/L, eosinophil cell count of 0.2 × 109/L, RBC count of 305 × 1010/L, Hb concentration of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 286 × 109/L (Table ). The serum total protein level was 7.6 g/dL, the LDH level was 204 U/L, the aspartate transaminase level was 15 U/L, the alanine transaminase level was 12 U/L, the alkaline phosphatase level was 332 U/L, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.13 mg/dL. The serum creatinine level was 0.82 mg/dL and serum levels of complement bodies were normalized. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgE, and the κ-light chain decreased (13.2 g/L, 218 IU/mL, and 24.2 mg/dL, respectively). The serum level of IFN-γ was elevated (6.5 IU/mL). Serum levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-β decreased (< 6 pg/mL, < 3.9 pg/mL, 3.4 pg/mL, < 5 pg/mL, and 0.48 ng/mL, respectively). In the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the ratio of Th1/Th2 increased. A BM examination showed decrease of plasma cells (3%). She achieved and maintained a very good partial response (VGPR) following VRD regimen for nine cycles without recurrence of LV and eosinophilia.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?","{'age': [85, 'years'], 'creatinine': [2.1, 'mg/dL'], 'sex': 'Female'}",22.664,21.531,23.797,"The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

He denied any history of tobacco, alcohol, or substance use. After an outbreak of COVID-19 at his residence, a routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was done, which confirmed COVID-19 infection two days prior to presenting to the emergency department (ED). The patient complained of loss of appetite and nausea for one week while denying any respiratory symptoms. In the ED, he was afebrile and saturating 97% on room air. On examination, he appeared dehydrated and lethargic, while his lung sounds were clear and his abdomen was soft and non-tender. Laboratory workup on admission revealed white blood cell (WBC) 8900 ug/L without lymphopenia, sodium 136 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 77 mg/dl, creatinine 6.6 mg/dl, glucose 46 mg/dl, procalcitonin 6.04 ng/ml, C-reactive protein (CRP) 158 mg/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 27 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 123 U/L and total bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dl. The chest radiograph showed a faint patchy opacity in the left perihilar region (Figure ). He was admitted for acute on chronic kidney injury and hypoglycemia due to poor oral intake. He was also empirically covered with antibiotics for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
Over the next few days, the patient's kidney function improved with hydration. He had persistent nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, but no abdominal pain. A non-contrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed peripancreatic fat stranding, greatest around the tail, with mild duodenal wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding, likely from pancreatitis. The gallbladder appeared normal, without wall thickening or surrounding inflammatory changes, and the common bile duct was not dilated (Figure ). Amylase and lipase levels were elevated at 1030 U/L and 2035 U/L, respectively, but the triglyceride and calcium levels were normal. The patient was kept on bowel rest, and given continuous intravenous fluids and antiemetics. Throughout the admission, he did not have any respiratory signs or symptoms, nor did he require oxygen supplementation. Repeat chest radiograph did not show any focal consolidations. The patient's appetite eventually improved, and his diet was advanced.

A 51-year-old male patient with past medical history of alcohol and IVDU, untreated hepatitis C, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF 40%-45%), thoracic vertebral bacterial osteomyelitis, infective bacterial endocarditis with S. marcescens, s/p bioprosthetic aortic and tricuspid valves replacement was brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services (EMS) for evaluation of altered mental status, after being found unresponsive on the street. The patient had been previously admitted to the hospital a month prior to this presentation with similar complaints and was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacterial endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis with an epidural abscess. Blood cultures obtained on the prior admission grew Gram positive cocci in clusters, later identified as S. marcescens. The patient was treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, after which his sepsis resolved, and he was discharged shortly after. Presumably, in the time between the two admissions, the patient had had valve replacement surgery performed, as he presented with a sternotomy scar and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram performed on this admission revealed bioprosthetic aortic and tricuspid valves as seen in Video . On the current presentation, the patient’s mentation was altered so no history could be gathered at the time of admission. On presentation, the patient was febrile, body temperature 101.8°F, blood pressure (BP) 11/64 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 110 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 25/min, and his O2 saturation was 95% on room air. The complete blood count (CBC) revealed hemoglobin (Hgb) 11.2 g/dL (12-16 g/dL) with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 77.9, white blood cell (WBC) count 3.6 (4.8-10.8) with absolute neutrophils of 2.8 (1.4-6.5) and platelet count 18k (130-400k).
The basic metabolic panel (BMP) revealed blood glucose 99 mg/dL (74-118 mg/dL), creatinine 1.04 mg/dL (0.4-1.0 mg/dL), sodium 125 mmol/L (136-146 mmol/L), potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.6-5.1 mmol/L), chloride 95 mmol/L (101-111 mmol/L), bicarbonate 21 mmol/L (22-32 mmol/L), magnesium 1.0 mg/dL (1.8-2.5 mg/dL), and phosphorus 1.6 mg/dL (2.4-4.7 mg/dL). Lactic acid was 1.2 mmol/L (0.5-2.2 mmol/L). Radiology was insignificant, as a chest X-ray revealed sternal sutures consistent with open heart and valve replacement surgery but showed no acute cardiopulmonary events. CT studies of the head and cervical spine were negative for acute, strokes, bleeds, or fractures as well.
The patient was bloused with 3 L of lactated Ringer in the ED, as code sepsis was called, and he was given STAT doses of vancomycin and zosyn for broad spectrum coverage. Blood and urine cultures were drawn for culture and sensitivity studies. The patient was started on standing doses of antibiotics and was admitted for further management. Unfortunately, the patient’s serum sodium dropped rapidly to 121 mmol/L, likely secondary to massive IV fluid transfusion, his serum osmolarity at the time was 260 mOsm/kg (280-295 mOsm/kg) and his urine osmolarity was 611 mOsm/kg; he was started on normal saline intravenous fluids (IVF), and was upgraded to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring and correction of his electrolytes. The patient gradually regained consciousness, and his serum sodium improved to 127 in the span of eight hours, so the IV fluids were discontinued, and he was fluid restricted to prevent over-correction. Shortly after the patient became fully oriented, he opted to sign out of the hospital against medical advice. The risks were explained to the patient regarding the critical nature of his condition, but he decided to leave and not continue his hospital course.
A few hours later, the patient was again brought by the EMS after being found once again unconscious on the highway. His previous management was continued as mentioned before, and he regained consciousness shortly after admission. His condition improved in terms of body temperature, BP, and HR. Blood cultures obtained revealed Gram positive bacteremia, so his antibiotic regimen was narrowed to vancomycin alone. The patient then reported that he was on methadone treatment for heroine dependence and withdrawal and expressed the wish to be continued on it. A few hours later, the patient again wanted to leave the hospital against medical advice, and he was again counseled on the severity of his condition and the importance of completing his antibiotic regimen and hospital course, but he was adamant about leaving and left the hospital before the complete resolution of his symptoms.
Case #2
The patient was a 51-year-old Hispanic female with past medical history of hypertension, depression, chronic hepatitis C, and IV substance abuse who was brought to emergency room by ambulance with chief complaint of severe acute low back pain. Low back pain was started three days before her presentation. It was constant, radiating to legs, worsened with movement, with no alleviating factor, associated with malaise. The patient was actively using IV heroin and had previous history of heroin overdose. Her last heroin injection was two to three days before admission, around the same time that the pain started. Upon admission, the patient denied fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, numbness, tingling, and weakness of the lower extremities.
In the ED, initial vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was remarkable for disorientation, 3/6 systolic murmur, in addition to opiate withdrawal sings. Labs were significant for sodium 129 (136-144 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 30 (8-20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.5 (0.4-1.0 mg/dL), WBC 19.3 (4.8-10.8 k/uL) with neutrophil predominance, platelet 71 (130-400 K). Urinalysis was also positive for large blood and leuko esterase. MRI of spine showed degenerative changes but no concrete evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis. Trans thoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Trans esophageal echocardiogram showed moderate sized (1.6 cm x 2 cm) vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve of high embolic potential and ischemic cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle as seen in Video . CT of the abdomen showed multiple splenic and renal infarcts as seen in Figures -. The patient was started on empirical treatment with vancomycin and cefepime after first sets of blood culture was done. Blood cultures turned to be positive for S. marcescens and later antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone based on the sensitivity results.
During hospital course, the patient’s mental status was further deteriorated. Severe tachypnea and respiratory distress resulted in intubation and mechanical ventilation of the patient in the ICU. Brain MRI showed multiple foci of acute non-hemorrhagic infarcts secondary to cardioembolic disease.
Antibiotic therapy was continued for the patient and second sets of blood culture were negative. The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgeon. She was not a candidate for surgery intervention, due to unstable medical condition and multiple brain and myocardium infarcts. Hospitalization was further complicated by pneumonia with positive respiratory culture for S. marcescens and later Clostridium difficile infection. Due to multiple failed weaning trials, tracheostomy was placed for the patient. After two months of hospitalization, the patient was transferred to long-term acute care hospital. The patient was alert, able to follow simple commands, and remained ventilator dependent by the time of the discharge.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?,"{'Chloride': [95.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [21.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [125.0, 'mmol/L']}",9.0,8.55,9.45,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 125.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 125.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 125.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 125.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 125.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 95.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 95.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 95.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 95.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 95.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 95.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 125.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 9.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 9.0 mEq/L."
2998,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,decimal,pmc-7596015-1,Extracted,"A 32-year-old nulliparous woman presented into Emergency Room with colicky abdominal pain that lasted 48 h. Additionally, she had diarrhea, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, dry cough, nasal congestion, headache, and fever. She was taking antibiotics for H. pylori gastritis. Her medical history included endometriosis. She was taking oral contraceptives intermittently. She had right oophorectomy at age 22 due to endometrioma, and right salpingectomy at age 25 due to ectopic pregnancy. In-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer failed at age 29.
On physical examination: BP 80/60 mmHg. HR 120 bpm. RR 22 bpm. Temp. 39 °C. Her abdomen was diffusely distended, absent bowel sounds, generalised tenderness, without rebound. Vaginal examination was unremarkable. Rectal exam showed liquid stool. Leucocytes 18,000/μL. PaO2/FiO2 ratio 370. Abdominal CT scan with IV contrast showed small bowel diameter of 5 cm with air-fluid levels and transition point at 5 cm from the ileocecal valve (). PCR was positive for C. difficile as well as Influenza AH1N1.
Patient was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. She was kept NPO. A nasogastric tube was placed, and 2 L of enteric fluid were drained. She was started on Vancomycin 500 mg QID and Oseltamivir 75 mg BID by nasogastric tube, as well as Tigecycline 50 mg BID IV. The organ failure resolved within 48 h.
On her second hospital day, laparoscopic exploration was performed. Small bowel was diffusely dilated, and extensive intra-abdominal and pelvic adhesions were seen. The point of obstruction was at the terminal ileum next to the ileocecal valve. That segment of bowel was severely stenosed. Ileal obstruction was induced by many blue-black nodules (). On the surface of the parietal and visceral peritoneum, many lesions were visualized and biopsied ().
Due to the complexity of the case, it was converted to midline laparotomy since the exposure was not adequate to perform the surgery safely. Extensive lysis of adhesions was done. At this point, right ileocolectomy was performed. Using a 60 mm stapler, ileo-transverse anastomosis was done. No complications were reported.
Patient's recovery was uneventful. She was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on postoperative day (POD) 0. On POD 1, she had bowel sounds and slowly recovered her bowel function. On POD 4, she was stared on liquid diet. Her diet was slowly progressed and the TPN weaned. By POD 8, she was tolerating soft diet, having bowel function, and no signs of active infection. She was discharged home.
The macroscopic pathological examination consisted of a 20 cm long ileum segment and a 6 cm cecum and colon segment. The external surface was light brown, with congestive areas. The luminal surface had hematic material and showed a variable diameter secondary to stenotic areas, with purplish areas of hemorrhagic appearance. Cross sections showed small dilated cystic areas in relation to fibrosis and mural bleeding.
Microscopically, we found multiple foci along the enterocolonic wall of glandular and tubular structures, lined by epithelial cuboidal-columnar cells without atypia, surrounded by endometrial stroma with lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate, focal hemorrhage, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. There was important vascular proliferation as well as extensive subserosal fibrous bands. Immunostains for Estrogen Receptor and PAX8 were positive, which confirmed the endometrial nature of the lesions. The diagnosis of enterocolonic transmural endometriosis with serosal adhesions was established ().

The transplant was carried out without any surgical, immunological, or infectious complications. Immunosuppression was based on basiliximab induction therapy, followed by IV and then per os steroids tapered to a maintenance dose (oral prednisone 5 mg/die), tacrolimus (0.2 mg/kg/die to achieve trough level of 8–10 ng/mL for the first month and 5–8 ng/mL thereafter), and mycophenolic acid (720 mg/die). In view of the CMV R+/D− serological mismatch, the patient was given oral VGCV prophylaxis (900 mg/die based on renal function) for six months.
CMV pp65 antigenemia monitoring was negative during the patient's hospital stay and on discharge. He was discharged two weeks after transplant with serum creatinine up, 1.8 mg/dL. Serial outpatient follow-up showed a good kidney graft trend with serum creatinine up to 1.6 mg/dL at the one-month follow-up visit after transplant surgery. Laboratory tests 40 days after transplantation showed a serum creatinine increase to 1.9 mg/dL associated with raised blood immunosuppression levels (tacrolimus: 19.3 ng/mL). The patient reported diarrhea for several days. pp65 antigenemia monitoring now showed >300 cells and quantitative PCR assay of the viral genome showed 164,440 copies/mL.
The patient was admitted to hospital for further tests and treatment. On admission his general clinical status was good with normal vital parameters, no fever, and no diarrhea.
Chest X-ray and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were negative. Biohumoral tests were normal except for serum creatinine, 2 mg/dL. Oral VGCV was suspended and IV GCV (5 mg/kg/12 h) initiated. Immunosuppression was adjusted with suspension of mycophenolic acid, also in light of his recent bowel symptoms, combined with reduced calcineurin inhibitor dose (to achieve tacrolimus trough level of 5 ng/mL).
Despite antiviral therapy, there was no reduction in CMV DNAemia. Ten days after the start of treatment, genetic screening for suspected drug resistance disclosed a mutation of the UL97 gene at codon C603W (substitution of cysteine for tryptophan) conferring resistance to VGCV and GCV []. Based on the algorithm recently confirmed in the Guidelines of the Transplantation Society [], GCV was suspended and antiviral therapy switched to foscarnet with dosage adjusted for the patient's weight and kidney function (6 g/die).
Foscarnet was infused at a concentration of 24 mg/mL with dilution prior to administration through a jugular venous catheter.
In light of several literature reports on the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in GCV-resistant CMV infection [] our patient's immunosuppressive regimen was modified with the introduction of everolimus (trough level of 3–8 ng/mL) and a further reduction of tacrolimus dosage (trough level of 1–3 ng/mL). Mycophenolic acid was not used more.
Kidney function, blood count, and serum and urine electrolytes were monitored throughout treatment. Viral load was determined by PCR every three days.
Combination therapy with foscarnet and everolimus did not worsen kidney function. The patient presented three episodes of mild fever (up to 37.5°C) that resolved spontaneously. Calcium and magnesium supplementation were administered for transient hypocalcemia (7.5 mEq/L; range 9–10.7 mg/dL) and hypomagnesemia (1.1 mEq/L; range 1.4–1.85) with good response.
Two weeks after the start of foscarnet and everolimus combination therapy, the patient presented complete viral clearance (negative PCR) so foscarnet was suspended maintaining the immunosuppression regimen with everolimus (trough level of 3–8 ng/mL) and tacrolimus (trough level of 1–3 ng/mL). The patient was discharged with a serum creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Subsequent PCR assays for CMV remained negative (<500 copies) and kidney function was stable (). The patient was monitored by DNA PCR testing every three months for two years. One year after transplant kidney function was 1.6 mg/dL with negative DNAemia.
One-year protocol kidney allograft biopsy disclosed no signs of CMV infection or graft rejection but only aspecific mild focal chronic parenchymal changes (Banff 2013 score: acute alterations: all negative; chronic alterations: interstitial fibrosis 2+, tubular atrophy 1+, arterial fibrointimal thickening, negative transplant glomerulopathy, and arteriolar hyalinosis; negative peritubular capillaries C4d deposition; CMV and BKV nephropathy, both negative).

246,3,CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate,lab test,decimal,pmc-4421529-1,Extracted,"Our patient was a 56-year-old white male, who was referred to the Nephrology Clinic for a 1-week history of worsening dyspnoea on exertion, hypertension, pedal oedema and a recent increase in his serum creatinine level. Six months prior to presentation, he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) for which he required coronary artery stent placement. His home medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, enalapril and metoprolol.
On examination, the patient was obese and had bilateral pitting oedema up to the knees. His blood pressure was 196/100 mmHg (baseline was 130/86 mmHg), and pulse 66 beats/min. He had no rash, purpura or leg ulcers. Laboratory analysis revealed worsening of the serum creatinine level to 1.9 mg/dL (167.96 µmol/L; laboratory range: 0.7–1.4 mg/dL) from a baseline of 1.3 mg/dL (114.92 µmol/L). He had an associated nephrotic range proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio 11 918 mg/g creatinine), microscopic haematuria, and markedly elevated rheumatoid factor of 123 IU/mL (123 IU/mL; laboratory range: <20 IU/mL). In addition, there was a decreased level of complement C4 7 mg/dL, (0.07 g/L; laboratory range: 16–47 mg/dL) with a normal level of complement C3 98 mg/dL, (0.98 g/L; laboratory range: 90–180 mg/dL). Serologic analysis revealed a negative anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were normal. The hepatitis C RNA was 58 100 IU/mL (58 100 IU/mL; laboratory range <5 IU/mL). In view of acute renal failure in the presence of markedly elevated RF, nephrotic syndrome and active HCV serology, a presumptive diagnosis of cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis was made.
The patient refused antiviral therapy. He was thus treated symptomatically. An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a calcium channel blocker (CCB) were added to achieve blood pressure control. In addition, he continued to receive aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) as part of the management for his CAD. Even though the blood pressure improved to 130/86 mmHg after the addition of ARB and CCB, his nephrotic syndrome and renal failure worsened over the next 5 months (). The patient ultimately agreed to a renal biopsy 6 months after the initial presentation. This showed features of MPGN type 1, but with no overt evidence of intracapillary globular accumulations of eosinophilic material (‘protein thrombi’) and no ultrastructural features of cryoglobulin ().
The patient continued to refuse anti-HCV therapy, and his creatinine increased to 2.8 mg/dL (247.52 µmol/L; laboratory range: 0.7–1.4 mg/dL) in the eighth month after presentation. Subsequently, and without any change in his therapy or medication regimen, an unexpected gradual partial resolution of his nephrotic syndrome was seen, which was also associated with an improvement of his serum creatinine and a normalization of his C4 level. There was no decrease in the viral load or the level of rheumatoid factor. The HCV RNA was 58 100 IU/mL (58 100 IU/mL) on presentation and 44 524 IU/mL (44 524 IU/mL) in the 12th month.

The patient is 56 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 2.8 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.

966,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-7724407-1,Extracted,"A 58-year-old man was referred to a pulmonary hypertension clinic with a progressive
history of heart failure (III functional class NYHA) with orthopnea, peripheral edema, and
the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) according to a transthoracic
echocardiographic evaluation (TTE). The history included radiofrequency catheter ablation of
atrial fibrillation incorporating pulmonary vein (PV) isolation 10 months ago in a different
hospital. One month after ablation the patient reported shortness of breath, which was
explained by the recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation. Contrast-enhanced chest CT
was performed at a local hospital and revealed lung interstitial changes and lymphadenopathy
and signs of PH. There was no evidence of both acute and chronic pulmonary embolism
(PE).
At admission, TTE showed left atrial dilatation (left atrial volume index
42 ml/m2), preserved right ventricle size and function (4-chamber basal size
38 mm; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 1.7 cm), and preserved left ventricle
systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction 55%). The pulmonary artery was dilated
(26 mm), and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 70 mmHg.
Chest dual-energy CT-angiography (tube A—140 kV, 47 mAs; tube B—80 kV 80, 235 mAs) was
performed and revealed multiple PV stenosis (). A detailed analysis demonstrated the following
PV inflow variant: R 4b and L 2a in Marom classification. There are four separate ostia of the right PVs
(right upper lobe pulmonary vein (RUL), right middle lobe pulmonary vein (RML), superior
segment right lower lobe pulmonary vein (SSRLL), right lower lobe pulmonary vein (RLL); two
separate left PV ostia (left upper lobe pulmonary vein (LUL), and left lower lobe pulmonary
vein (LLL)). LLL pulmonary vein was present as a confluence of superior segment left lower
lobe (SSLLL) and basal pyramid veins (5 mm distal to the PV ostium). Three right PVs were
stenotic: there was a sub-occlusion of RUL, sub-occlusion of SSRLL, 70% stenosis of RLL. Two
left PVs were stenotic: 35% stenosis of LUL; total occlusion of SSLLL, and 75% stenosis of
the basal pyramid PV branch. Dual-energy CT iodine maps showed the following “perfusion”
defects: a large irregular defect in the right upper lobe, segmental defects in the right
S6, in the left S3, S6, S8, subsegmental in the left and right S10. A moderate
“hyperperfusion” of the right middle lobe was determined.
PV angioplasty was indicated, and the heart team suggested right heart catheterization
(RHC) with percutaneous PV ballooning and stenting as the first-line approach.
Under light sedation, right femoral cannulation was performed using the Seldinger
technique. RHC defined severe postcapillary PH: mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)
30 mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) 29 mmHg. An antegrade transseptal access was
performed using a Brokenbrough needle, and a steerable 8F transseptal sheath (Direx, Boston
Scientific, USA) was introduced into the left atrium. Selective PV angiography using a 6F
multipurpose catheter (Cordis, Johnson and Johnson, USA) confirmed the presence of two PV
occlusion (SSRLL and SSLLL brunch), sub-occlusion of RUL, RLL and stenosis of LUL about
50%.
Considering the number of severely stenotic PVs, a decision on a two-stage angioplasty
approach was made. Since the right lung was more “hypoperfused” according to the CT iodine
maps, the right PVs were targeted first. The right upper lobe PV was dilated and stented
with the balloon-expandable stent Renal Dynamic 7 × 19 mm (Biotronik, Germany). The lower
lobe PV was stented with the Epic stent 10 × 30 mm (Boston Scientific). Cannulation of SSRLL
was unsuccessful during the first procedure. A slight decrease in PAP was noted: from
51/20/30 to 45/18/27 mm Hg. The patient was discharged with clinical improvement on triple
antithrombotic therapy.
A second angioplasty was performed after one month. The previously stented PVs showed no
restenosis. A second successful SSRLL cannulation attempt was performed, and the Promus
3.5 × 24 (Boston Scientific) stent was implanted. A Dynamic Renal 6 × 15 stent (Biotronik)
was implanted into LLL. Balloon angioplasty of LUL was performed. Multiple attempts for
cannulation of SSLLL brunch were unsuccessful. The control RHC showed reduction of mean PAP
to 21 mm Hg and PAWP to 17 mm Hg. There were no complications during and following the
interventions.
Control CT-angiography at discharge demonstrated restored lumen of all PVs with
angioplasty, and slight residual narrowing of LUL. Triple antithrombotic therapy with
aspirin, clopidogrel, and dabigatran 150 mg BID was prescribed for one month and then
changed to a combination of dabigatran and clopidogrel. The patient significantly improved

Her previous medical records revealed she was a known case of DCMP and chronic kidney disease since 2 years. She was presently on treatment with tablet digoxin 0.25 mg, tablet furosemide 40 mg, and tablet carvedilol 12.5 mg once a day. She gave a history of repeated hospital admissions in the past 2 years with features suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) and was on regular twice weekly maintenance hemodialysis, last being 2 days before the surgery.
On preanesthetic evaluation, her heart rate was 96 beats/min, regular; blood pressure was 106/72 mmHg; respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min. On auscultation grade, three ejection systolic murmurs were audible. There were no rhonchi or crepitations. Air entry was equal bilaterally. There was no hepatomegaly, ascitis, or pedal edema. The skin overlying the hernia appeared necrosed.
The preoperative 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography demonstrated global hypokinesia, poor systolic function with LVEF of 28%, all 4 chambers dilated, severe mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly with normal lung fields. Her investigations showed Hb 7.9 g/dl, total leukocyte count TLC 12.9 × 1000/μl, platelet count 219 × 1000/mm3, urea 28.9 mg/dl, creatinine 3.6 mg/dl, sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, international normalized ratio of 1.05.
A high-risk written and informed consent was obtained in view of cardiac and renal disease. After shifting to the operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula was secured. Under strict aseptic precautions, an 18-gauge epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space at T10-11 interspace using loss of resistance to air technique. A 22-gauge right radial arterial cannula was secured since the left hand had an arteriovenous fistula. Under local anesthesia, a 7 Fr, 15 cm triple lumen central venous catheter was inserted into a right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance for intensive hemodynamic monitoring.
The following parameters were monitored: Two lead ECG (II and V5), invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide, body temperature, and urine output. FloTrac® continuous cardiac monitoring was done to monitor cardiac output, cardiac index and stroke volume variability (SVV).
Anesthesia was induced with injection etomidate 0.2 mg/kg, injection fentany l 3 μg/kg. Injection cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg IV was given to facilitate intubation with size 7.0 mm endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% air in oxygen, desflurane 4%–6%, and intermittent boluses of 1 mg cisatracurium. An epidural infusion of 0.05% ropivacaine with 2 μg/ml fentanyl was started at 5 ml/h. The CVP was maintained between 8 and 10 cmH2O, cardiac output of 6.8 L/min, cardiac index of 5.5 L/min/m2, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 835 dyne/s/cm5. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.381, pO2193 mmHg, pCO232.1 mmHg, base excess - 5.8 mmol/L, HCO3− 18.6 mmol/L.
We started injection noradrenaline infusion at 0.08 μg/kg/min and injection dobutamine infusion at 5 μg/kg/min which were tapered slowly towards the end of surgery. Surgeons found only ascitic fluid as the sac contents which was then aspirated. There was no bowel or omentum. The neck of the hernia was found to be very narrow, and defect was closed without a mesh. The procedure lasted for 90 min. Blood loss was about 100 ml. Intraoperatively, a total of 400 ml of normal saline was given. Paracetamol 500 mg IV was given as a means to achieve multimodal analgesia. At the end of surgery, after the return of respiratory efforts, the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and extubated. The patient had stable hemodynamics throughout the procedure []. The patient was shifted to surgical recovery room, and all the intraoperative monitoring was continued postoperatively. A continuous epidural infusion of 0.05% ropivacaine with 1 μg/ml fentanyl was continued postoperatively.

A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.
Initially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP).

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 124.0 mEq/mL. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is mL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.001 L for every unit of mL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.001 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 124.0 mEq sodium/0.001 L = 124000.0 mEq sodium/L. The concentration value of 124.0 mEq sodium/mL converts to 124000.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 89.0 mEq/mL. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is mL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.001 L for every unit of mL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.001 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 89.0 mEq chloride/0.001 L = 89000.0 mEq chloride/L. The concentration value of 89.0 mEq chloride/mL converts to 89000.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 15.0 mEq/mL. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is mL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.001 L for every unit of mL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.001 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 15.0 mEq bicarbonate/0.001 L = 15000.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. The concentration value of 15.0 mEq bicarbonate/mL converts to 15000.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 124000.0 mEq/L - (89000.0 mEq/L + 15000.0 mEq/L) = 20000.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 20000.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in 20000.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 20000.0 - 12 = 19988.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 19988.0 mEq/L.
Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 19988.0 mEq/L / -14976.0 mEq/L = -1.33. The patient's delta ratio is -1.33."

The QT interval is 330 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/70 = 0.857.

51,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-6182792-1,Extracted,"A 78-year-old (height 163.3 cm, weight 61.3 kg) Japanese man was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) after esophagectomy with gastric reconstruction for esophageal cancer. His body temperature was 36.9 °C and heart rate was 96 beats/minute. His blood pressure was 148/68 mmHg on ICU admission. Physical and neurological examinations were not significant. His past medical history included appendectomy (8 years of age) and lumber canal stenosis (70 years of age). He did not smoke cigarettes but drank Japanese alcohol (360 ml/day). Regarding family history, his elder brother died of esophageal cancer.
On ICU day 5, he developed new onset fever up to 38.0 °C, increase in sputum, and hypoxemia with 90% arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) with mask oxygen at 10 L/minute with bilateral pulmonary coarse crackles. Therefore, he was intubated. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates predominantly in his right lung with pleural effusion (Fig. ). Laboratory findings revealed white blood cell count 5.7 × 109/L, red blood cell count 2.25 × 1012/L, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 21.4%, platelet 145 × 109/L, aspartate aminotransferase 54 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 55 U/L, total bilirubin 4.11 mg/dL, albumin 2.2 g/dL, urea nitrogen 38 mg/dL, creatinine 0.83 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 18.7 mg/dL, and urinary creatinine 95 mg/dL after intubation. Because sputum culture revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae on ICU day 7, the antibiotic was changed from cefmetazole to meropenem.
He underwent a long period of mechanical ventilation, ultimately undergoing tracheostomy on ICU day 38. Although his oxygenation was good with partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) > 300 mmHg, restrictive pulmonary dysfunction developed: tidal volume 230–240 mL, static compliance 14–15 mL/cmH2O with 10 cmH2O pressure support ventilation, respiratory rate 34 beats/minute, and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 46 mmHg. We tried to wean him from mechanical ventilation with support by HFT setting the flow at 40 L/minute with FIO2 of 0.25 because the maximum inspiratory flow of the ventilator was 40 L/minute during 10 cmH2O pressure support ventilation. By setting the flow at the same rate as the ventilator, we hoped to reduce his inspiratory effort. HFT was used in the daytime, and a ventilator with 5 cmH2O pressure support with 5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was used at night for the first 8 days. In the next 8 days, HFT was used around the clock. Table presents the respiratory parameters during HFT. Under respiratory support with HFT, his condition was stable, and his physiotherapy rehabilitation continued uneventfully. The HFT optimally delivered humidified gas, which improved the thinning of his bronchial secretions. He was discharged from the ICU to the general ward on ICU day 127. His physiotherapy rehabilitation continued for 2 months, and he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on day 201 of hospitalization.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [61.3, 'kg'], 'height': [163.3, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.83, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [78, 'years']}",62.113,59.007,65.219,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 78 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.83 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 163.3 cm, which is 163.3 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.633 m. The patient's weight is 61.3 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 61.3 kg / (1.633 m * 1.633 m) = 22.987 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.0, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 59.869 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 78) * 59.869 * 1) / (0.83 * 72) = 62.113 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 62.113 mL/min."
2128,6,Body Mass Index (BMI),physical,decimal,pmc-8223890-1,Extracted,"A 56-year-old man weighing 102 kg and 188 cm tall (Figure ) was referred to our hospital because of an evident thickening around the neck. He had had the enlargement for the last 10 years and lately, the condition worsened. He was also a heavy alcohol drinker for the last 30 years and had 50 pack-years of smoking upon presentation. He was employed as a farmer and construction worker and had never demanded health care for his condition in the past.
More specifically, during the last 3 years, the enlargement became a collar-like mass around the neck and dyspnea crises with cough and upper airway excretions appeared, especially when bending the neck. He was relieved after some minutes of neck extension. The patient reported progressive difficulty sleeping due to extensive bulk of the mass, while he never had a problem of snoring, sleep deprivation, or other sleep apnea-associated symptoms. Additionally, he complained of weakness and chronic fatigue during these last years. The mass presented with cervical pain upon weight lifting, while he did not have any signs of neuropathy.
He referred a known history of hypertension with frequent hypertensive crises with systolic blood pressures of 220-230 mm Hg after heavy drinking, for which he used an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide and was usually referred to the local hospital. The cardiac assessment was normal. He had suffered from hypothyroidism for the last 15 years.
Upon examination, he had a circular mass of the neck, semi-hard on the anterior and hard on the posterior in a double oval-shaped configuration. The mass was not fixed to the overlying skin. His articulation was disturbed, and he had stridor while bending the head. Interestingly enough, we noticed that his legs and arms had lipohypertrophic along with lipoatrophic areas and that his supraclavicular regions were hypertrophic. The identification of the “pseudoathletic” type of Madelung's disease (type I), and hence, the diagnosis was delayed because the patient's physique was attributed to his occupation as a construction worker. Neurological examination was normal.
High values of uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, CPK, and LDH were reported. A slight elevation of SGOT along with a double γ-GT price was compatible with alcohol abuse.
A facial, cervical, and thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed a bilateral and symmetrical fat mass of the posterior and anterior region of the neck and of the upper trunk, without displacement or infiltration of the trachea (Figure ). Based on these findings, the diagnosis of Madelung's disease was made and we decided to treat the patient surgically.
Two different operations took place. In the first one, orotracheal intubation was impossible, so nasotracheal intubation was performed. A Gluck-Sorenson incision was performed, and fat tissue was excised in a similar fashion as in bilateral functional lymph node neck dissection with preservation of the accessory and marginal and cervical branches of the facial nerves. More specifically, we dissected levels I-V on the right side and levels I-VI on the left side. The dissection of the tissue in the carotid triangles was laborious (the fat tissue had septa that extended between the structures). The excised specimen's size was 27 × 12 × 18 cm, and its weight was 627 g (Figure ). A tracheostomy was performed before completion.
In the second operation, which took place 3 weeks later, the patient was placed in a prone position. The fat masses of the cervical, occipital, suboccipital, retro-auricular, and upper dorsal regions were removed surgically and with liposuction. The weight of the fat tissue was 114gram. We continued with removing the fat mass from the upper anterior cervical region. Part of the skin was removed because of its excess. The tracheostomy from the first operation remained and was finally removed 6 days after the second operation.
Histological examination after both the operations confirmed the initial diagnosis.
During the next 6 months, we suggested the use of a soft collar because we desired extra tension of the musculocutaneous tissue over the neck triangles for better healing. The patient did not follow our orders for alcohol abstinence.
In Figure , we can see the final result three months later.",What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He complained of pain and swelling of right ankle. He also gave a history of associated cough and fever since 5 days. The personal and past history was insignificant.
Patient was febrile with 38.5 degree Celsius temperature; tachycardia at 125/min and respiratory rate 25/min. Right ankle was mildly swollen with redness, local rise of temperature, tenderness over lateral malleolus, lower 3rd leg laterally (). There was restriction of ankle movements. No neurovascular deficits. Rest of the limb was normal. Plain X-ray of right ankle with leg was normal. His blood parameters were; haemoglobin-12.5gm%;total count- 21.28K/uL; neutrophils-19.77K/uL; lymphocytes-0.75K/uL%, CRP- 360.1mg/L(positive); ESR--60mm/hr; RAfactor-negative; ASO-titre- 400IU/ML; sickling-negative. Urine routine was performed and found to benormal. Patient was admitted for treatment of suspected cellulitis, pediatric opinion was sought for cough. Chest X-ray: revealed pneumonia, therefore he was started on IV Cloxacillin 1gm four times daily. Later blood culture revealed growth of Staphylococcus aureus which was sensitive to Cloxaciilin. On the 3rd day, patient’s general condition deteriorated with persistently elevated temperature, tachycardia (140/min), respiratory rate at 40/min and SPO2- 87% at room air with moderate swelling on whole of right leg with tender calf and a positive Homan sign.

The patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 140.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 21280.0 count/µL. To convert 21280.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 21280.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 21280000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 40.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 3 + 1 = 4 criteria met.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 4."
8658,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7298965-1,Extracted,"A 74-year-old right-handed Japanese man was admitted to another hospital, due to the acute onset of cognitive impairment and psychosis, accompanied by headache and pyrexia. He was treated promptly with intravenous acyclovir. Due to the deterioration of his cognitive function and mental status, he was transferred to our hospital 7 days after the onset of his symptoms. He had normal development and growth before coming of age. His past medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, angina pectoris, and chronic renal failure. He had an unremarkable family history, including a lack of neuromuscular diseases, encephalitis, and mitochondrial disease.
At admission, his height was 161.8 cm and weight was 52.6 kg. On physical examination, his body temperature was 38.0 degrees Celsius. A chest auscultation revealed normal respiratory sound and normal heart rate with no murmur. Neurological examination showed mild disturbance of consciousness: GCS 14 (E4 V4 M6), attention disorder, disorientation, psychosis that included abnormal behavior and talkativeness, and left unilateral spatial neglect. On the first day of hospitalization, he presented with no muscle weakness. Ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormal findings in bilateral fundus and oculomotor control. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high-intensity lesions in the right parieto-temporal area on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (Fig. a–c) images and diffusion weighted images (DWI) (Fig. d–f). On the lesions, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image demonstrated hypo-intensity in the cortical area and high-intensity in the subcortical area (Fig. g–i). A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample included 26 white cells/mm3, 70 mg/dL of total protein, and 62 mg/dL of glucose (100 mg/dL of serum glucose). Electroencephalography revealed periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), which manifested as high-amplitude, periodic, sharp, transient waves occurring every 1.0–1.5 s over the right temporo-occipital region (Fig. ). We initially diagnosed the patient with acute encephalitis with an infectious (e.g. herpes simplex virus encephalitis; HSVE) or autoimmune origin and continued treatment with acyclovir, while adding intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy. On hospital day 4, we discontinued acyclovir due to the receipt of negative real-time PCR results for herpes simplex virus DNA in the CSF. Moreover, autoimmune encephalitis associated with antibodies against neuronal surface antigens (e.g. anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies) was adequately excluded due to the negative results of autoantibody screening of the CSF with an in-house tissue-based assay using rat brain sections. Moreover, onconeural antibodies including Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma, amphiphysin, PCA-2, Tr, SOX1, titin, and recoverin all tested negative using line blot assay (EUROIMMUN).
The patient also developed mild muscular weakness in the left upper and lower extremities after the admission, as evaluated using the Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale, with a score of 3/5. His mental status deteriorated with increasing confusion and aggressive behavior and, therefore, we started a low-dose of continuous intravenous midazolam to sedate the patient. The cortical and subcortical lesions seen on DWI and FLAIR were seen to have progressed to the occipital area on the follow-up MRI. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) also revealed an elevated and inverted lactate peak with a normal N-acetyl-aspartate level (Fig. a) and 123I-IMP single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed increased uptake in the lesions that were involved on MRI (Fig. b). Repeated CSF analyses clarified the elevated level of lactate. These ancillary test results facilitated the possible diagnosis of MELAS, even though the episode was the first neurological event in the patient’s life. With the diagnosis of suspected MELAS, the oral coenzyme Q10 (90 mg/day), L-arginine hydrochloride (7.5 g/day), and vitamin B1 (225 mg/day) were administrated as additional therapies. On day 12, a muscle biopsy of the left biceps brachii was performed for the histopathological diagnosis and analyses of the mitochondrial genetic mutation. Modified Gomori-Trichrome staining of the specimens revealed some ragged-red fibers (Fig. ) and analyses of the mitochondrial gene revealed an mtDNA 14453G → A point mutation (Fig. ); this was accompanied by the mtDNA189A → G and 16129G → A point mutations, which were located in the D-loop region of the mtDNA.
With continued treatment, the patient’s disturbed consciousness and mental state gradually improved, but the mild left hemiparesis (MRC scale 4/5 for upper limbs and 4/5 for lower limbs) and cognitive impairment remained (modified Rankin Scale 2). On day 110, he was transferred to the rehabilitation hospital and his Barthel Index score was shown to have improved substantially (from a score of 10 to 80) after intensive rehabilitation.

The left pinna was found to be sore and reddish but without vesicles, which is why chondritis was diagnosed and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid prescribed. One day later she awaked with a peripheral facial nerve palsy on the left side and hypoesthesia of the left upper lip. The weeks before onset she had a lot of stress with her studies at the university but there was no fever, no vaccination, or infection. A few days before onset of the palsy she recognised dysesthesias of the parietal skull on the left side. The night before onset of the palsy she was exposed against the ventilator of an air condition for more than an hour. She was regularly taking loratadine.
Clinical neurologic examination on admission revealed slight hypoesthesia of the left upper lip, moderate peripheral facial nerve palsy, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. The left pinna showed an erythematous rash but no vesicles. Hearing and taste were normal and there was no vertigo, double vision, skew deviation, nystagmus, headache, hyposmia, or ataxia []. Blood chemical investigations revealed slight leucopenia but normal C-reactive protein. Ophthalmologic examinations excluded a zoster of the eye. Immediately after admission, she was treated with dexamethasone (40 mg intramuscularly) during two days followed by dexamethasone orally during another six days. Additionally, she received 750 mg acyclovir three times a day intravenously during eight days. For continuous pain periauricularly she received mefenamic acid and paracetamol with success.
At followup three days later she reported some transient vesicles at the left pinna, no longer visible at the visit, lid closure had improved, and there was recovery from the pinna's rash but only marginal voluntary innervation of the frontalis and lower facial muscles. Audiometry was normal. Followup six days after onset of the palsy showed complete lid closure but unchanged innervation of the other facial muscles. She reported neuralgiform pain in the left ear which is why gabapentin was prescribed with success. Eleven days after onset of facial palsy lid closure on the left side was complete. There were slight innervation of the frontal branch and only slight innervation of the left mouth corner. Nerve conduction studies 12 days after onset showed almost equal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude when recording from the orbicularis oculi muscle but >50% amplitude reduction on the left side when recording from the orbicularis oris muscle. Antibodies against the varicella zoster virus (VZV) were determined three times by means of an ELISA test. IgG antibodies against VZV were positive at all three determinations and IgM antibodies against VZV were negative at the first and positive at the second and third determination, which is why valacyclovir orally was given for seven days after discontinuation of acyclovir. Antibodies against other viruses and Borrelia burgdorferi were normal. Follow-up 6 weeks after onset showed further recovery of the palsy, such that it was no longer visible in the absence of emotional reactions. Nerve conduction studies confirmed the improvement such that the CMAP amplitude difference was only reduced to 30%.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?","{'sex': 'Female', 'height': [185.0, 'cm']}",75.02,71.269,78.771,"The patient's gender is Female.

AB described going to bed in his normal state of health. Upon awakening the following morning, he started experiencing severe weakness with inability to sit up in bed; requiring full assistance for activities of daily living. AB reported two episodes of similar presentation at the age of 12 years and most recently three months prior to this presentation. Muscle weakness during previous presentations was described as mild, transient, and self-limited, resolving in a matter of days. Also noted at time of presentation was a history of 40 lbs weight loss over two months in spite of increased appetite. AB denied palpitations, heat intolerance, dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, and change in bowel movements. The remaining review of systems was negative. AB has never smoked and denied use of diuretics, laxatives, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Patient denied use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medications. There was no known history of radiation or thyroid toxin exposure. Family history was negative for periodic paralysis or thyroid disorders.
Physical examination revealed a cachectic male who appeared his stated age, with blood pressure: 100/54 mmHg, pulse: 110 beats per minute, temperature: 98.7°F, respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation: 97% on room air. He was alert, oriented, and in no acute distress. Head exam was significant for temporal muscle wasting bilaterally, lid lag, orbital lag, and mild exophthalmos. Neck exam showed diffuse symmetric enlargement of thyroid gland with firm consistency and lack of bruit. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurologic exam was positive for brisk and symmetric patellar reflexes and fine tremors in bilateral hands with extension. Strength was 4/5 in all muscle groups of bilateral lower extremities. The remaining neurological examination was unremarkable.
Initial serum potassium on presentation to the emergency department was 1.9 mEq/L (3.5–5.1 mEq/L), with normal acid-base status that was confirmed on repeat testing. Previous serum potassium less than a month prior to this presentation was 4.9 mEq/L. Serum phosphorus: 3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL), magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL (1.6–2.3 mg/dL). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 108 beats per minute.
An initial clinical diagnosis of periodic hypokalemic paralysis was made. Treatment began with 20 mEq of intravenous potassium chloride (KCl) as well as 40 mEq of oral potassium in the emergency department and was then started on a normal saline infusion with 10 mEq/L of potassium. His serum potassium was checked four hours later and was 3.4 mEq/L. Re-examination at four hours was significant for complete resolution of lower extremity weakness with no change in the rest of his physical examination.
Serial measurements of his serum potassium level while in the hospital showed rapid improvement of his potassium with level of 4 mEq/L on hospital day 2. Initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level (TSH) returned at <0.02 mU/L (0.47–4.68 mIU/L), free thyroxine (T4) level: 5.5 ng/dL (0.8–2.2 ng/dL), and total triiodothyronine (TT3): 539 ng/dL (80–206 ng/dL).
Thyrotoxicosis was diagnosed, and the patient was given propranolol 10 mg PO three times a day (TID) as well as methimazole 10 mg PO TID. The patient’s thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level was elevated at 382% (<140%) and thyroid peroxidase antibody was 4 IU/mL (<9 IU/mL). Ultrasonography of the soft tissue of the neck showed mildly prominent thyroid gland with marked increased vascularity. The patient was discharged home with the diagnosis of TPP secondary to new onset Graves’ disease. At six week post-discharge follow-up, AB’s weight had returned to normal and there had been no more episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. His physical exam was remarkable for improved exophthalmos, lid lag, and orbital lag, and mild symmetric thyroid gland enlargement with absence of bruit. Repeat thyroid function tests at that time were as follows: TSH:<0.02 mU/L, free T4: 1.8 ng/dL, and TT3: 209 ng/dL.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?,"{'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [110.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Hemoptysis': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': False, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': False}",1.5,1.5,1.5,"The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.

4369,19,Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis,lab test,decimal,pmc-4722098-1,Extracted,"A 60-year-old woman was hospitalized for a week-long history of progressive dyspnea and general weakness. She had a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She had ingested approximate 14 g/day of alcohol for 20 years. She was acutely ill-looking and had an alert mental status. Upon admission, her vital signs included a blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, pulse of 76/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and body temperature of 36.8°C. Decreased breathing sounds and dullness to percussion were evident over the lower one-third of the right hemithorax. No friction rub was auscultated. Heart sounds were regular and there was no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpated. Palmar erythema, vascular spider, and peripheral edema were absent.
Initial laboratory data revealed albumin 3.2 g/dL, total protein 6.4 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 229 IU/L, aspartate transaminase/alanine aminotransferase of 33/24 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase of 801 IU/L, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine of 12.5/0.89 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 3430/mm3, hematocrit of 38.4%, platelet count of 150,000/mm3, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) of 1.08, C-reactive protein of 0.07 mg/dL, and blood analysis of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 257 ng/mL. Urinalysis revealed no proteinuria. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were not detected.
Chest X-ray showed a significant right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed and 1500 mL of the pleural effusion was drained. The pleural fluid was yellowish, and an analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, glucose of 212 mg/dL, LDH of 105 IU/L, protein of 3.0 g/dL, red blood cell count of 330/mm3, WBC count of 1/mm3, adenosine deaminase of 11.9 IU/L, and carcinoembryonic antigen of 2.5 mg/mL. Pleural fluid was transudate. Culture for bacteria as well as an acid-fast bacillus smear and culture were negative. No malignant cells were observed.
A chest computed tomography scan revealed no parenchymal lung disease or pleural thickening. On abdominal ultrasonography, the liver size and contour were within the normal range without evidence of ascites, but the liver parenchymal echogenicity was slightly increased, which was suggestive of fatty liver. We also performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed gastric erosion but no esophageal varices. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of cardiac disease.
We repeated the thoracentesis every 3 days for 2 weeks and empirically prescribed diuretics. The collected fluids were also transudate, but the right-sided pleural effusion was not improved.
Although laboratory findings and abdominal ultrasonography did not show the evidence of liver cirrhosis, due to her alcoholic history, we performed an examination using a transient elastography, which can measure liver stiffness. The transient elastography result was 35.3 Kpa, which was suggestive of liver cirrhosis. Accordingly, we suspected a hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. A radioisotope 99mTc-sulfur colloid injected in peritoneal cavity resulted in a positive uptake of radioactivity within the right pleural cavity (Fig. 
). This finding suggested that the pleural effusion originated in the peritoneal cavity and that there was a diaphragmatic defect.
We diagnosed the patient as having hepatic hydrothorax without ascites, which was the first sign of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Once the patient was started on a strict low salt diet and a water restriction with diuretics, the pleural effusion slowly regressed. After 2 months of treatment, the hydrothorax was resolved.",What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?,"{'age': [60, 'years'], 'Alanine aminotransferase': [24.0, 'U/L'], 'Aspartate aminotransferase': [33.0, 'U/L'], 'Platelet count': [150000.0, 'µL']}",2.694,2.559,2.829,"The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.
The patient's concentration of AST is 33.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of ALT is 24.0 U/L.
The patient's concentration of platelets is 150000.0 count/µL. To convert 150000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 150000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 150000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 150000000000.0/(10^9) = 150.0 billion platelet counts per liter.
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (60 * 33.0)/(150.0 * sqrt(24.0)) = 2.694.
Hence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 2.694."
873,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-8364690-1,Extracted,"A 78-year-old man diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome received a permanent pacemaker (DDDR-MRI Medtronic [ventricular lead (MEDTRONIC cistofix 5076–58 cm); atrial lead (MEDTRONIC cistofix 5076–52 cm)]). The procedure itself and the post-procedure screening were both uneventful. The wound was clean, and there was no evidence of pneumothorax or hemothorax on the chest X radiography (CXR). The patient was discharged on the second day after the procedure.
However, the patient complained of a productive cough during a routine outpatient clinic follow-up visit conducted a week after the procedure. Laboratory findings showed a decrease in hemoglobin level from 10.9 to 8.9 mg/dL. A CXR revealed newly developed borderline cardiomegaly and bilateral blunting of the diaphragmatic angle. Pacemaker interrogation results showed normal threshold and impedance of both leads. An evaluation performed at fourteen days after the procedure showed evidence of orthopnea, dyspnea upon exertion, and a minor fever (38 °C). Physical examination showed engorgement of the jugular vein, basal crackles over the bilateral lower lung fields, and pitting edema in both legs. Laboratory data revealed worsening anemia (decrease in hemoglobin level from 8.9 to 7.7 mg/dL), high NT-proBNP (1610 pg/ml), and hyponatremia (Na: 115 meq/L, Osmo: 267), but no leukocytosis or worsening of renal function. An echocardiography revealed moderate pericardial effusion (maximal thickness 1.5 cm) without dynamic diastolic collapse of the right ventricle (RV).
The patient was treated for congestion, and administered a nitrate infusion. The patient also received empirical treatment with antibiotics since the low-grade fever was suggestive of an infection. The workup for pleural effusion showed evidence of transudate, and culture results for microorganisms tested were negative, including common aerobic and anaerobic bacterium as well as mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on concerns about lead migration or protrusion-induced hemopericardium, the patient was subjected to chest computed tomography (CT), and no protrusion was detected (Fig. ). Additionally, the density of pericardial effusion was 20 Hounsfield unit (HU), which also did not support the possibility of hemopericardium. There was a limited improvement in the patient’s condition following several days of treatment, and echocardiography showed no worsening of pericardial effusion (thickness around 1.1 cm). Based on a suspicion of PCIS, the patient was prescribed prednisolone (30 mg/day initially), after which there was a dramatic improvement of his condition. The dosage of prednisolone was gradually tapered off to 20 mg/day after a week, 20 mg to 10 mg/day after two weeks, and the patient was maintained on 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. Although the CXR returned to baseline after completion of the steroid treatment (Fig. ), there was a recurrence of pleural effusion, leading to the resumption of low dose prednisolone treatment in addition to colchicine treatment. The patient recovered well after this treatment.
An 82-year-old male with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation (CHADS2: 3) was treated with rivaroxaban. The patient presented at the cardiology clinic with crescendo angina, and was reviewed with a coronary angiography examination, which showed significant focal stenosis at the orifice of the right coronary artery (RCA) (Fig. ). The patient was subjected to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where a Xience Xpedition stent (3.5/15 mm) was deployed at the orifice. The procedure was uneventful, and the final angiogram showed good RCA flow, and no evidence of perforation, dissection, or extravasations (Fig. ).
However, two hours after the procedure, the patient developed cold sweats, tightness in the chest, and hemodynamic compromise along with bradycardia (50 bpm) and hypotension (systolic blood pressure: 70–80 mm Hg). Although a complete electrocardiography (ECG) showed no abnormalities, echocardiography showed new pericardial effusion (thickness 1.1–1.5 cm) with RV early diastolic collapse. This was immediately followed by a repeat coronary angiography, which showed good RCA flow without any extravasation, perforation or thrombosis. A chest CT scan with contrast showed no aortic dissection, and the density of pericardial effusion suggested hemopericardium (HU: 40) (Fig. ). In addition to vasopressors which were administered to stabilize the hemodynamics, the patient was also prescribed a 50 mg dose of hydrocortisone for PCIS. There was an improvement in the patient’s condition on the second day and all vasopressors was discontinued in 18 h. The patient was discharged to the outpatient department with a prescription for 20 mg prednisolone, and remained stable at his follow-up visits. However, 9 months later, after we tapered off prednisolone, the patient had increased discomfort of dyspnea on exertion and the echocardiography showed pericardial effusion recurred. We prescribed colchicine and low dose prednisolone for its control and patient’s discomfort improved.",What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?,"{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [82, 'years'], 'Congestive Heart Faliure': False, 'Stroke': False, 'Transient Ischemic Attacks History': False, 'Thromboembolism history': False, 'Vascular disease history': True, 'Diabetes history': False}",3,3,3,"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.

On examination, her vital signs showed a temperature of 37°C, blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% in room air. Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.4%, total bilirubin of 32.0 μmol/L (normal: 3-20 μmol/L), direct bilirubin of 21.0 μmol/L (normal: 0-6.8 μmol/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase of 1125 U/L (normal: 5-36 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase of 126.8 U/L (normal: <37 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase of 333.9 U/L (normal: <35 U/L). She had undergone MC for a gallstone 5 weeks earlier and reported no history of iatrogenic or other liver injury. Because she had recurrent symptoms of a microlithiasis before MC, a magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) was performed to exclude choledocholith and anomalies of the biliary system. Preoperative MRCP revealed a normal biliary tree structure.
Two days after admission, an axial MR image revealed hemorrhagic fluid in the gallbladder fossa and the subcapsular portion of the liver and an abnormal extrahepatic bile duct (Figures and ). An upper endoscopy revealed gastritis and blood clots at the papilla of Vater. Abdominal ultrasound revealed only fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa. Five days after admission, she developed mild epigastric pain and significant hematemesis again. The epigastric pain worsened with radiation to the right upper shoulder. In addition, hematemesis led to hemodynamic instability. After resuscitation, the patient was transferred to the Department of Interventional Radiology (The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical College, Hohhot, China). Emergency angiography confirmed the formation of right HAP with active bleeding. Coil embolization was immediately performed on her to control bleeding (Figures and ).
